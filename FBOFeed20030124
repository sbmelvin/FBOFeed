<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the operation of the MSFC Physical Exercise Program (PEP).	This procurement is for the administration of a PEP available to all MSFC civil service personnel and on-site contractors. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Actuisition Procedures (SAP) -- FAR Subpart 13.5. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from the NASA Exchange-MSFC.  This procurement is for the administration of a PEP available to all MSFC civil service personnel and on-site contractors.  This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority for 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons:		  Pursuant to NPD 9050.6 (as revised):  NASA Center Directors may establish a NASA Exchange to operate activities contributing to the efficiency, welfare, and morale of NASA personnel.  The policy further allows NASA Exchanges to (a) promote activities contributing to the efficiency, welfare, and morale of NASA employees, and (b) to use and acquire real property and facilities to achieve Exchange objectives.   NASA Headquarters requires all Centers to provide a PEP for active civil service personnel with the concept that a preventive health program should enhance the efficiency, welfare, and morale of NASA personnel.  The NASA Exchange-MSFC has the space and exercise equipment allocated for all fitness/exercise activities at MSFC.  The NASA Exchange-MSFC has operated the Wellness Center at MSFC since 1996 consistent with NPD 9050.6 (as revised).  MSFC management has determined that this approach continues to be the most economical and advantageous means to accomplish this requirement. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 10, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Department of the Treasury, Departmental Offices intends to award a limited eight (8) week contract on a sole source basis to Boston Consulting Group, 4800 Hampton Lane, #500, Bethesda, MA  20814 for the following:  the development and assessment of alternative scenarios for transitioning the Department of the Treasury personnel to the new entity, including estimated financial and operational impact; the development of detailed implementation plans to ensure a successful transition; the development and assessment of options for restructuring the organization after the divestiture has occurred, including roles, responsibilities and resources of different entities and leaders; the development of detailed implementation plans to ensure successful restructuring of the organization; the systematic review of opportunities to reduce or eliminate costs in the organization on a going forward basis to support the cost reduction goals of the overall effort; the development and tracking of critical metrics and milestones that can be used to manage change effectively across the entire organization and; management support for key operational decisions that are not related to the transition but that need to be made during the course of it.  Due to the commitment of meeting the President?s Homeland Security expectations without any risk of completing critical milestones within pre-established schedules and; because of the massive size of the task, the conflicting interests of the House, Senate, unions, White House, GAO, etc.; the extreme urgency of transferring Custom, Secret Service, Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and FLETC to the newly established Department of Homeland Security and; the requirement to identify and transfer  40% of administrative support, as well as unique program talent regardless of ?behavioral? concerns, Treasury seeks a contractor with demonstrated programmatic expertise (i.e. inner knowledge of how the ?New Treasury? must be organized to meet customer/administration expectations) and demonstrated issues expertise (recognizing this is essentially a divestiture of functions with a 40% downsizing).  Therefore, it is considered that only Boston Consulting Group (based on continuation of service and corporate knowledge) has the requisite management, technical capability, programmatic experience, issue experience and resources to accomplish this effort within the current schedule and budget constraints.  Statutory authority for award of this contract is 10 U.S.C. 2304(2)(b)(1)(2) as implemented by FAR 6.302-2 ?Unusual and Compelling Urgency.?  The Government anticipates award of this contract on or about February 03, 2003.  No award will be made on the basis of any quotations/proposals or other information received in response to this notice since this is a notification of intent to acquire and not a request for proposals.  All inquires can be made to:  The Department of the Treasury, Departmental Offices, Procurement Services Division, Room 1310 ?G?

<SUBJECT>A--Alternatives for Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl4) Source Term Location
<SOLNBR>DE-RA26-03NT41735
<CONTACT>Raymond Johnson, Contracting Officer, Contact Contract Specialist, johnson@netl.doe.gov;Denise Riggi, Contract Specialist, 304-285-4241, driggi@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>The Department of Energy's (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) announces the availability of Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) No. DE-RA26-03NT41735 entitled "Alternatives for Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl4) Source Term Location," expected to be published on or about January 31, 2003.   The PRDA supports the mission of the Office of Science & Technology (OST), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management (EM), U.S. Department of Energy  (DOE). The objective of this procurement is to select and demonstrate innovative technologies for characterizing and quantifying the remaining carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) as a dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) in the subsurface.  The DNAPL source term contamination is potentially located in both the vadose zone and saturated zone in difficult subsurface conditions and possibly acting as a continuing source to groundwater contamination. Verifying the existence of DNAPL is required to develop a long-term remediation strategy. The proposed work will be accomplished in two phases.   In the first phase, the selected vendor(s) will be expected to develop a viable conceptual model for locating the presence/absence of DNAPL in the unconfined aquifer and evaluate/propose characterization technologies to validate the model.  It is expected that one or two contractor (s) will be selected from the Phase I contractor(s) to proceed into Phase II.  The selected contractor (s) would perform in Phase II the  characterization activities proposed in Phase I to confirm the conceptual model that will describe the nature, extent and mass of the DNAPL with the objective of supporting a step-change remedial action decision. At the DOE Hanford 200 West Area, CCl4 is present in the vadose zone and groundwater.  The vadose zone and unconfined aquifer consist of a thick accumulation of unconsolidated to semi-indurated sediments composed of silts, sands, and gravels.  The water table is located at approximately 225 ft. below ground surface (bgs), and groundwater flows within a multi-aquifer system. A plume of dissolved CCl4 that resulted from past discharges extends over 11 square kilometers in the unconfined aquifer under 200 West Area. The highest concentration of CCl4 detected in the 200 West Area groundwater was approximately 8,000 ug/L.  Dissolved CCl4 has been observed deep within the unconfined aquifer (greater than 30 feet below water table) and within the uppermost confined aquifer approximately 500-ft. bgs.  Difficult conditions that hamper assessment of the plume in the 200 West Area include the complex sediment facies that control fluid transport, gravel lenses, well-cemented caliche layers, man-made obstructions (buildings, tanks, others), and extensive and deep contamination.  Costs to characterize and monitor this deep and large plume with conventional technologies such as drilling and sampling are excessive, and significant cost-savings could be realized with improved methods. In 1999 the U.S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office (RL) requested the assistance of the Innovative Treatment Remediation Demonstration (ITRD) program to provide technical support to assist with the evaluation and selection of technologies applicable at Hanford for characterization and remediation of CCl4 contamination in ground water and the vadose zone.  A Technical Advisory Group (TAG), consisting of RL and contractor project leads, technical experts, regulators, stakeholders and Tribal representatives, was formed for this project.  The TAG identified and reviewed approximately thirty technologies they considered applicable to enhance remediation of the CCl4 contamination.  The advisory group suggested additional modeling and characterization activities to assist in developing a final recommendation for implementation of a remediation strategy for the CCl4 plume.  Early in the evaluation process, it was recognized that if DNAPL exists in the subsurface, then definition of the location and estimation of the volume of the DNAPL source was required before treatment technologies could be evaluated.  In response, the ITRD performed an initial review of characterization technologies. Examples of Innovative characterization technologies identified by the ITRD program that might be applicable to Hanford include:  direct push drilling methods such as the cone penetrometer, noninvasive methods such as geophysical technologies, DNAPL volume estimation using Partitioning Interwell Tracer Test (PITT), etc.  All of these technologies offer the advantage of locating and estimating the volume of DNAPL in the subsurface more efficiently and at a much lower cost than standard drilling methods used in the baseline approach.  A listing of the technologies evaluated in the ITRD will be made available with the solicitation. The ITRD program completed a groundwater modeling study and report of the Hanford CCl4 plume in April 2001.  The modeling, performed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), was to provide an indication of the potential impact of the CCl4 source on the compliance boundary (edge of central plateau) approximately 5,000 m from the source area.  The primary results of the modeling bracket the amount of CCl4 source that will most likely result in compliance or noncompliance at the boundary and the relative influence of the various modeling parameters.  Modeling reports will be made available with the solicitation. Currently, a Work Plan for regulatory approval is being developed to guide the Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) for the 200-PW-1 Operable Unit (DOE/RL-2001-01, Draft B).  This Operable Unit (OU) includes the Hanford CCl4 vadose zone plume associated with the waste disposal sites and other parts of the vadose zone.  A feasibility study is planned following the RI activities to support a Proposed Plan and Record of Decision for the 200-PW-1 OU Waste Sites and the CCl4 vadose zone plume by 2006.  The 200-PW-1 RI consists of two major parts: (1) a known source term waste site characterization effort which is focused on improving the understanding of the vertical distribution of CCl4 and radionuclides in the vadose zone beneath the waste sites, and (2) a dispersed CCl4 vadose zone plume characterization focused on identifying previously unknown surface sources of CCl4 and potential vadose zone sources that may be continuing to contaminate groundwater.  Investigation of the known source term waste sites in FY03 will involve drilling two wells directly in the waste pits and trenches taking limited samples at different depth horizons. Results of this drilling program will be available towards the end of FY03 or early FY04. The dispersed CCl4 vadose zone plume will be investigated in two steps.  Step I, which began in FY02, uses direct push technology to sample the shallow depths below and around the plant piping and other subsurface infrastructure which could have leaked significant amounts of the solvent, and step II will investigate the intermediate to deep vadose zone to the top of the water table.  Results of the step I investigation will be available in mid-FY03 and the results of the step II investigation will be available mid-FY04. The current baseline for the site includes obtaining a final record of decision for the carbon tetrachloride plume by 2024 to meet final remediation goals for the Hanford 200-Area.  The Hanford Site goals included in the PMP call for implementation of a final remedy for both groundwater and the vadose zone by 2012.  The goal of this project is the confirmation of a conceptual model(s) in FY04, that will describe the nature, extent and mass of the DNAPL. Achievement of this goal will provide the necessary information to reduce the risk in meeting RL?s specific commitment to:  (1) complete a carbon tetrachloride DNAPL field investigation by 2004 stated in Strategic Initiative 6 in the Hanford PMP and (2) the regulatory agencies prior to the CERCLA 5-Year Review scheduled in 2005 to support implementing changes to the current remedial action decision. A pre-proposal conference will be held in Richland, Washington on February 11, 2003 to present site specific information.  In order to prepare for the pre-proposal conference/site tour, prior to close of business (4:00 p.m. PST) on February 4, 2003, you are asked to provide the company name, address, telephone, facsimile, and E-mail address, as well as the number (limit of 2 individuals per company), names, and dates of birth of persons (only US citizens),  planning to attend the pre-proposal conference/site tour by sending an E-mail notice to Scott_W_Petersen@rl.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY-THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSAL.  The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for PHASE II - RENOVATION CONSTRUCTION SERVICES for the Frank M. Johnson, Jr., Federal Building 15 Lee Street in downtown Montgomery, Alabama.  In response to this notice, Construction Contractors may request to be put on the Bidder?s Mailing List (BML) by submitting a one-page letter to the attention of Wylene Bell, Contracting Officer (4PCA), General Services Administration (GSA), Property Development Division, 401 West Peachtree Street, N.W., Suite 2513, Atlanta, GA 30308.  Offerors may request to be put on the BML up until the issuance of the Request For Proposal (RFP).  All correspondence in response to this announcement must clearly indicate the Solicitation Number GS-04P-02-EXC-0077.  The tentative date for the issuance of the RFP is scheduled for February 6, 2003.  A Pre-Proposal Conference is tentatively scheduled to be held approximately ten days following the issuance of the RFP, to answer questions that offerors may have concerning the scope of services and evaluation criteria.  A Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session (this session is for small business subcontractors to be given an opportunity to network with potential prime contractors) is scheduled to immediately follow the Pre-Proposal Conference.  The contractor selected will be required to furnish all labor, equipment, materials, tools, transportation, and supervision to renovate the building as required by the RFP.  The U. S. District Court, U. S. Circuit Court, U. S. Probation Office, U. S. Marshal Service, U.S. Senate Office and other Federal Agencies will occupy the facility.  The facility is approximately 138,000 gross square feet (12,820 square meters) with 77,000 occupied square feet.  Renovation completion time for this project is approximately 300 calendar days.

The applicable NAICS Code for this procurement is 233320 with a Small Business Size Standard of $27.5 million.  A General Construction Contractor will be procured for the above services utilizing Source Selection procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15.  The Government contemplates the award of a Firm-Fixed Priced (FFP) type contract.  The best value continuum concept will be utilized for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful offeror.  The best value approach provides the opportunity for cost/technical tradeoffs; therefore, award will not necessarily be made to the lowest priced offer or the highest technically ranked offer. The Government will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of both price and technical factors.  All technical evaluation factors total score is significantly more important than cost (or price). The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The following technical evaluation factors will be evaluated.  1) Firm's Past Performance in Providing Similar Construction Services (400 Points).  The offeror is required to (a) Demonstrate past performance by listing and submitting references on at least three similar size CONSTRUCTION projects that it, as a prime contractor, has performed.  (b) Demonstrate past performance and ability in working in a non-adversarial relationship with an owner/developer, including litigation avoidance.   (c) Demonstrate compliance with subcontracting goals in past performance; 2) Firm's Staffing Plan and Experience of Key Personnel (400 Points).  The offeror is required to (a) Demonstrate construction experience with proposed staff (at least five years experience) in key positions on similar size project that would ensure a reasonable expectation of project success.  (b) Provide a complete and rational staffing plan; 3) Firm's Past Experience and Knowledge of the Construction Market in the Montgomery, Alabama area (200 Points) ? The offeror is required to (a) Demonstrate past experience by listing and submitting references on at least three CONSTRUCTION projects that it, as a prime contractor, has performed within 100 miles of Montgomery, AL.  The following are responsibility requirements for proposal submissions.  All proposals submitted must furnish a bid/bond guarantee in accordance with FAR 28.101-2.  The bonding corporate surety must appear on the list contained in the Department of Treasury Circular 570-Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds and Acceptable reinsuring Companies or acceptability of Individual Sureties.  Prior to award, the apparent awardee must submit an acceptable "Subcontracting Plan" to include a Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan, as applicable, and required by the FAR Clause 52.219.9 Small Business, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan.

<DESC>This requirement will be negotiated solely with Electronics Development Corporation (EDC), 9055F Guilford Road, Columbia, Maryland 21046, the designer.  The effort includes repackaging of the proximity sensor in the multi-optic fuze, artillery (MOFA).  The following tasks are needed to provide the appropriate support to the program: A. MOFA Proximity Sensor Design Support, i. Provide system and circuit support to assist in selecting specific implementation, schematic, and hardware for integration of the design into the overall system; ii. Provide input for and objective review of particular sections of the height of burst interface control document (HOB ICD), as appropriate.  In particular, adequate information to define the pin interfaces for both the monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) and the directional Doppler ratio (DDR) signal processor ASIC (application speci fic integrated circuit) is required.  B. Guidance Integrated Fuzing (GIF) Hardware Support (Repackaging), i.Layout/procure multi-layer PWBs.  The Demo effort requires repackaging of the entire HOB circuitry to a more space efficient design.  The design and test effort will require PWBs for all-up subsystem testing and for chip-specific testing. 1. All-Up Subsystem.  Repackaging requirements dictate use of significantly different components from that allotted for current MOFA implementation.  Efforts will include help with optimizing component layout to minimize development costs while operating within design constraint space bounded by component specs (e.g., 10 percent vs. 1 percent resistor tolerances), number of board layers, and overall footprint of subassembly; 2. Chip-Specific.  Shock testing of the repackaged ASIC chip design may require a simple yet unique board for moun ting in the airgun and verifying chip package survival across shock.  Parallel activities to meet overall program schedule may dictate design of a simple, 1 or 2 layer board for testing the repackaged chip independent of the overall subsystem repackaged design.  Help with the layout and procurement of this design may be required.  ii. Procure parts.  Total quantities for this Demo effort will be 12:  2 items for potential gun shot integration, 5 items for shock testing (i.e., airgun), and 5 items for lab testing. 1. MMIC / Antenna subassemblies.  Existing MOFA MMICS and antennae are baselined.  A total of 17 items will be required:  12 items acquired for integration / testing and an additional 5 items acquired for backup.  2. DDR ASICs.  Ongoing investigations are exploring opportunities to use the current MOFA ASIC (unmodified HDL-103) and / or possibly repackaging the associa ted die into a more efficient package.  Required support to include providing existing chips, acquiring unpackaged dies, and investigating alternative packaging schemes from traditional and non-traditional chip packaging houses.  We will ultimately require 12 items for integration, but an additional 10 items for non-integrated environmental testing and backup is required. 3. Additional support items (resistors, capacitors, etc.) will be required to fully develop the HOB circuits.  As appropriate, acquisition of these items to meet schedule will be required.  iii. Assemble PWBs. All up assemblies.  12 all-up assemblies are required for HOB subsystem environmental shock testing and performance characterization. C.  Component Testing.  i. All up Assemblies.  12 all-up assemblies are required for HOB subsystem environmental shock testing and performance characterization. ii. Additi onal PWBs for environmental testing of the repackaged ASIC (if appropriate) will be required.  The additional boards will be appropriately designed to verify integrity of repackaged chip.  D. MOFA Proximity Sensor Test Support. i. Test Plan Development.  Provide input to and objective review of an overall test plan for the PWB. ii. Verify Performance.  Provide data and/or MOFA hardware for comparison purposes.  Comparison of the performance of the PWB and MMIC/Antenna assembly to the MOFA assembly is required.  Values to be compared include, but are not limited to, bandwidth, center frequency, and power output of the MMIC/Antenna assembly and I/O waveforms/response of the ASIC located on the PWB. iii. Testing Facility.  As required, provide facilities to perform performance testing of the repackaged proximity sensor (PWB and MMIC/Antenna assembly).  This may require developmen t of an interface for the PWB.  Testing that may be required includes radio frequency (RF) Range Simulation and board level testing of the PWB. iv. Environmental testing.  Principal environmental testing will be gun shock survivability assessment of any repackaged components and subassemblies.  Support may include assisting with board layout, procurement, and/or population.  Additional support will include assistance with pre- and post-test characterization of test items. This effort must be complete by 30 September 2003.  Interested parties other than EDC must be able to demonstrate in writing by 28 January 2003, their capability to provide the requested services.  Please reference the RFQ Number N00178-03-Q-1013 when forwarding your requested information.

<DESC>U.S. Radiologic Technologists Cohort: New Strategies for Follow-up and Detailed Study of Radiation, Genetic Factors, and Risk of Cancer and Benign High Risk Conditions RFP:  N01-CP-31018-50.  
The Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) of the National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Radiation Epidemiology Branch proposes to enter into a sole source contract with the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455.  This requirement will provide for a five-year contract for continued follow-up of 146,000 U.S. radiologic technologists to quantify cancer risks associated with chronic low- to moderate-dose radiation exposures, and genetic and molecular factors that may modify risk.  The University of Minnesota has been under contract (NO1-CP-21015, N01-CP-15673, N01-CP-51016) to the National Cancer Institute since 1982 to conduct two questionnaire surveys for cancer incidence and to establish a repository of biological samples for genetic studies. The scientific design and oversight of the activities are the responsibility of the REB professional staff.  The major tasks of the contract include:  (1) conduct three mini-surveys (2-4 pages each) of about 100,000 radiologic technologists to update occurrence of incident cancers, benign high-risk conditions, and selected other serious health outcomes, and collect other information (e.g., Mini-survey #1: obtain further clarification of work history and practices to refine retrospective dose estimates for individual cohort members; Mini-survey #2: update and add reproductive risk factor information; Mini-survey #3: update and extend family history of cancer and related disorders); (2) medically validate approximately 11,500 cancers and 2,300 other health outcomes (e.g., benign breast disease, thyroid nodules) reported by technologists on the mini-surveys by obtaining pathology or other medical records (note that the majority of cancers will be validated through linkage with state cancer registries under a separate contract); (3) collect blood samples from about 2,200 incident cases with breast cancer, benign breast diseases, thyroid cancer, and thyroid nodules and from a stratified random sample of 3,000 cohort members for comparison; and (4) collect prospective blood spots or buccal cells (depending on results of a pilot study) from approximately 50,000 cohort members who respond to Mini-survey #1 for future investigations.  The names of the key personnel and their experience in these tasks shall be provided with the technical proposal.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) (ii).  See numbered Note 22.  Numbered Note 22 applies as follows: The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contractor based upon responses to this notice is soley within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station (NSWCDD CSS), Panama City, Florida, intends to award a sole-source purchase order to Neptune Sciences, Inc. of Slidell, LA for a commercially available Sentry Directional Wave Buoy system to augment and upgrade the current Neptune Sciences suite of equipment in use at the NSWCDD CSS Coastal Test Range. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The upgrade equipment will be required to interface with and be 100% backward compatible with the existing Neptune Tactical Oceanographic Wave System (TOWS) hardware and software currently in use on the range. This level of compatibility and integration are required to prevent data loss during at sea operations. Use of any other manufacturers equipment would cost the Government additional time and money while attempting  to integrate the different systems that in turn would negatively impact the range schedule of tests. Thus Neptune Sciences Inc. is the only vendor that can meet this requirement. NAICS Code 326299 applies. Size standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Interior intends to award a sole source contract to Seacraft Shipyard Corporation (SSC) to retrofit and repair the L/P Guadalupe River Vessel belonging to the Galapagos National Park and Marine Reserve. The 100'foot, aluminum vessel is key to conducting mission-oriented services that include: short and long term law enforcement patrols, conduct scientific research, and ferry employees and supplies among the many islands of the archipelago. This is a crucial piece of equipment to the Galapagos National Park and Marine Reserve and its safe and efficient operation is paramount to the successful operations there. The U.S Department of Interior necessitates that location and shortest turn around time to retrofit the vessel is imperative to satisfy the agency's requirement. In addition, SSC has the capability to send its technicians to Galapagos National Park and Marine Reserve when it comes to servicing their installed equipment. If it comes to a point where the vessel needs repairs beyond the capability of the board mechanic, SSC will be able to accommodate the need. Delay of award would put serious injury to the mission of the Galapagos National Park and Marine Reserve. Since the vessel is utilized for law enforcement exercises; lack of the vessel due to delays in repairs could impede the security of the facilities as well as the scientific research and transportation services.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Rural School and Community Trust for the design and implementation of the Traditional Fisheries Knowledge Pilot Project (TFKPP).  TFKPP is an outreach project that will develop and implement a school curriculum on fishermen's traditional knowledge of fish, fish habitat, and other aspects of commercial and recreational fishing, designed for school aged children (K-12).  The project draws on two separate theoretical traditions.  The first is the scientific study of traditional knowledge.  The second is the successful educational model called place based learning which works by connecting classroom activities in local schools to their local communities through innovative curriculum that gets the students out of the classroom and into their community, which then becomes the context for learning. Student-collected traditional knowledge will be entered into a searchable database maintained by NOAA Fisheries.  The pilot project will be sited in a local fishing community school system in Maine, piggy-backing on a successful existing project that uses place based learning in Washington County, Maine developed by The Rural School and Community Trust.   The curriculum will be instituted during the 2003-04 school year.  NOAA Fisheries has an on-going interest in developing new community outreach projects that will encourage young people to choose careers in fisheries science and management to ensure there are sufficient new recruits for future staffing needs. It also has an interest in improving agency relationships with fishing communities affected by agency regulatory activity. Further, the agency has a scientific interest in enhancing the collection and analysis of scientific data that can be used to support legislatively mandated assessments of fish stocks, as well as  their associated industries and communities that depend on them to make a living. The pilot project addresses all three needs. If the pilot is successful, the agency will replicate it in other fishing communities throughout the country as funds permit. A sample of the Statement Of Work is provided, as an attachment, for informational purposes only.  All responsible sources shall respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability sufficient for the Government to determine if interested parties are viable. This is not a solicitation.  See Note 22.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) No. D36050.  These solicitation clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27.  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code for this acquisition is 7379 and the North American Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541512.  The FDA intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to the Cygnus Corporation for the following service entitled:  Migration of Legacy Data and Documentation of Drawing Rules for Drug Substance Registration System.  The contractor will review the legacy substances of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and will identify those that need to be represented as mixtures, i.e., as combinations of distinct structures.  Working with CDER?s registration staff, the contractor will enter structure and related data for these mixtures and will validate these data.  Additional tasks to be completed by the contractor include: (1) In collaboration with CDER?s drug registration staff, prepare a document summarizing rules for drawing structures for CDER?s molecular registration system.  This document will be used as guidance for future registration operations; (2) Conduct the migration of newly entered and validated structure data into the registration system database; (3) Assist in planning and implementing the linkage with systems of the National Library of Medicine.  The work will assist CDER personnel in implementing an operational registration system utilizing ISIS molecular registration software provided by MDL Information Systems.  The contractor will provide brief, monthly reports detailing accomplishments during prior month, contract resources expended and remaining, and plans for remainder of project.  The final product will be a registration database containing CDER?s legacy substances, in the format required by MDL?s registration software along with appropriate documentation.  Period of performance is six months from the date of the award.  The following FAR Clauses shall apply to this solicitation: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; and 52.232-33 Electronic Funds Transfers.  All responsible sources that can provide and meet the above requirements shall submit written quotations by the due date referenced above.  The award is being issued on a sole source basis because Cygnus Corporation has worked on similar information management systems using ISIS technology and has worked with CDER in analyzing National Library of Medicine requirements to interface with CDER?s registration system.  They are uniquely familiar with the rule set for the registration system and issues involved in defining it.  Cygnus qualifications include experience with and understanding of CDER requirements for chemical compound registration.  Their qualifications will reduce the cost of the project and will provide assurance of implementing the registration system in a timely manner.  FAR provisions can be found on the following website: http://www/arnet.gov.

Evaluation Criteria

Technical

The Government will evaluate each offer using the following criteria.  The Technical Evaluator shall be given all technical proposals and shall rate each against the criteria specified below.  Technical proposals will be evaluated in terms of the quality and relevance of information presented.  Each criteria element is equal in importance. The technical merit evaluations are:

2)	Relevant prior experience
3)	Past performance

Technical proposals must include information addressing each of the above criteria.  Additionally, the technical proposal must include resumes* of the key individuals assigned to the BPA.  

*If specific experience is not currently on the individual's resume, then the contractor must indicate when and how such expertise was obtained by the individual.  The contractor will not train staff under this BPA.   

Offerors must submit an original and one copy of the technical proposal.

Price

Price will be evaluated separately.  The Government may use price analysis to evaluate the total proposed price, not only to determine whether the price is fair and reasonable, but also to determine the understanding of the work and ability to perform.  Price must include all costs such as travel, parking, hourly rates, materials and other expenses associated with the delivery of this service.

In order to evaluate price, please complete your proposed hourly rate and extended total for performing the services described in this solicitation.  Offerors may submit more than one labor category.  If more than one labor category is proposed, the 120 hours will be divided equally among the labor categories proposed in order to determine the total estimated price to perform these services.

Labor Category	Est. Hours/Year	Proposed Hr. Rate	Extended Total
Consultant	120 Hours	$______________	$ ___________
(Add other Labor categories as necessary)

Offeror should submit an original and one copy of their pricing proposal.  


Award

A single BPA will be established with the offeror the offer that presents the best value to the OPM.  In determining best value, OPM will consider primarily technical excellence and secondarily the total estimated proposed price for performing these services.  For this procurement, technical excellence is significantly more important than price in the Government making its award decision.  The Government reserves the right to make an 
Award to a vendor offering other than the lowest evaluated price.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The U.S. Department of State (DOS), Office of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) is seeking to prequalify firms for a Renovation Design-Build Construction project in Frankfurt, Germany.  The Department anticipates award of a Firm Fixed-Price contract.  The purpose of the project is to convert the 469th Contingency Hospital Complex, previously operated and maintained by the US Department of Defense, to the site for the location of the US Consulate, Frankfurt, Germany.  The project will be design-build.  The US Government will provide conceptual design documents with the Phase II solicitation package.  The 469th Contingency Hospital includes over 70,000 gross square meters (GSM).  THE BUILDING IS MADE UP OF 11 WINGS, RANGING FROM 2 TO 6 STORIES, PLUS SEVERAL SMALL ADDITIONS ON A 10 HECTARE COMPOUND.  THIS PROJECT WILL INCLUDE RENOVATION OF 10 OF THE 11 WINGS.  THE FINAL WING WILL BE OCCUPIED BY A TENANT ORGANIZATION THAT WILL CONTRACT FOR RENOVATION OF THEIR WING BY SEPARATE CONTRACT AND ACQUISITION.  Most wings are confined around double loaded corridors.  The original wings were constructed between 1938 and 1943 by the Government of Germany, while later wings were added by the US Government through the 1980s.  The facility was in continuous use as a hospital until 1992, and maintained as a contingency hospital until 2001.

THE PROJECT, WITH MINIMAL WORK, WILL CONVERT THE EXISTING PATIENT ROOMS IN 10 OF THE 11 WINGS INTO CONSULATE OFFICES, CONSULAR OFFICES, PUBLIC DIPLOMACY FACILITIES, CLASSROOMS, AND SEVERAL PERSONNEL ACCESS CONTROLS. THIS PROJECT INCLUDES CONVERSION OF BUILDING 338 TO QUARTERS FOR PEOPLE UNDER GOVERNMENT TRAVEL ORDERS AND BUILDING 339 TO A MARINE SECURITY GUARD QUARTERS.  BOTH BUILDINGS WERE PREVIOUSLY UTILIZED AS MILITARY DORMITORIES.  ALSO INCLUDED IS THE CONSTRUCTION OF PARKING AREAS, SIDEWALKS,  AND MINOR ROAD RECONFIGURATION.  THE CONVERSION WILL INCLUDE TELEPHONE, DATA, POWER, NEW BOILER, SECURITY, AND FIRE PROTECTION UPGRADES.  THE PROJECT WILL ALSO INCLUDE TWO NEW WAREHOUSES OF APPROXIMATELY 7,500 GSM AND 1,000 GSM AND THE DEMOLITION OF FIVE TEMPORARY BUILDINGS.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) along with NCI's contractor, SAIC-Frederick Inc., plan to jointly conduct systems development for ovarian cancer diagnosis utilizing the Applied Biosystems Q-Star mass spectrometer on or about February 1, 2003 in anticipation of a clinical trial pursuant to an FDA Pre-market Application.  Q-ToF mass spectrometry coupled with pattern recognition software can differentiate protein expression levels in serum from ovarian cancer patients versus healthy individuals by displaying diagnostic patterns of protein expression in the disease state (Lancet 359, 572-577).  Thus, this technology may offer a non-invasive method to detect ovarian cancer in the early stages.  Questions concerning this effort may be directed to Kevin Brand, J.D., Technology Transfer Branch, NCI; phone: 301-496-0477, email: brandk@mail.nih.gov.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC)/Specialized Contracts Office (AXC) invites prospective contractors to review the Request for Quotes F04701-03-AXC1 (TASS) and F04701-03-AXC2 (FASS).  It is the intent of SMC/AXC to issue additional TASS and FASS Blanket Purchase Agreements to support the purchase of Financial and Technical/Management Advisory and Assistance Services by the issuance of delivery orders against GSA Group 70 Multiple Award Schedule contracts.  There is no closing date for this announcement.  The NAICS Code for this action is 513310, Communication and Subgroup, Telephone Communication (which includes Satellite Facilities) and defines a small business as 1500 employees.  SMC/AXC recommends that contractors form teaming relationships for this effort.  In order to have a TASS or FASS BPA, a contractor must be determined qualified in accordance with the evaluation criteria provided and must have a GSA Group 70, Information Technology, Federal Supply Schedule.  In order to be qualified team member, a contractor must have a GSA Federal Supply Schedule Contract.  The TASS requirement is for the acquisition of services and support covering the following 6 core competencies and their associated sub elements:  1) Systems Engineering and Integration (Requirements Analysis, Modeling and Simulation, Systems Safety and Environmental Impact, and Test and Evaluation); 2) Management Services (Configuration and Data Management and Management Service); 3) Specialty Acquisition Support (Manufacturing and Producibility, Quality Assurance, Reliability and Maintainability (R), Electromagnetic Interference/Compatibility (EMI/EMC), and Facilities and Ground Support); 4) Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) (ILS Performance Planning, Packaging, Handling, Storage, and Transportation (PHS), and Continuous Acquisition and Life Cycle Support (CALS)); 5) Computer Resources and Software (Computer Resources and Software Engineering and Office Automation); and 6) Acquisition Security (Acquisition Security Support, Space System(s) Protection Program Support, Systems Security Engineering (SSE), and Acquisition Security Training, Orientations, and Conferences).  The FASS requirement is for the following 10 core competencies: Cost Estimating, Cost-related research, Training, Acquisition reports, Commitment/Obligation/Expenditure Reconciliation, Earned Value Analysis, Market Analysis/Priced-Based Acquisition, Activity-Based Costing/Management (ABC/M), Total Ownership Cost (TOC), and Scheduling.  Note:  TASS Delivery Orders for Management Services, competency number 2, and all FASS Delivery Orders will be 100% set-aside for small business participation only.  The ordering period under these BPAs is anticipated to be 12 months, with possible extensions up to a total of five years (60 months) from BPA award or GSA FSS contract period (including options), whichever occurs first.  The Government reserves the right not to extend or to cancel BPAs in which the contractor fails to perform in accordance with the BPA or the Delivery Order, or in which the contractor has not received Delivery Orders.  The performance period may be longer than the ordering period depending on Delivery Order circumstances and length.  Additionally, the Government will incorporate the following option clauses into the BPA for use on individual Delivery Orders; 1) Option to Extend the Term of the Contract and 2) Option to Extend Services.  To prevent conflicting roles, which may bias the contractor's judgment or objectivity, and to preclude the contractor from obtaining an unfair competitive advantage in concurrent or future acquisitions, the contractor will be required to accept an Organizational Conflict of Interest clause in the BPA.  Additionally, the BPA will contain a Financial of Interest clause.  The contractor must possess, or be able to obtain, an Industrial Facility Clearance of Top Secret at the time of award.  Personnel supporting activities under these BPAs must be US citizens and have a minimum of a secret security clearance.  The contractor must have several personnel with Top Secret clearances to support requirements that may be awarded.  The place of performance will occur at SMC, its Detachments or the contractor's facility. Contractors must use the SMC/AXC website to obtain a copy of the RFQ and its associated attachments.  Please mail your response to SMC/AXC, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1467, El Segundo, CA, 90245-4659.  No more than one proposal will be accepted from a contractor during any six-month period.

<RESPDATE>072303
<CONTACT>ROGER BRETT 812-854-5269
<DESC>Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division is interested in receiving proposals for improvement of silver-zinc battery technology with respect to performance in areas of life cycle, wet life, overall electrical performance, and process improvements in the manufacturing of silver-zinc batteries.  These improvements would be used to enhance the overall performance and life cycle cost of such systems as NR-1, Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV), DSRV Emergency, Swimmer Delivery Vehicle (SDV) and Advanced Seal Delivery System (ASDS) battery technology.  The proposals can be based on separator technology, plate technology or any other approaches or process improvements the vendors would see as a benefit to the overall silver-zinc battery technology and performance.  This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). It is intended that this BAA be open for a period of six months from the date of publication for Small Businesses.  NSWC Crane encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged business, Hub-zone small business, woman-owned small business, and veteran-owned small business.  Typically each proposal selected may be: (1) funded for periods up to two years subject to the availability of appropriations; (2) funded between $200,000 to $750,000, with the size of each dependent upon the topic (although NSWC Crane reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds); (3) more than one effort may be funded for an individual topic area; (4) NSWC Crane is not interested in concepts that already have been developed or proven (even if they never have been sold before); (5) NSWC Crane seeks proposals for scientific study and experimentation directed  toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding; and (6) deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation rather than focus on a specific system or hardware solution. Proposals for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and would not be considered for funding. In order to minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as a preliminary step, interested parties are strongly encouraged to submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper"). This white paper should not exceed 10 pages, with a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, and a rough cost estimate. Offerors should submit the white papers electronically. The white paper must be accompanied by a title, BAA number, offeror name, project duration, approximate co st, and a brief abstract with information explicitly pertinent to the proposed work. The Government reserves the right to request a proposal from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers. Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such encouragement does not assure a subsequent award. Offerors may submit full technical and cost proposals even if they did not submit a white paper or their white paper was not identified as promising. The Government will acknowledge the receipt of white papers and full technical and cost proposals by e-mail. White papers (and any resulting proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific, technical, and socio-economic merits of the proposed effort;  (2) Potential naval relevance and contributions of the effort to NSWC Crane's specific mission areas; (3) degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to NSWC Crane programs are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered to NSWC Crane with unrestricted (Government Purpose) rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; and (6) realism of the proposed costs and the availability of funds. These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, a nd the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more important than price. Based on evaluation of the white papers, participants may be selected and invited to submit full technical and cost proposals for evaluation by NSWC Crane using the above noted evaluation criteria. An invitation to submit a full proposal does not guarantee funding. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. Any small business may submit a proposal. White papers may be submitted any time prior to expiration of the BAA. There is no set date for submission. The World Wide Web page for NSWC Crane may be accessed for additional information regarding the mission, programs and objectives of the Division at http:\\www.crane.navy.mil.  Please send white papers and proposals via e-mail to Mr. Roger Brett brett_r@crane.navy.mil or mail  to Commander, ATTN: Mr. Roger Brett, Code 1164ER, Building 64, 300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522-5011.

<SUBJECT>D -- SUPPORT FOR NRC''S OPERATIONS CENTER TECHNICAL COMPUTER CODES
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to enter into a sole-source contract entitled "Support for NRC's Operations Center Technical Computer Codes" with Athey Consulting, Inc.  The proposed effort will require the contractor to provide the necessary qualified personnel who are capable of providing technical assistance for applications support for the NRC's Response Computer System (RCS).  The NRC previously contracted with Athey Consulting, Inc. under Contract No. NRC-26-98-262 to develop a computer code entitled "Radiological Assessment System for Consequence Analysis (RASCAL)."  This work included the integration of meteorological and radiological assessment methods and the application of Federal emergency guidance and response plans to severe accidents at commercial nuclear power plants, fuel cycle facilities, and gaseous diffusion plants.  In addition, the previous contract included the development of code documentation and training services.  Under the proposed effort, the contractor shall be required to complete fixes to RASCAL Version 3.0.4, which includes minor fixes to the current Version 3.0.3 and provide major technical improvements to Version 3.1.  As such, the contractor shall provide technical assistance in the planning of recommended software changes/modifications, installation, integration, testing, training and revisions to the associated documentation.  These computer tools will assist the NRC in the event of a serious radiological emergency to aid in assessing plant conditions and potential consequences of radiological accidents.  The required changes/modifications of the technical computer tools, revisions in procedures, and training require a continuous effort by the contractor to ensure reliable performance and effective use of the technical computer tools by the NRC.  It is therefore essential that the incumbent provide the required services as Athey Consulting, Inc. has developed, integrated, installed, tested, and provided training and documentation for the computer tools used within the RCS.  Further, major components of the original specialized software were designed and written by Athey Consulting, Inc. in coordination with other contributing developers.  The authority for negotiating on a sole source basis with Athey Consulting, Inc. is made under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements and the supplies are available from only the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered. The proposed period of performance for this effort is two (2) years from date of award.  The NAICS code is 541511.  The size standard for this requirement  is $21.0 million. This notice is not a request for proposal nor a solicitation for offers.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRC's needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to Brenda J. DuBose, Contract Specialist at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Division of Contracts, Mail Stop T-7-I2, Washington, D.C. 20555 via mail not later than January 31, 2003.  This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  See Note 22****
