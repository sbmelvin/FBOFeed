<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-12-01386 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(13) exceptions:
(i)	 Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold
(ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE.
(iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.
Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail.

Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities and the offerors will be able to respond electronically.

<SUBJECT>Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015

<CONTACT>Joseph S. Gibbs, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-246-6016, Email joseph.gibbs@ed.gov - Sylvia Reid, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-245-6214, Fax 2022456297, Email sylvia.reid@ed.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (the Department) requires a contract to implement U.S. Participation in International Student Assessment (PISA 2015). PISA is an international assessment that focuses on 15-year-olds' performance in reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy every three years. PISA also assesses other subjects, although less frequently, such as general problem-solving and financial literacy. PISA emphasizes functional skills that students have acquired as they near the end of mandatory schooling. PISA is organized by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental organization of industrialized countries. PISA was first administered in 2000. PISA was implemented in 43 countries in 2000, in 41 countries in 2003, 57 countries in 2006, 65 countries in 2009, and 67 countries in 2012. More information on PISA can be found at <a href="http://www.pisa.oecd.org">http://www.pisa.oecd.org</a> and http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa.<br /><br />PISA is steered by the PISA Governing Board (PGB), comprising representatives from the OECD member countries, and implemented internationally by organizations contracted by the OECD. The OECD Secretariat serves as the secretariat for the PGB and has overall managerial responsible for PISA internationally, including overseeing contractors that implement the international activities. The OECD has contracted with multiple organizations (hereafter referred to as the "international consortium" or "international contractors") to carry out PISA 2015 development, implementation, analysis, and overall coordination across countries. In this PWS, all mention of relevant international contractors, organizations, or sponsors refer to these institutions. Each country appoints a National Project Manager (in the United States this is a representative from NCES) to manage the study in the country. The OECD and international contractors provide countries with a series of manuals and technical standards that document the procedures and requirements of the study. <br /><br />PISA 2015 will include assessments of science, reading and mathematics literacy. The science assessment will be based on a new framework and will include some new item development, although it is expected that it will still be possible to report trends in performance. There may also be additional optional subject-matter assessments, such as environmental literacy, financial literacy and/or collaborative problem-solving. Students will complete a questionnaire and schools will complete a questionnaire. <br /><br />PISA has been moving from using only paper-and-pencil assessments to including more computer-based assessments. PISA 2006 included an optional computer-based science assessment, although the United States did not participate in that component. In PISA 2009, PISA administered an optional reading assessment on computer; again, the United States did not participate. In 2012, reading and mathematics were primarily assessed via paper-and-pencil assessment but there were optional computer-based assessments as well and the United States did participate. In 2012, problem-solving was also assessed, only on computer. For PISA 2015, the goal is for computer-based assessments to have an even greater role. It is expected that science, mathematics, and reading will all be available in a computer-based format. Science, mathematics and reading may be administered in some countries in a paper-and-pencil format. However, the United States intends to administer only the computer-based mathematics, reading and science assessments and not the paper-based. Additional optional assessments (see Optional Task 9) may be computer-based or paper-based. To support the transition from paper-based to computer-based format, the PISA 2015 field test will include a study to establish the comparability between the two assessment modes. PISA 2015 may also incorporate some form of computer-adaptive testing.<br />&nbsp;<br />The shift to greater use of computer-based assessments in PISA 2015 has accelerated the international development schedule as well as within-country operations. The first National Project Managers meeting is being held earlier than normal (tentatively scheduled for November 2012); at this meeting, countries will begin to make decisions about sampling plans and receive training in item development and other procedures. The assessment instruments (to which countries are invited to contribute) will be developed and finalized earlier in the cycle than usual in order to ensure that national test delivery systems can be created and finalized in time for the spring 2014 field test; countries are slated to begin adapting field test instruments in June 2013 so national versions of the test delivery system can be finalized in September 2013.<br />

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to award a sole source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract with Lockheed Martin Mission and Sensor Systems (LM MS2). It is anticipated that this contract action will result in Cost Plus Fixed Fee type task orders for the effort required (1) to provide technical, management, and process support necessary to update and maintain MH-60R/S and SH-60B operational software, vendor software, maintenance-related software, and laboratory support software, and software support services for the MH-60R/S and SH-60B Fleet; (2) to perform production software support of the MH-60R/S aircraft for delivery to the fleet; (3) to provide engineering support required for the oversight of Integration, Installation and Checkout (INCO) of ship electronics systems associated with the Multi-Mission Helicopter (MMH) Weapon Systems on newly-constructed AEGIS class destroyers as required by PMA-299; (4) to provide prime technical expertise to Patuxent River, MD H-60 test teams at AIRTEVRON TWO ONE (HX-21) and AIRTEVRON ONE (VX-1) in the conduct of testing, for obsolescent parts and upgrades for new capabilities; and test and evaluation of H-60 software and hardware. This action is being awarded on a sole-source basis to LM MS2 in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements," because LM MS2 is the sole manufacturer of the MH-60R/S helicopter avionics suite, common cockpit and all subsequent changes and improvements to the production aircraft. LM MS2 proprietary data is not for sale and access to the software is integral to the proper and timely accomplishment of the required software support. Therefore, LM MS2 is the only source with the requisite skilled personnel, test equipment, laboratory facilities and proprietary data to perform the required in-depth engineering and programmatic support to design, develop and incorporate avionics efforts onto the H-60 platform in a timely and cost efficient manner. Contractor Name and Address: Lockheed-Martin Mission and Sensor Systems (LM MS2), 1801 State Route 17C, Owego, NY 13827. Questions concerning subcontracting opportunities should be directed to Mr. Luke Mickum at 607-751-7895.

Note:  The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, Rhode Island is NOT accepting quotes or proposals via submission through NECO.

 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

The original manufacturer of the TSDC parts went out of business in 1992 and SEACorp hired the TSDC subject matter experts. As such, the experience, skill set required for timely installation, maintenance, and repair of the Ohio Equipment Replacement TSDC rests solely with SEACorp and its employees. In addition, the Ohio Submarine Class program is the only program using the OER TSDC thereby further limiting available expertise for maintaining these now unique, obsolete components.

The Government anticipates posting the Justification and Approval document with the Request for Proposals.

Under the proposed action, the Contractor shall provide life cycle engineering support for the development, installation, repair, refurbishment and maintenance of the Ohio Class Submarine Data Processing Subsystem (DPS) TRIDENT Signal Data Converter (TSDC) CV-3325B(V)/UYK equipment.
 

Tasks shall consist of operational and maintenance life cycle support, and revision development and advanced planning support.

<DESC><br>This project is 100% Set Aside for Small Business<br><br>Project Description: Construction services include strengthening a 3,380-foot section of the Bradley Canyon levee.  The levee will be strengthened by two methods: installing a steel combi-wall and constructing a soil cement revetment. The new combi-wall will connect to an existing combi-wall and will be installed at the crest of the Bradley Canyon levee along a 1,000-foot section.  The combi-wall consists of king piles and sheet piles.  The king piles and sheet piles will be driven to depths of approximately 64 feet and 52 feet, respectively. The upstream end of the combi-wall will overlap with the downstream end of the soil cement revetment.  The soil cement revetment will be constructed against the existing levee at a slope of 2 horizontal: 1 vertical and have a width of 8 feet.  The soil cement will extend approximately 2,380 feet and will have a vertical height of approximately 30 feet. Approximately 19 feet of the soil cement height will be buried.  A section of the Bradley Canyon levee will be raised with compacted fill by a maximum 1.6 feet.  The existing low flow will be diverted during construction and restored after construction is completed.<br><br>The estimated cost of this project is $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.<br><br>ALL OFFERORS/BIDDERS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS. <br><br>ORDERING SOLICITATION:  The solicitation will be available on-line on or about 24 October 2012.

<a href="mailto:raushanah.m.muhammad@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New England</a>
<DESC>The New England District is acquiring a small business construction contractor to perform the work described under the following project; Stewart's Creek Estuary Restoration. <br><br>The Project is located on Cape Cod in the town of Barnstable, Massachusetts.  The system is connected to Hyannis Harbor (Nantucket Sound) through a 50 foot-long, 3 foot-diameter concrete culvert that passes under Ocean Avenue.  The project involves restoring tidal flushing to the salt pond/marsh system by replacing the existing culvert under Ocean Avenue.  The existing culvert will be replaced with a 4-foot by 6-foot concrete culvert with headwalls and wingwalls.  The downstream side of the culvert will be equipped with a combination sluice gate, which has a flap valve to allow water to leave the upstream area as the tide recedes.  A sedimentation basin (a small depression) will be constructed at the upstream side of the culvert to capture sand transported into the marsh from the beach and an access ramp will be constructed to allow maintenance equipment to access the sedimentation basin.  Work on the culvert will be conducted with an open road cut between September and May.  Downstream flow must be pumped over Ocean Avenue during construction of the culvert.  The restoration area located upstream of the culvert is comprised of a stream fed pond; therefore, a water control plan is required for sediment removal and culvert replacement to be conducted.  Installation of the new culvert requires the relocation of an existing four inch diameter National Grid gas line and the relocation of an existing 12 inch diameter water line.  Gas line relocation work will be a joint effort between National Grid and the Contractor, with National Grid cutting and capping the old line and making the final connection to the new line.  To relocate the water main, the Contractor is required to secure the services of a Town of Hyannis qualified contractor.  There are also utility poles adjacent to the site which will have communication lines in place and operational during the prosecution of the work which shall not be disturbed by the Contractor.  <br>   <br>The estimated construction cost is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.  Work will begin in September 2012 and will extend over a 6-8 month period.  <br><br>Please note this solicitation is set aside for certified small businesses under the applicable NAICS code 237990, size standard of $33.5M. This is not a request for proposals at this time, the solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about June 25, 2012. Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests for hard copies of this solicitation will be accepted. The solicitation will only be available online; in order to download the solicitation offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the New England District. Additional questions may be emailed to the Contract Specialist at raushanah.m.muhammad@usace.army.mil<br><br>

<a href="mailto:kimberly.b.pumyea@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New England</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is soliciting contractors for maintenance dredging at Portsmouth Harbor and Piscataqua River in ME and NH.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990. The project is planned to be issued in on or about 20 August 2012.  The construction window for dredging activities is between December 1, 2012 and March 15, 2013.  The estimated construction cost is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.  Any responsible source meeting this standard may submit a bid to be considered by the New England District.<br><br>The project involves maintenance dredging and advance maintenance dredging to remove a total of about 15,000 cubic yards of sand and gravel from the authorized 35 foot deep channel in the Piscataqua River. The work involves removal of 3 distinct, relatively small shoal areas within the Simplex Reach. Advance maintenance dredging to -40' Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) plus 2' allowable over-depth dredging will be performed on the primary shoal located adjacent to the Tyco Integrated Systems Company wharf (i.e. formerly the Simplex Wire and Cable Co. dock). Maintenance dredging to -35' MLLW plus 2' of allowable over-depth (i.e. 37' below MLLW) will be performed on the other two shoals; one located upstream of the primary shoal and one located downstream of the primary shoal. The dredged material will be placed at a previously-used, in-river disposal area, located about 3,000' seaward of the dredging area. Because of the dynamic nature of the area, it is anticipated that it will be necessary for the contractor to dredge to the allowable depths (i.e. -42' and -37' respectively) to positively clear the required depths of<br>-40' and -35' below MLLW. The dredging window for this work is 1 Dec -15 Mar. Due to uncertain weather conditions and potential ice flows in the river, we are targeting the beginning of the dredging window to complete the work.<br><br>The Piscataqua River has one of the swiftest tidal currents of all of the commercial waterways in the U.S. Tidal currents can exceed 5 knots. Any dredging work is inherently dangerous, but it is especially critical when working during the winter months in relatively deep water, against swift tidal currents and around high vessel traffic that is involved in the transport of hazardous cargos in a densely populated area such as the international port of Portsmouth. The Contractor will be required to conduct the work in such a manner as to not obstruct navigation, and the contractor's plant will be required to be moved on the approach of any vessel to such an extent as may be necessary to afford a practicable passage.<br><br>The solicitation will be available on or about 20 August, 2012 and will be available for downloading by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities website (http:/www.fbo.gov). In order to view this solicitation, prospective contractors are required to self register their firm with Federal Business Opportunities (go to http:/www.fbo.gov and register under Vendor/Citizen). Amendments, if any, to the solicitation will be made available at the http:/www/fbo.gov website. Neither telephonic, mailed nor fax requests will be accepted. Registrants are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the FedBizOps Registration List.

Since that time, numerous small and large companies have expressed interest in this program. This contract will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), C-type contract for a quantiy of one (1)design/fabrication/delivery; Period of Performance of 12 months. It is anticipated that a solicitation will be released within 60 days. No Solicitation document exists at this time.

<p>The Government is performing market research to determine potential sources of engineering design and manufacture of pressure measurement Instrumentation used to measure hydraulic pressure.<br />The Government's objectives and requirements of the potential source are to <br />1. The current pressure instrumentation switches have been in use on this weapon system for close to fifty years and are used to measure the hydraulic pressure in the auxiliary power systems. The pressure switch uses a mechanical design which is open from zero pressure to pressure "A", closed form pressure "A" to pressure "B," and then open at pressures above pressure "B". For the first type of pressure switch, the pressure "A" is approximately 2500 PSI and pressure "B" is approximately 3500 PSI and the switch geometric dimensions are approximately 1" in diameter and 2.5" long. For the second type of pressure switch, the pressure "A" is approximately 1000 PSI and pressure "B" is approximately 1500 PSI and the switch geometric dimensions are approximately .75" in diameter and 1.5" long. <br />2. The original pressure switches used an obsolete technology and are no longer manufactured. We are seeking a form fit and function replacement for the pressure switch with the following requirements.<br />a. Provide Engineering services to design a new pressure switch that would provide the needed switching capabilities and fit inside a case that meets the original drawing dimension requirements. The new switch design can replaces the original mechanical switching mechanism with an electronic switching circuit. <br />b. Build prototypes for developmental testing and perform Pressure, cyclic and vibrational testing on prototypes to verify the prototype design meets specification requirements.<br />c. Using the design that successfully passes the required testing, fabricate 10 of the high pressure and 10 of the low pressure switches. These switches will be used for system level testing that will be performed by the government.<br />d. Government will provide the drawing used to build the original switches along with the requirements for the testing needed to qualify the new design. Hardware to be provided will be two each of the low pressure and two each of the high pressure switches. <br />3. Must be capable of developing special test equipment (the Government does not possess any sort of test equipment) to perform pressure testing, cyclic testing or vibrational testing and all testing will be performed at the contractors facilities.<br />4. All Engineering data and hardware manufactured under this effort shall be considered Air Force property and shall have no license encumbrances <br /><br />The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside.

<DESC>FOR ALL INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT: Ari Herman 443-395-4773 ari.c.herman@mail.mil<br><br>The Government is looking to both gain a better understanding of potential sources to produce Tactical Power Supplies PP-6224D/U and PP-2953E/U, and to better explain to potential sources what the Government's requirements are for the aforementioned Power Supplies. <br><br>***Note: This Sources Sought is a continuation of the efforts from MARKET-SURVRY-5110-9, originally posted on June 16, 2011 and Pre-solicitation W15P7T-12-R-A307 originally posted May 15, 2012*** <br><br>Background Information: <br><br>The PP-6224D/U is a 'Major Item' which means it is allotted to Soldiers on their Modified Table of Organization and Equipment (MTOE). Procurement of these Power Supplies will be used to fill MTOE defined requirements throughout the Army.<br><br>The PP-2953E/U is a 'Secondary Item' which means Soldiers provide funded requisitions to CECOM LCMC to fill their needs. Procurement of these Power Supplies will be to fill field demands.<br><br>Both Tactical Power Supplies share the same performance characteristics and interfaces with their differences being in their associated cabling and their information labels. It is expected that both Power Supplies will share the same production facilities, processes, and components. Both Tactical Power Supplies are considered universal or not tied to any particular system. One of the most common systems for which they are used to support are the vehicular configurations of Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) when used in static locations.<br><br>Technical requirements for these Power Supplies have evolved over the years to incorporate lessons learned, emerging requirements, and to keep current with technological advances. Revision D of MIL-PRF-49080 contains all of the latest requirements information. Some, but not all, of these requirements were incorporated to the current versions of these Power Supplies. W15P7T-12-R-A307 will not be a follow-on contract; previous contract W15P7T-04-D-C021 was for similar items and was awarded to Custom Manufacturing and Engineering, Inc., in September 2004 as a five year, firm-fixed price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity that was extended an additional two years with a Justification and Approval for a sole source award in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source. The ordering period from this former contract ended October 2011.<br><br>After reviewing the selected NAICS, it was determined that this effort is appropriately defined by NAICS 335999. <br><br>The Government is to determine a Small Business is capable of performing this effort. Small Businesses having a NAICS of 335999 are asked to answer the following questions:<br><br>1)	If your company is awarded the contract, will you be able to perform at least 50% of the work required in house?<br>2)	Can your company go without payment for 90 days?<br><br>Please respond in writing by June 1st 2012 by emailing Ari Herman at ari.c.herman.civ@mail.mil<br><br>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no award will be made as a result of this request. This market survey is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). All interested parties are encouraged to respond to the market survey.

<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION</p>
<p>1. Are you familiar with and does your company qualify for any of the programs identified under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19? If yes, please explain.

<p>2. What experience do you have in providing residential Reentry services?</p>
<p>3. Are there any other Residential Reentry Center (RRC) facilities in the area?</p>
<p>4. Are there any state or local ordinances/restrictions that would prohibit or that would considerably slow down the procurement process (i.e. building permits or leasing/rental agreements)?</p>
<p>5. Are there any known local area concerns? Do you think the area would be supportive of a BOP RRC program? Are there any known groups or organizations that would oppose the operation of a residential (halfway) house in this area?</p>
<p>6. Are there environmental issues/concerns in the area?</p>
<p>7. Are there HUBZone locations in the area?</p>
<p>8. Do you feel that it would be difficult to find a suitable location in this area? If so, explain in detail why it would be difficult and provide supporting documentation.</p>
<p>9. What percentage of the work would you do with your firm's employees and what percentage of the work would you subcontract? If subcontracting opportunities are available, do you anticipate any difficulties in subcontracting with 8(a), small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, or women-owned small business concerns?</p>
<p>10. Are there any zoning issues that would prohibit or slow down the procurement process?</p>
<p>11. Is local or public transportation available in this area? If not, is there an alternative method of transportation for inmates to get to and from work or to get to and from their programming appointments?</p>
<p>12. Is the location listed conducive of the BOP requirement for inmates finding jobs within twenty-one (21) calendar days of placement?</p>
<p>13. Are there innovations in this area that the BOP could benefit from and if so, what are they?</p>
<p>14. Are there unique laws or regulations applicable to these services?</p>

<DESC>INDUSTRY DAY/PRE-PROPOSAL CONFERENCE FOR GLEN CANYON POWER PLANT GENERATORS G1, G3, G5, AND G6 REWINDS (ROEBEL DESIGN REBUILDS)
You are invited to attend an Industry Day focused on the Bureau of Reclamation's requirement for the "Glen Canyon Power plant Generators G1, G3, G5, and G6 Rewinds (Roebel Design Rebuilds)."  This event is being hosted by the Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Colorado Region, at the Glen Canyon Dam Power plant in Page, AZ.   Note that a separate Industry Day will be conducted for another Bureau of Reclamation requirement entitled "GSU Transformers and Associated Equipment Replacements" (Reference number R12PS40038) on October 23, 2012.  Search Fedbizopps to find the Industry Day notice for the "GSU Transformers and Associated Equipment Replacements" (Reference number R12PS40038). 
PURPOSE:   To determine project interest and industry capabilities.  This will be a forum for prospective offerors to hear the details of the project by the Glen Canyon Power plant team, both in the form of a presentation and a site visit, and to facilitate a question-and-answer session.   Information gained may be incorporated into the future solicitation or used as a basis for additional research into alternative methods of executing this project.  Participants will be given ample opportunities to talk directly with the Glen Canyon Power plant team during and after the Industry Day.
TARGET AUDIENCE:  Interested and potential offerors including prime contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, and contractors interested in teaming or joint venture arrangements.  All should be aware that two separate Industry Days are being conducted back-to-back for two separate projects (Generator Rebuilds and GSU Transformers and Associated Equipment Replacements) at the same location.  This was done recognizing that potential offerors and interested vendors may have an interest in both projects and therefore could attend on both days without expending time and incurring costs for two separate visits.  It is also believed that it would increase vendor interest and attendance for both projects.  You may request a copy of the draft plans and specifications by following the instructions below under "ADDITIONAL INFORMATION."
WHEN:  Wednesday, October 24, 2012
WHERE:  Carl V. Hayden Visitor's Center Auditorium, Glen Canyon Dam, Page, Arizona
TIME:  0900 - 1600 Arizona Standard Time
REGISTRATION:  Please register for this event by close of business October 12, 2012 by sending an email to kmunro@usbr.gov, Subject:  "Industry Day-R12PS40057-Generator Rebuilds" and include your company name, attendee's names, phone number, email address, and your firm's contractors, manufactures, suppliers size and type of business (e.g. large business, small business, service disabled, HUB zone, 8(a), etc) and bonding capabilities per contract in the body of your email.
SYNOPSIS:  The principal components of the work will involve the following major tasks: 1.  Remove and dispose of existing stator core and armature winding for generators, 2.  Factory test, install and field test new stator core for generators. 3.  Factory test, install and field test new armature windings for generators. 4.  Install and field test new armature windings for 4 generators. 5.  Furnish spare parts for generator armature winding. 6.  Remove, refurbish, re-install and test field poles for generators.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  The Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Colorado Region, anticipates issuing a competitive solicitation for this requirement either late in December 2012, or January 2013.  Whether or not it will be full-and-open competition or subject to some type of set-aside is yet to be determined, depending on the results of this Industry Day and other pending market research.   The estimated magnitude of this construction project is between $50 million and $100 million.   Draft plans and specifications for this project will be made available upon request via email to kmunro@usbr.gov, Subject:  "Request for Draft Plans/Specifications-R12PS40057-Generator Rebuilds-(insert company name making the inquiry)."  The plans and specifications will be made available via a mailed CD/DVD.  
All prospective offerors shall be currently registered in the Central Contractor Registry via www.sam.gov and ensure completed and active Offeror Representations and Certifications for their company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 335311, "Power, Distribution, and Specialty Transformer Manufacturing," with a size standard of 750 employees. 
This Special Notice is being issued to help the Bureau of Reclamation determine the availability and interest of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement.  
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), NOR IS IT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ).  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the requesting party to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this Special Notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this Special Notice.  This FedBizOps Special Notice is strictly for market research.   As a result of this Special Notice, the Government may issue a competitive solicitation; however, should such requirements materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to the Special Notice (e.g. use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement).

<DESC>Program Title:  Army Mobile Instrumented Training System (AMITS)<br><br>Introduction:  The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Program Manager Training Devices (PM TRADE), Product Manager Combat Training Instrumentation Systems (PM CTIS) intends to procure an integrated live Home Station Instrumentation Training System (HITS) training capability with a focus on reduced operational, support, and sustainment costs and implementing a communications architecture that supports future TESS capabilities. <br><br>HITS is the Army program of record and AMITS will be the contract name providing the HITS capability.<br><br>Acquisition Strategy Planning Information (Draft):<br><br>Contract Vehicle:  TBD <br>Contract Type: TBD<br><br>Approximate Funding: $143M, FY13-FY18<br> 	Base award Base award ~ $7M FY13 (1st  Range 8-9 Months ARO)<br> 	FY14  ~ $29M (4 Ranges) <br> 	FY15  ~ $30M (4 Ranges) <br> 	FY16  ~ $30M (4 Ranges)<br> 	FY17  ~ $31M (4 Ranges) <br> 	FY18  ~ $16M (2 Ranges)<br><br>Acquisition Time Estimates: <br> 	Sources Sought Release July 2012, followed up with Industry day<br> 	RFP Release September 2012 <br> 	Contract Award April 2013<br><br><br>Requirement: PM TRADE has a requirement to field a HITS training capability to 21 OCONUS and OCONUS sites over a 5 year period.  Most sites are CONUS but include Hawaii, Alaska, Germany, and Korea.  Additional FMS and support (customer funded) requirements may increase quantity buys.<br><br>Army Mobile Instrumented Training Systems (AMITS) will be fielded at rate of one per quarter beginning in 4Q13 and ending in 4Q18. The AMITS, with existing TESS and future OneTESS, will provide the end-to-end Home Station Training Capability in a mobile configuration. AMITS consists of a mobile instrumentation control center with AAR capability, mobile tower trailers, and a bi directional communications network between the vehicles and soldiers equipped with TESS, and has the capability for Over-The-Air remote configuration management updates to OneTESS/A-TESS type systems.  <br><br>A key objective of the AMITS program will be to reduce the operational support and sustainment costs of a HITS capability.  The integrated mobile shelter will host 4 operators, all network communications equipment, a powered telescoping antenna tower, rack servers, displays, permanent workstation desk/storage area, limited AAR capability, diesel generator, fuel, interior and exterior lighting, HVAC system for environmental extremes, and sound/thermal insulation.  The multi axle commercial shelter and mobile tower trailers will be capable of being towed by a HMMWV or F-250 type truck over semi-improved roads.  The 4 operators will be responsible for setting up, operating, maintaining, and taking down the entire AMITS.<br><br>Additionally, OneTESS indirect fire pairings will rely on AMITS communications to complete player Real Time casualty Assessment (RTCA) pairings and not the MILES laser.  This will require very low latency rates to support RTCA within the time of flight of the indirect fire munitions (mortars, artillery, MK-29, M203/320).   The communications architecture must be capable of supporting up to 2000 live entities (approximately 30% vehicles and 70% dismounts).  Intent is to acquire approximately 1165 player unit radios per fielding site. <br><br>Consolidated configuration management intent is to have it performed at a single location (likely Orlando) and pushed to each of the sites and OneTESS devices to reduce support and sustainment costs and improve configuration management.  <br><br>Follow-on Industry Meetings:  The government intends to release a draft set of technical documents and draft acquisition strategy information under a Sources Sought release in mid to late July.  Approximately 2 weeks later the government will host an Industry Day with one-on-one sessions.  <br><br>Business Collaboration Site on LT2 Portal: An AMITS business collaboration site has been established on the www.lt2portal.org site to help facilitate prime contractor and subcontractor product and capability exposure. New users must register and will be given access to the portal.  Navigate to the collaboration page and click the AMITS link to access the role/product/POC spread sheet.<br><br>RFI: As a part of Market Research, the project team requests interested Prime contractors provide a 1-5 page product summary of existing fielded capabilities currently in use in a military/government operational/training environment supporting the same or similar requirements.  Responses must include evidence of being capable of meeting an 8 month after contract award delivery schedule with no development funding provided.  Please clearly indicate if you are a large or small business.  If a small business, identify other appropriate information for set-aside purposes (8(a), woman-owned, etc).  Additionally, if you are a STOC II contractor in PEO STRI's STOC II IDIQ contracts, please indicate that.<br><br>Prime contractors are encouraged to schedule an initial face to face meeting with Mr. Rob Wolf between 19 June and 3 July to facilitate government market research and provide their RFI response via email to rob.wolf1@us.army.mil.  Written responses should be submitted at least one fill business day prior to the scheduled face-to face. If you are not scheduling an initial meeting please provide your response NLT 28 June.<br><br>POCs:  Technical: Mr. Rob Wolf, 407 384 5233 rob.wolf1@us.army.mil,  Contracts:  Mr. Terry Gotter, 407 380 4338 terry.gotter@us.army.mil <br>

<DESC>The RFP is a Small Business Set-Aside. The North American Industry classification System (NAICS) Code used to define this acquisition is 541720 Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.
<p>The Department of Education (Department) intends to award two contracts in FY 2013 to manage U.S. participation in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015. PISA is an international assessment that focuses on 15-year-olds' performance in reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy every three years. PISA also assesses other subjects, although less frequently, such as general problem-solving and financial literacy. PISA emphasizes functional skills that students have acquired as they near the end of mandatory schooling. The overall goal for the procurement is data collection in the United States for PISA 2015 that meets all international and National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) guidelines and that makes available on a timely basis high-quality internationally comparative assessment data. Furthermore, the study shall result in a report presenting U.S. data and the international comparisons from the perspective of an American constituency. The procurement will also include a validity study to examine the relationship between performance on PISA and educational and workforce outcomes by recruiting students that participate in PISA 2012 and administering a questionnaire in 2015, when those students are 18-years-old. <br />Solicitation ED-IES-12-R-0107 will be conducted as a small business set-aside. The task conducted under this contract is Task 6 - PISA Validation Study which is a cost-reimbursement task. Task 6 correlates with 10 other tasks under a larger contract through solicitation ED-IES-12-R-0081 which will be competed as a Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p><br />It is anticipated that the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) of the U.S. Department of Education will award one contract, with a period of performance of 60 months.</p>
<p>The contract type is anticipated to be cost-reimbursement.</p>
<p>Potential offerors may submit clarification questions no later than October 17, 2012 by 11:00 A.M. Eastern Time (ET). Please review the RFP which includes Section L, Instructions to Offerors and Additional Instructions to Offerors for further information.</p>

<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>WAWF Invoicing Instructions:</p>
<p>The required method for submission of invoices is electronic invoicing with electronic funds transfer (EFT). DFARS Clause 252.232.7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests has been included in the contract which mandates electronic invoicing. If a hard copy invoice is received by Defense Finance and Accounting System (DFAS) it will be rejected back to the vendor for non-compliance with the contract. DFAS requires the use of Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). More information about WAWF is available at https://wawf.eb.mil/ and http://www.dod.mil/dfas/.</p>
<p>Before you can use WAWF, you must self register at : https://wawf.eb.mil/. If your company is new to WAWF, click on "Help with registration" link. To create an invoice in WAWF, you must decide what type of document to create. For this contract the vendor must use the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) with the correct purchase order/contract/delivery order number. If the contract information is available in the system, then WAWF will automatically populate some of the data. If the contract information is not available, WAWF gives a warning message. The warning message allows the vendor to validate that the contract number was entered correctly. If the contract number has been entered correctly and the contract is not found in the system, the vendor should click "OK" and to continue creating the invoice entering the necessary data manually.</p>
<p>Vendors need to have a hard copy of the contract, either form SF 1449 or form DD 1155 before you process your invoice in WAWF. Three DoDAACs must be entered in WAWF. They are the Admin DoDAAC, Ship to DoDAAC (also called the receiving/acceptance point) , and Payment Office DoDAAC. The Issued By DoDAAC and Inspected By DoDAAC fields can be left blank.<br />For your convenience the correct codes are identified below:</p>
<p>Admin DoDAAC = FA7000 (found in Block 9 on the SF1449 or Block 6 on the DD1155)<br />Ship to DoDAAC = FX7000 (found in Block 15 on the SF1449 or Block 14 on the DD1155)<br />Payment DoDAAC = F67100 (Found in Block 18a on the SF1449 or Block 15 on the DD1155)</p>
<p>Besides the DoDAACs, you must also enter the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN). This is a four to six digit number such as 0001 or 0001AA. It is important to enter the correct CLIN with the associated dollar amount. Some contracts have more than one CLIN, so each CLIN must be entered.<br /><br />The vendor may use a system called "My Invoice" to see if the invoice payment has been scheduled. The web address is https://myinvoice.csd.disa.mil//index.html. Payment information is loaded under the DUNS number.</p>
<p>For more information about WAWF, go to the Web-Based Training Website http://wawftraining.com. Also, the WAWF Vendor Getting Started Guide may be helpful. If you have questions about WAWF, please contact the Help Desk at (866) 618-5988 or (801) 605-7095 or email: cscassig@csd.disa.mil.</p>

POC: SFC Zahnley,Jason 760-360-3693. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>In accordance with DFARS 252.232-7003, "Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports", the contractor shall submit their payment request electronically using the WAWF.

POC: SFC Zahnley, Jason (760) 360-3693. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>The Government will not be responsible for returning equipment with a full tank of gas or paying to refuel the equipment at the end of the Period of Performance. DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), US Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112 , Washington, D.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), to ensure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies. OPS performs these functions through several teams, namely, the Operations Support Team, the Overseas Administration Team, the Field Support Team and the Military Liaison Team (MLT). The MLT provides technical assistance and guidance, military liaison and consequence management of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear or Explosive (CBRNE) events. It also provides overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and to other sectors necessary to ensure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies. The Military Liaison Unit (MLU) is part of MLT and manages OPS liaison with the U.S. Military.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Program areas of common interest between USAID and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) include, but are not limited to, humanitarian assistance (disaster response), counter-terrorism, strategic communications, conflict prevention and mitigation, counter-insurgency, post-conflict reconstruction and stabilization, resiliency, and transformational development. To ensure cohesion among policy goals and operational execution, USAID assigns Senior Development Advisors (SDAs) and OFDA Humanitarian Assistance Advisors/Military (HAA/Ms) to the DoD Geographic Combatant Commands (GCCs), U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the Pentagon.</p>
<p>The USAID SDA serves as the principal USAID officer to the relevant Combatant Command (COCOM) and to the Pentagon, supporting the full spectrum of policies and activities across USAID's regional and functional bureaus and enabling and empowering the USAID perspective and operational priorities within DoD. The OFDA HAA/M has the lead on coordinating disaster response activities for USAID within the COCOM area of responsibility and to the Pentagon and reports directly to the OFDA Director.</p>
<p>In all areas of activity, the SDA and HAA/M closely collaborate on their messaging to and activities with the GCCs, including sharing information and back-filling one another as necessary. It is also a joint responsibility of the SDA and the HAA/M to keep one another informed of the other's activities. The OFDA and Office of Civilian-Military Cooperation (CMC) Directors, through OFDA's MLT Leader and the CMC Plans Division Chief, prioritize and monitor close collaboration and coordination between their respective offices. At all points, policy and operational guidance is coordinated with broader technical guidance from the relevant USAID bureau, office, and/or team.</p>
<p>The MLT Leader serves as OFDA's principal point of contact to coordinate with DoD on foreign disaster response and humanitarian assistance operations. In addition to coordinating the on-going activities of the MLT staff, the MLT Leader will also ensure that OFDA has sufficient coverage for DART deployments and RMT activations and oversee the portfolio for CBRNE disaster planning and preparedness.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of an MLT Leader to be responsible for civil-military coordination for international disaster response and humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The incumbent's duties and responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as liaison from USAID/OFDA to DoD in an effort to help the military coordinate international disaster response as part of a comprehensive USG response and within the broader humanitarian community so as to achieve the best use of military assets, including reducing redundant or counter-productive military activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the military in defining and reconciling its role with that of the other members of both the USG and the humanitarian relief community;</p>
<p>&bull; Seek out methods to most effectively utilize DoD's unique capacities and strengths in foreign disaster response, planning, and risk reduction; develop and maintain systems through which DoD can coordinate its operations with USAID during foreign disaster response operations;</p>

Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); NGOs; and other USAID offices, including USAID/CMC;</p>
<p>&bull; Support OFDA senior management in defining a strategy for military coordination, to include guidance for determining USAID/OFDA participation in DoD operations, operational direction for responding to specific requests, and assistance in determining how and where USAID/OFDA should request activities and participation;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide USAID/OFDA briefing and training to uniformed military officers and enlisted personnel as well as DoD civilians and contractors at various DoD educational institutions (service war colleges, National Defense University, Navy Postgraduate School, etc.) and supervision of civil-military training such as the Joint Humanitarian Operations Course, including overarching control of curriculum and teaching methodology;</p>

As supervisor, plan and assign work effectively and fairly; set realistic but challenging work goals; provide necessary resources, guidance, and training; counsel or evaluate personnel in their rating scheme; and recommend and take corrective action when necessary;</p>
<p>&bull; Be a resource for USAID/OFDA on working with the U.S. Military, including assisting in the identification of opportunities for DoD and USAID/OFDA staff and programs to cooperate in disaster response, preparedness and risk reduction activities and providing expert analysis and advice to high-level officials on complex program issues on international disaster response;</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. Disseminate in accordance with provisions of DoD Directive 5230.25. This also applies to distribution of the TDP to all SUBCONTRACTORS at every level. To be eligible to gain access to export controlled TDP you must have a current DD 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement certification on file with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS).

Upon completion of the purposes for which Government Technical Data has been provided, the Contractor is required to destroy all documents, including all reproductions, duplications, or copies thereof as may have been further distributed by the Contractor. Destruction of this technical data shall be accomplished by: shredding, pulping, burning, or melting any physical copies of the TDP and/or deletion or removal of downloaded TDP files from computer drives and electronic devices, and any copies of those files.<br>W52H1B222001T3<br><br>(vii) Delivery Date:  14 days ADC<br>Acceptance: Destination.<br>FOB: Destination to Rock Island, IL 61299<br><br>(viii) FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.<br><br>(ix) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items.  All offerors must carefully review the delivery requirement in the request for quote or solicitation. When submitting an offer/bid, please ensure that you can meet the delivery schedule. <br><br>On time delivery is very critical. Therefore, offerors must adhere to the delivery requirements indicated in any resultant award. Failure to comply with the contractual delivery schedule, may result in termination of the order or require consideration if the government elects to extend delivery. The Government is not required to extend your delivery schedule if you encounter delays. The non-availability of raw materials, subcontractor issues, scheduling conflicts, etc., should be considered at the time you are submitting your offer/bid. They are not acceptable excuses for failing to meet the delivery after award.  <br><br>Ensuring that you can provide quality products that conform to the contract is just as important as meeting the required delivery schedule. Delivery of non-conforming products results in delivery delays and increased costs to the Government. <br><br>Please note that if you receive this award, your performance under this contract (including timeliness of deliveries and the quality of supplies/services delivered) will be monitored and recorded by this contracting office.  This information may be used to determine a record of past performance for future contract awards.  Contractors/offerors that are concerned about their record of past performance may contact this office if they wish to view and discuss their records.<br><br>EVALUATION OF AWARD <br><br>(1) Price:  The Government will evaluate quotes based on prices quoted in the paragraph (v) of this solicitation.  <br><br>(2) Past Performance:  This factor will be based on information obtained from any sources available to the JMTC Contracting Office, including the PD2 Vendor Performance Database for the JMTC Contracting Office, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System- Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR) and other records maintained by the JMTC Contracting Office or other agencies.  Data maintained by this contracting office may include an offeror's record of performance on previous contracts issued by this contracting office.  Quotes received from vendors with no past performance history information will be evaluated based on information obtained from various sources, such as contracting agency experience with the contractor, previous contract history available from DCMA, etc. The Government does not intend to discuss any negative Past Performance data with offerors, if that data is contained in the JMTC contracting office's own records on past contract performance, or PPIRS-SR database.  <br><br>The Government intends to make a single award to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, based on an integrated analysis of each offeror's Past Performance and Price.  The final award decision will be a trade-off between Past Performance and price, with the Past Performance factor being more important than price.<br><br>The Government will develop a Past Performance rating for each offeror, based on the Past Performance information described above.  This may include numerically-generated scores (such as PPIRS-SR), narrative information contained in this contracting office's own databases, or descriptions provided by references.  The contracting officer will analyze this information and develop an adjectival rating, going from "Low Risk" to "Medium Risk" and finally "High Risk".  Offerors who have no past performance information will be assigned a "Neutral Risk" rating.<br><br>The contracting officer will perform a trade-off analysis based on the assigned Past Performance rating and price for each proposal.  In determining the best value to the Government, award may be made to other than the lowest-priced proposal.  While the Past Performance factor is more important than price, the price factor may become controlling as Past Performance ratings tend to equalize.  <br><br>INSTRUCTIONS FOR QUOTE SUBMISSION<br><br>The Government intends to make an award based on a best value basis.  This process will involve a trade-off analysis, if applicable, between Price and Performance Risk.  This may result in award to other than the low quote and/or other than the highest rated (best performance risk) quote.  <br><br>For the evaluation of Performance Risk, the Government will obtain information from the any sources available to the JMTC Contracting Office, including the PD2 Vendor Performance Database for the JMTC Contracting Office, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System- Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR) and other records maintained by the JMTC Contracting Office or other agencies. You are not required to submit any additional information on Performance Risk.  The Government does not intend to discuss performance risk information with the offerors.<br><br>FAR 30.202-1(a) DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FORM<br> <br>Disclosure Statement, Form CASB-DS-1, is not included in this solicitation<br>package. Any offeror meeting the criteria for concurrent submission of the<br>Disclosure Statement, who has not previously received the form from another Government source, will immediately contact the cognizant ACO (See DOD Directory of Contract Administration Components (DOD 4105.59H)) to obtain a copy of the form. If the form is not promptly made available by the ACO, the offeror will immediately so advise the PCO, who will provide one copy of the form.

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>The Government will not be responsible for returning equipment with a full tank of gas or paying to refuel the equipment at the end of the Period of Performance. DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>

<DESC>1.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for hotel rooms, meeting rooms and meals, in support of North Dakota National Guard Yellow Ribbon, prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with Request for Quote and Statement of Objective included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation, W901UZ-12-1004, is being issued as a request for quote. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-58.  The contractor shall provide all plant, labor, materials, and transportation necessary to provide hotel rooms, meeting rooms and meals to North Dakota National Guard soldiers and families, 27-28 April, 2013 in Fargo/Grand Forks, ND as specified in the attached Request for Quote.  The various dates and numbers of hotel rooms, meeting room requirements and meals required are specified on the attached Request for Quote. <br><br>2.  Third party offerors shall include the additional information requested in the following lettered paragraphs (a through c).  Failure to provide this information with any quote may deem the quote to be technically unacceptable and/or non-responsive.  For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a caterer, the offeror must provide the following:<br>a. A separate document describing the technical approach for the offerors services as a prime contractor.  The technical approach must state that a representative from the third party will be available full-time during the inclusive dates of the requirement.  The technical approach must include the third party representative's name and contact information; and<br>b. A copy of a signed written agreement between the third party offeror and hotel/food service vendor (who has the authority of the hotel/food service vendor) which states that the third party has been given the authority to propose a quote for the stated hotel/food service vendor.  The agreement must state the required period of performance and that the caterer has the ability to perform for the stated period of performance.  This agreement must not be dated before the date of this solicitation and no later than the offer due date; and<br>c. A copy of all insurance(s) (standard business, liability, extraordinary insurances) must be submitted with the offerors technical proposal for evaluation purposes.<br><br>3.  The provisions at 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items apply. Only one quote per offeror will be considered.  The Government will award to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government (price and other factors considered).  This may result in award to other than the lowest offer received.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: price, availability of rooms, and proposed menu. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. Additional requirements apply to third-party offerors; these requirements are contained elsewhere in this solicitation.  The Contracting Officer will evaluate offers on the basis of information furnished by the quote or identified in the quote and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the quote.  Offerors are advised that the hotel rooms will not be paid for as part of any contract awarded-- the hotel rooms are part of the total requirement for the event but will be paid for by the individual soldiers or their respective units; the cost of the hotel rooms will be part of the evaluation criteria for the overall cost of the event.  All hotel rooms, meeting rooms and meals should be located at a single venue.  If a single venue cannot accommodate for all the rooms, then two additional venues may be added.  This will be for just additional rooms only, and need to be in close proximity to the main venue.  The other venues must also include indoor pools.  All service fees and gratuities will be included in the cost of the meals. The anticipated award will be a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) type contract.  Offerors must submit quotes on the full quantity identified.  Award shall be made to a single offeror.  The Government reserves the right to make no award under this procedure.  Offerors shall utilize the attached RFQ document to submit their offer.  All late quotes will be rejected. The government reserves the right to make no award resulting from this RFQ. <br><br>4.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer) whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  The Government may make additions or deletions to the number of meals and/or hotel rooms required during the contract period, and will provide a 72-hour notice to the contractor; the Government will not be liable for any hotel rooms and/or meals cancelled at least 72 hours prior to the stated need.<br><br>5.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS <br />Minuteman III Pendulous Integrating Gyroscopic Accelerometer (PIGA) Float NSN: 1420-01-386-7795 AH <br />This request is an announcement for information/market research for planning purposes. The synopsis does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, invitation for bid nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. <br />1.0 SUBJECT: Sources sought for the repair of the float sub-assembly used in the Pendulous Integrating Gyroscopic Accelerometer (PIGA) instrument for the Minuteman III guidance system. This repair supports the AFNWC/NI, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) which is responsible for the ICBM missile guidance set. <br />2.0 DESCRIPTION: Honeywell DSES-Space, Clearwater, Florida (CAGE Code 09128) is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and the only qualified source of repair for the PIGA Float since 1975. Honeywell is the only known source that currently has the capital-owned support equipment, high tech facilities, and proprietary data necessary to manufacture and repair the PIGA Float. The PIGA float consists of parts made of I400 Beryllium which is hazardous and requires specialized equipment, handling procedures and stringent safety requirements. Some of the Beryllium components are coated with aluminum oxide using a plasma powder spray and finished to tolerances within millionths of an inch. Every part of the float requires precision machining, a tremendous amount of attention to detail, and specialized skills to successfully produce. Within the PIGA Float Assembly is the Gas Bearing Wheel, the critical component of the float assembly and the heart of the PIGA. The Gas Bearing Wheel assembly is the size of a thimble yet its manufacturer requires more than 200 critical machining operations and ultra-precise mechanical measurements. Pyroceram glass and ferrite ceramic material are also used in the PIGA float. These materials are very fragile and also require unique manufacturing and finishing processes. In addition to the repair of PIGA floats, this effort includes maintaining peculiar support equipment, which is Government Furnished Property (GFP) as necessary. <br />To become a qualified source the entity must have access to I400 Beryllium, pyroceram, Astro lube, and MN60L ferrite material to demonstrate capabilities to produce PIGA floats. The Air Force has a limited amount of I400 Beryllium and cannot provide this material to vendors for testing and qualification purposes. If interested in becoming a qualified source please contact Nathan.Donahue@hill.af.mil for Source Qualification Procedures. <br />THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPORSALS (RFP). Firms responding to this announcement should include company name, cage code, point of contact, address and indicate whether they are a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUB Zone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business. Potential offerors should submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) that addresses the offerors ability to provide the above requested unit. The Government reserves the right to set-aside any subsequent acquisition based upon known sources and/or responses to this synopsis. <br />SOCs may be submitted by facsimile at 801-775-2116; e-mail: dustin.huler@hill.af.mil; or mailed to 6014 Dogwood Ave, Bldg 1258, rm 26 Hill AFB UT 84056-5816, Attention: Dustin Huler. Responses must be received not later than close of business (COB) 4:00 pm mst&nbsp;24 October 2012. Identify your response with the corresponding Program Title: Sources Sought: PIGA Float.

<a href="mailto:jecarter@blm.gov">jecarter@blm.gov</a>
<DESC>CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT WALKING BOX: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has completed the contract documents (plans and specifications) and will be soliciting construction proposals for the adaptive reuse/redevelopment of an historic resource known as Walking Box Ranch, as well as, the new construction of a small research and learning campus on site.
The ranch is located west of Searchlight, Nevada, just south of Highway 164.  The project involves the sensitive adaptation of the resource to accommodate public visitation while maintaining the historic integrity of the site and structures.   Another separate, yet integral, element of this undertaking is the development of a field research facility to be operated by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) on a portion of the site outside of the designated historic zone.  Interpretive exhibits will be concentrated in areas open to the visiting public.  Utilities and infrastructure will need to be developed.  The development involves 40 acres in the northwest quadrant of a larger 120-acre, protected parcel.  Sensitive treatment of the developed area and methods to control impact upon the adjacent protect areas is part of this undertaking.
The project consists of, but is not limited to, the stabilization, rehabilitation, and preservation of the following (note: all square footages (sf) listed are approximate): 1. Installation of a rock garden to its historic context; 2. Selective demolition and the historic preservation of a 5000 sf ranch house 3. The rehabilitation of a 1500 sf existing bunkhouse and the addition of approx. 600 sf to create a new 2100 sf administration building; 4. The preservation of a 2100 sf barn; 5. The stabilization of a 120 sf ice house.
The project also consists of, but is not limited to, the new construction of (note: all square footages (sf) listed are approximate): 1. Extensive site improvement work (grading, vehicular and pedestrian hardscape, utilities and infrastructure, fencing, tortoise habitat fencing, landscape, etc.) of the 40 acre site; 2. A 4300 sf research, classroom, lab facility; 3. A 7700 sf bunkhouse with kitchen facility; 4. A 300 sf campground pavilion; 5. A 1200 sf caretaker residence and garage structure; 6. A 900 sf maintenance facility; 7. A 120 sf blacksmith shop.
This is an educational facility dealing with environmental themes.  It is therefore essential that this undertaking be constructed using sustainable practices.  The project must be registered for certification under a nationally recognized green rating system.  Criteria for evaluating the success of having achieved a sustainable development will be guidance from a rating system such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Green Globes, or equal.
The construction magnitude is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.

Extensive site improvement work (grading, vehicular and pedestrian hardscape, utilities and infrastructure, fencing, tortoise habitat fencing, landscape, etc.) of the 40 acre site; 2. A 4300 sf research, classroom, lab facility; 3. A 7700 sf bunkhouse with kitchen facility; 4. A 300 sf campground pavilion; 5. A 1200 sf caretaker residence and garage structure; 6. A 900 sf maintenance facility; 7. A 120 sf blacksmith shop.
This is an educational facility dealing with environmental themes.  It is therefore essential that this undertaking be constructed using sustainable practices.  The project must be registered for certification under a nationally recognized green rating system.  Criteria for evaluating the success of having achieved a sustainable development will be guidance from a rating system such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Green Globes, or equal.
The construction magnitude is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.

<p>The Department of Education (Department) intends to award two contracts in FY 2013 to manage U.S. participation in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015. PISA is an international assessment that focuses on 15-year-olds' performance in reading literacy, mathematics literacy, and science literacy every three years. PISA also assesses other subjects, although less frequently, such as general problem-solving and financial literacy. PISA emphasizes functional skills that students have acquired as they near the end of mandatory schooling. The overall goal for the procurement is data collection in the United States for PISA 2015 that meets all international and National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) guidelines and that makes available on a timely basis high-quality internationally comparative assessment data. Furthermore, the study shall result in a report presenting U.S. data and the international comparisons from the perspective of an American constituency. The procurement will also include a validity study to examine the relationship between performance on PISA and educational and workforce outcomes by recruiting students that participate in PISA 2012 and administering a questionnaire in 2015, when those students are 18-years-old.</p>
<p>Solicitation ED-IES-12-R-0081, will be conducted through full and open competition. There are 10 tasks in total under this solicitation (5 core and 5 optional). Solicitation ED-IES-12-R-0107 will be conducted as a small business set-aside. The task conducted under this contract is Task 6 - PISA Validation Study which is a cost-reimbursement task. Task 6 correlates with 10 other tasks under a larger contract through solicitation ED-IES-12-R-0081. In total, there are 11 tasks (6 core and 5 optional).</p>
<p><br />It is anticipated that the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) of the U.S. Department of Education will award one contract, with a period of performance of 60 months.</p>
<p>The contract type is anticipated to be a hybrid which include both cost reimbursement tasks and fixed price tasks.</p>
<p>Potential offerors may submit clarification questions no later than October 17, 2012 by 11:00 A.M. Eastern Time (ET). Please review the RFP which includes Section L, Instructions to Offerors and Additional Instructions to Offerors for further information.</p>

<DESC>Introduction<br />The purpose of this amendment is to correct the contract number&nbsp;referenced in the original sources sought notice dated 9/27/12. Under the "Background" statement, 2nd paragraph, the contract number of the current contract should read "HHSN272200700002C."&nbsp;The due date for submission of capability statments remains unchanged.<br /><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br />&nbsp;
<p>Background<br />The Division of AIDS (DAIDS) supports a comprehensive portfolio of contract resources to discover and develop novel therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of infections caused by HIV-1, AIDS-associated opportunistic pathogens, and other infectious agents. Animal model resources constitute one element of this drug discovery and development program. DAIDS initiates the preclinical evaluations of the efficacy and tolerability of novel HIV therapeutics and selects the agents to be tested. The current contract will expire in December, 2013. The purpose of this solicitation is to re-compete the existing contract for small animal models that can be used to evaluate potential therapeutics for HIV-1 infection. The term of the new award will be seven years.</p>
<p>The current contract was awarded in 2006 and will expire in December, 2013. The current contract is with the University of California, San Francisco (contract number HHSN272200700002C). The animal model being used is an immunodeficient mouse engrafted with human fetal thymus and liver (SCID-hu Thy/Liv) and infected with well-characterized isolates of HIV-1. The types of agents tested over the last six years include synthetic and natural compounds as well as biologics.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives <br />Experience with the SCID-hu Thy/Liv model has demonstrated its suitability for the evaluation of potential HIV-1 therapeutics. It is tissue-based, as is HIV-1 infection, and uses HIV-1 as the viral target. In addition, a second mouse model is being solicited. The second mouse model will consist of immunodeficient mice engrafted with human fetal thymus and liver tissue and other cells and/or tissues, such that the model (or mice) has the following characteristics:, reconstitutes gut-associated lymphoid tissue, develops viremia and disseminated infection in engrafted human tissue. Such engrafted, infected mice should be capable of supporting longitudinal studies of infection. Therefore, the present solicitation is for the SCID-hu Thy/Liv model and for an additional mouse model.</p>
<p>The scope and intent of the contract for the Humanized Mouse Models for HIV Therapeutics Development is to enable the NIAID to conduct studies in a predictive small-animal model to advance the development of novel therapies for HIV-1 disease. The model will employ state-of-the-art techniques and technologies in evaluating promising AIDS therapies for HIV/AIDS in a predictive small-animal model and will incorporate new and improved techniques and technologies into the studies conducted throughout the contract period.</p>
<p>Project Requirements<br />The offeror must demonstrate the ability to evaluate potential HIV-1 therapeutics, alone and in combination, for efficacy and toxicity in vivo, in a validated animal model consisting of SCID mice engrafted with human fetal thymus (SCID-hu Thy/Liv) and liver tissue and infected with a diverse panel of well characterized primary isolates and molecular clones of HIV-1 and in a second engrafted immunodeficient mouse model as described above. Up to 600 SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice (50 mice per experiment) and 60 unengrafted SCID mice will be needed for evaluations of single and combination therapies per year. The offeror shall be capable of providing up to 50 SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice per month, in a single group engrafted with tissue from a single donor. In the second mouse model, up to 400 engrafted immunodeficient mice (40 mice per experiment) and 50 unengrafted mice shall be needed for evaluations of single and combination therapies per year. The Contractor shall be capable of providing one cohort of up to 40 mice per month, engrafted with tissue from a single donor. The in vivo systems shall be available for efficacy and toxicity testing at the time of award. Furthermore, the offeror should demonstrate appropriate prior personal experience of the PI and/or team members using the mouse models, i.e. performing evaluations of antiviral compounds, immune-based or other therapies; conducting pharmacologic and toxicological studies; modifying models or developing new models; and conducting basic research on the immunopathogenesis of HIV-1.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance<br />It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, level-of-effort (term) type contract will be awarded. The period of performance will be for a one (1) year (Base Period) plus six (6) one year options (terms), for a total possible performance period of seven (7) years, beginning on or about December 6, 2013. The requirement will be for the delivery of 6.00 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the Base Period (Year 1) and each option period (Years 2 through 7).</p>
<p>Capability Statement/Information Sought<br />Capability Statements should clearly convey information regarding the respondent's capabilities, including: (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information.</p>
<p>Interested contractors must submit a capability statement (five page limitation, excluding resumes) describing their company's experience and ability to perform this effort which includes the following: (1) a summary list of similar work previously performed; (2) the professional qualifications and specific experience of staff who may be assigned to the requirement; (3) resumes for proposed key personnel, including the Principal Investigator/co-PI, which reflect education, and previous work relevant to the proposed requirement; (4) a general description of the facilities and other resources needed to perform the work; and (5) demonstrated ability to carry out the work.</p>
<p>Each response should include the following Business Information:</p>
<p>a. DUNS<br />b. Company Name<br />c. Company Address<br />d.

All offerors must be registered in CCR which is located at http://www.ccr.gov/</p>
<p>Teaming Arrangements: All teaming arrangements should also include the above-cited information and certification for each entity on the proposed team. Teaming arrangements are encouraged.</p>
<p>NIAID recognizes that no single organization or institution may have the expertise and facilities required to perform all of the tasks mentioned above. Therefore, the Contractor may need to utilize the expertise and resources of subcontractors and specialized consultants to provide the full spectrum of requested activities. The Contractor shall be responsible for ALL work performed under this contract including that performed by any subcontractors and consultants. The Contractor will ensure that any and all processes meet international, federal, local and state regulations to ensure the continuity and validity of the resulting product.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to the synopsis is to revise the anticipated release of the solicitation to July 2012 and to correct the total anticipated quantity. The sunopsis is re-stated below:

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) intends to conduct a competitive procurement for a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for the production of up to 1,000,000 Battlefield Dosimeters.  The current Navy Battlefield Dosimeter is the IM-270/PD. The IM-270/PD is a battery-powered, self- indicating device.  The shelf life of the IM-270/PD is nearing its end, due to the battery life. For this reason and in support of the next Battlefield Dosimeter, BUMED, through the Naval Dosimetry Center (NDC), has requested NAVSEA 04RN to commence the procurement of a Battlefield Dosimetry system that would meet the requirements for a Battlefield Dosimeter and also function as a dosimeter for Operations Other than War (OOTW).
  The intended period of performance is from the date of award through four (4) years thereafter.  The detailed requirements will be provided in the solicitation to be issued in July 2012.

<DESC>This award was competed under the GSA's Federal Supply Schedule 874, Mission Oriented Business Integrated Service (MOBIS), SIN 1, Consulting Services Contract.&nbsp; A Time &amp; Materials task order was awarded because offerors' proposed best efforts to accomplish the projected contract requirements would be subject to fluctuation based on uncertain available funding for optional positions and cost for the actual requirements.&nbsp; Thus, the uncertain funding and nonquantifiable requirements prohibited the use of a firm-fixed price task order.&nbsp; The use of a T&amp;M task order was determined to be in the best interest of the Government.

<DESC>To provide non-personal services necessary to perform the following:
<p>The objective of this requirement is for a follow-on effort of the Design, Construction, &amp; Physical Security<br />Analytical Support for the BRAC Program Office (BPO). The support program provides an in-depth analysis of the<br />technical remediation and modification requirements to efficiently and effectively enhance the protection of<br />Department of Defense (DOD) assets and security interests within the Fort Belvoir Mark Center Campus facility.<br />The support program is also responsible for validating the planning, design and construction management services<br />administered by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to ensure all operational, physical security<br />and life safety requirements are executed, as required by the BRAC 133 contractual obligations. The responsibilities<br />of the support program includes, but is not limited to: requirements gathering; program planning; design, cost and<br />schedule analysis; deficiency reports; coordination with building tenants for access into restricted areas; and other<br />support activities as the building owners' representative.</p>
<p>The Mark Center was designed and constructed for WHS under a contract awarded and administered by USACE.<br />Since tenant occupancy and use of the Fort Belvoir Mark Center Campus facility, it has become apparent that<br />several operational requirements were not identified or anticipated during the initial design phase. This included the<br />need for dedicated access to telecommunication rooms (TRs) and electrical rooms (ERs), and the application of<br />Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)-compliant door closures on access/egress to tenant spaces. Additionally,<br />construction of the framing and surrounding walls for the physical security-compliant doors, the fire egress doors,<br />and the exterior entry &amp; egress doors have been found to be inadequate to support the required physical security<br />hardware and door specifications. Substantial latent defects must be addressed. Thus, an unplanned remediation<br />project to address the structural and physical security failures is required to ensure physical security and life safety<br />standards for entry and egress are maintained, and that the security of classified spaces is not compromised. All<br />three activities will ensure classified infrastructure protection, enhance force protection, and life-safety egress<br />requirements are met. USACE is primarily responsible for designing and implementing the changes necessary to<br />enhance physical security at the Mark Center.</p>
<p>The support program under this requirement will continue to provide WHS security oversight management on behalf<br />of the tenant security managers for any physical construction in secure spaces and oversight of all other construction<br />to ensure physical security requirements are achieved. By providing oversight management support, the program<br />will ensure that the design intent of operational flexibility within the Mark Center Building is achieved, by allowing<br />for easy accreditation or certification of non-secure space at any time in the future.</p>
