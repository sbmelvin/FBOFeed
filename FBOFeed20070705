Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Fujitsu FI-5220C Scanner.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the Fujitsu FI-5220C scanner to support general office use such as scanning passports, to support VOIS, and to replace the scanners used by CA/EX and CA/VO/I.  The Fujitsu Fi-5220C is a high-speed color capable scanner with top speed of 40 sheets per minute or 80 (when scanning both sides of each sheet) page images per minute.   It operates at approximately twice the speed of the previously reviewed FI-4220C.  The product complies and is able to operate within Consular Affairs (CA) Modernized Systems architecture.  This scanner meets specific requirements for CA applications.   In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Fujitsu FI-5220C scanner.<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The choice to use the FI-5220C as opposed to other document scanners available is that CA/CST/CS has acquired and fielded several hundred of these scanners since its inception in 2002.  The FI-5220C offers more features and is more robust than other scanners in this price range.  The continued use of Fujitsu scanners obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple scanners.  Furthermore, no additional training to those handling the scanner is necessary with the continued use of this scanner.   In addition, the document scanners require customized software.  Because the proprietary Consular applications (NIV, IVO, ACS+, and INK) have been developed to work with this specific document scanner, it is most cost effective to continue to use the Fujitsu FI-5220C rather than introduce another manufacturer’s product.  Another manufacturer’s product will require redesigning the CA applications.   CA/CST has selected the Fujitsu FI-5220C scanner because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.   The Fujitsu FI-5220C scanner has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The server has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>TO HAVE A BID CONSIDERED FOR AWARD ALL VENDORS MUST PROVIDE MANUFACTURER, PART # AND EXTENDED SPECIFICATIONS OF THE EXACT MODEL BEING PROPOSED FOR ALL LINE ITEMS. NO EXEPTIONS. FAILURE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION WILL RESULT IN A 'NON RESPONSIVE' BID AND REMOVAL FROM AWARD CONSIDERATION.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to implement recently developed sialoglycan chemistry in order to develop automated assays to measure antibodies to influenza viruses, including pandemic influenza viruses.  Current technology utilizes Red Blood Cells (RBC) in a hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay that requires manual readout. Therefore, CDC plans to acquire sialoglycan-coated beads and plates to develop a methodology to be used as a surrogate of RBC with long shelf life which is compatible with automated multiwell plate readers.  CDC will also include options to purchase a supply of essential test kits for a period of three years in order to perform antibody measurements by this approach.  This technology is expected to make it possible to study antibody responses to seasonal and emerging influenza viruses with greater speed and accuracy.  The contractor shall provide the necessary supplies and services to develop fluorescent and/or magnetic beads, quantum dots, or multiwell plates coated with sialoglycans from up to six animal sources for performing influenza virus antibody binding assays.  The solicitation is available for downloading July 6, 2007.

San Diego, CA
Project No. 5CA0252

The United States Government is conducting a competition for 3,310 rentable square feet of alternative office and related space and will relocate if a consideration of the economics involved and other factors are supportive.  The BOMA/ANSI Office Area Square Footage must yield a minimum of 2,878 to 3,020 square feet of contiguous office and related space with 6 structured parking spaces in the City of San Diego, California for use by the OPM for personnel, furnishings, and equipment.  The cost of relocation including the replacement of furniture, telecommunications, tenant improvements, and above standard alterations as well as agency mission and other factors will be considered.

The space must be in an office building and section of the city that is professional and prestigious in appearance, well-maintained and of modern design and/or tastefully rehabilitated to modern use with access to public transportation.

<DESC>The US Fish & Wildlife service, Region 7, Anchorage, Alaska, an agency within the US Dept of the Interior  plans to modify an award, 701817M055 for commercial items (fuel & parts) which will increase the award over $25,000.00 IAW Far Part 5.203 (b).  The current Purchase Order was done as a sole source procurement to Shoreside Petroleum Inc., Whittier, Alaska for unleaded Gasoline, motor oil and small outboard motor parts (spark plugs, filters etc).  With this additional $10,000.00 it will make a new total of $30,475.00.  This cost increase was unanticipated but due to the number of projects added and assigned to our Region 7 Migratory Bird Management personnel in Prince William Sound, it has been determined that the price of fuel to complete these additional projects will be in excess of $25,000.00. Shoreside Petroleum has been found to be the only fuel vendor in Whittier, Alaska for dockside fueling of boats and commercial vessels. There are no other dockside fueling outlets or businesses in Whittier, Alaska.    This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to evaluate any proposals or offers received.

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Mr. Anthony Austin, 276 Goose Creek Road, Hubert, NC  28539 for the following: 

Recovery and subsequent disposal of ghost Black Sea Bass traps in the U.S. South Atlantic Fishery Management Area

Objectives

1. Address gear assessment, impact, and recovery.
? Mapping and documentation of traps on hard bottom habitat
? Video documentation of trap condition on site and active ghost fishing
? Subsequent recovery of derelict gear, assessment on land for gear configuration compliance, and recycling or disposal of gear after data is collected.
2. Attempt to codify the reasons for gear loss and to suggest regulations to enable loss prevention.
? Employ a statistically sound sampling frame in which to conduct our survey based on known hard bottom habitats and personal logbook data within Onslow Bay, NC.
? Using a low light video camera and GPS coordinates, map out specific trap locations.
? Employ skilled Nitrox-certified divers to search and recover traps from the mapped sites within the sampling framework.
? Assess gear compliance with regulations and impact on environment on site through video taping.
? Recover gear with minimal bottom and habitat destruction and bring it ashore for full assessment and data collection.
3. Work with partners to design and promote use of more eco-friendly gear types.
? Escape panel compliance
? Use of sinking line instead of floating line to reduce the risk of navigation hazards and whale and sea turtle interaction
? Accounting for gear each licensed fisherman possesses (i.e. enforce tags be turned in at the end of the year and have a fine associated with missing tags)
? Partner with recreational divers to develop the systematic trap removal

Approach

Black Sea Bass fishing is usually conducted on hard bottom; the locations where the fish occur are well known. In the South Atlantic most traps are set in depths between 40 feet and 100 feet, depths well within the reach of SCUBA survey. We propose to test a novel approach to systematic trap removal using a statistically sound research protocol. We will target known hard bottom areas and shipwrecks with documented major trap loss within 120 square miles in Onslow Bay, west of Cape Lookout, North Carolina using a towed low light video camera to identify traps. The exact GPS coordinates will be recorded and mapped for our subsequent recovery efforts. Once suspected trap locations have been recorded, we will deploy 2 vessels with divers employing dive scooters to extend the range of the survey and to increase recovery efficiency. One of our partners is a commercial fisherman who will use his 35-foot lobster boat, rigged for diving, and trap retrieval. The other partner is a dive charter vessel that will assist in the recovery effort with its dive crew. Dive charter boats work daily during the spring, summer, and fall, and we propose to go only when those boats indicate visibility is over 30 feet. To prevent bottom and habitat disturbance we will not encourage excavation of buried traps if they pose no risk of ghost fishing. The traps will be videotaped when found, sent to the surface with a lift bag, hauled on the lobster boat, and brought back to shore for individual assessment.

Benefits

By collecting and removing ghost fish traps from the proposed survey area, we will be cleaning up fishing grounds, fish habitats, and help to eliminate ghost fishing by these traps. We will estimate the number of lost traps in proportion to the number of fished traps in the Black Sea Bass fishery in the survey area. These data will give us an estimate of how many traps are out there and whether or not they are in compliance with regulations (i.e. escape panels and identification tags). Our results will be shared with the NOAA NMFS Regional Administrator and South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) to help formulate appropriate management measures for the Black Sea Bass fishery. NOAA will also serve in a broader role in marine conservation, public education, and environmental stewardship by educating and partnering with divers to clean up the bottom hard bottom habitats. The partners will develop and demonstrate a trap recovery technique that will be expanded to other trap and pot fisheries in the southeast U.S. and elsewhere within diving ranges. We will communicate our techniques through the distribution of pamphlets to recreational dive charter businesses. Additional audiences will include Fishery Management Council Meetings, hook and line recreational and commercial anglers (i.e. through NMFS, NGOs (i.e. Environmental Defense), North Carolina Fishermen?s Association, Angler tournaments like Big Rock Blue Marlin (by putting a ? page ad in their program)). The North Carolina Maritime Museum and North Carolina Aquariums have also agreed to work with us to create displays to educate the general public about these concerns and highlight the partnership efforts that are recovering the derelict gear. Some ideas we have include using recycled ghost traps for the displays, video kiosks with video loops from the ghost traps, and a request for a 10-15 minute film to show in the auditoriums.

<SUBJECT>U -- Customization and Presentation of Duke University's Implementation of NEPA Training Course
<SOLNBR>FSM-07-406
<RESPDATE>072007
<ARCHDATE>08042007
<CONTACT>Betty Freeman, Purchasing Agent, Phone (301) 415-0587, Fax (301) 415-5761, Email bhl@nrc.gov - Valerie Whipple, Senior Contract Specialist, Phone 301-415-6514, Fax 301-415-5396, Email vmw@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source contractual agreement with Duke University for the development and presentation of a customized version of  the Duke University?s Implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) training course to NRC staff.  

Duke University co-sponsors with The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), a Duke Environmental Leadership Program (DEL) that offers a Certificate in NEPA .  The CEQ coordinates federal environmental efforts and works closely with agencies and other White House offices for development of environmental policy and initiatives.  The course is specifically designed for mid-level and senior project managers who work to streamline the environmental permitting process for federal facilities and federal regulatory activities; and to prepare and review environmental assessments, environmental impact statements, and other NEPA analyses.  The course  provides the necessary tools to address the environmental effects of agency actions and to ensure that environmental impact analyses are substantively and procedurally accurate. Instruction aids students in determining the proper level of documentation to fully record and disclose to the public the results of environmental analysis.  

While there are other entities who provide training on NEPA, CEQ does not co-sponsor a same or similar NEPA training program with any other entity.  Due to the critical role that CEQ plays with respect to NEPA activities as indicated in Section 3 below, Duke University?s training course co?sponsored by CEQ and as such, would be appropriate for use by a federal regulatory agency in the area of environmental reviews under NEPA.

The period of performance shall be from the date of award through December 31, 2008.  This notice of intent is neither a request for quotes or a solicitation of offers.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates an ability to meet the NRC?s needs.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted to Betty H. Freeman, Purchasing Agent, at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Division of Contracts, Mail Stop T-7I2, Washington, DC 20555 via mail no later than July 11, 2007.  Questions may be submitted to Ms. Freeman at (301) 415-0587.  No request for quotation document is available.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the manufacture and calibration of the Trisonic Wind Tunnel balance # 250-B.  NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Modern Machine and Tool Company (MMT) Inc. 11844 Jefferson Ave, Newport News, VA for the following reasons: 1.  MMT has special tools and fixtures for manufacture, calibration, and repair of this model balance. 2.  MTT can calibrate this device traceable to NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technologies). 3.  MMT has manufactured and calibrated four balances as the same type above over the past four years.  Their knowledge and experience from this is invaluable and critical to successfully manufacture and calibrate this precision device and cannot be replaced by any other vendor. 4.  MMT has engineering tools to perform finite element analysis of higher load conditions needed by ARES I wind tunnel testing.  If another company had similar software, they would still have to build a 3d finite element model of the specific balance, and MMT already has that done. 5.  Market Research for this service would not be feasible as the tools and NIST standards used for this process would not be available to other companies.    The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 7/10/2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The DHS S&T Acquisition Division, Washington, DC, intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Battelle Memorial Institute, 2900 Fire Road, Suite 201, Egg Harbor Township, NJ, 08234 for the period of twelve months from date of award. The purpose of this acquisition is an assessment of the potential for adapting the current standard used in the medical industry to a standard to be used in the security screening industry. This assessment is integral to meeting the goal of the Manhattan II Algorithm Standard Project to identify and develop total system solutions to meet the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) screening requirements for checked baggage by upgrading/replacing the current Explosive Detection Systems (EDS).  The new EDS systems will need to allow the integration of information from TSA's Security Technology Integration Program (STIP) and Common Elements system in order for DHS to have the ability to consolidate all the information automatically.  Battelle is currently the only vendor that has worked in the area of defining this interface for the EDS type systems.  This effort requires Battelle's unique technical analysis capabilities in the areas including CT research platforms and CT image quality as well as their access to industry contacts.  Additionally, Battelle has a unique understanding of the systems that are required to be analyzed in this project through acceptance testing with the use of specialized Battelle-developed test kits in support of the TSA, which is necessary for this requirement.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit a capability statement to elizabeth.clark@dhs.gov within 10 days of this announcement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Numbered Note 22.

<CONTACT>Nicole Parish, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-786-0489, Fax 410-786-9643, Email Nicole.Parish@cms.hhs.gov - Leisa Bodway, Contracting Officer, Phone 410-786-1278, Fax 410-786-9643, Email LBodway@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award a fixed cost plus award fee contract to a statistical contractor, with a base performance period of 26-months/one production cycle and two 26-months/production cycles options beginning each year thereafter, to assist CMS in providing statistical and analytical functions necessary to implement an error rate under the Payment Error Rate Measurement Program (PERM) for  Medicaid and the State Children?s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The NAICS code used is 541990 however, CMS has not determined if this will be a small business set-aside. Small businesses should meet all requirements for a cost type contract at time of award such as accounting system must be adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract and that FAR Clause 52.219-14 Limitations of Subcontracting will be incorporated into the solicitation and resultant contract.  

BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: CMS must estimate payment error rates in Medicaid and SCHIP as directed by the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) of 2002 (Public Law 107-300).  The IPIA directs each executive agency, in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, to review all of its programs and activities annually, identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments, estimate the annual amount of improper payments, and submit those estimates to Congress.  The IPIA defines improper payments as: (a) any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount, including both overpayments and underpayments, under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements; and (b) payments made to an ineligible beneficiary, any duplicate payments, payments for services not received, and any payment that does not account for credit for applicable discounts. 
 
CMS has been testing and refining various methodologies to estimate payment accuracy and payment error in Medicaid and SCHIP since fiscal year (FY) 2002.  CMS explored several pilot projects to develop its error rate methodologies from FY 2002 through FY 2005.  After the error rate pilots concluded, CMS implemented the PERM methodology to produce FY 2006 and FY 2007 State error rates for fee-for-service claims, managed care capitation payments, and eligibility determinations.  This is the methodology that CMS intends to continue to use into the foreseeable future to produce national error rates that comply with the requirements of IPIA.   
 
Under the current strategy for PERM, CMS contracts with three entities to identify error rates in the Medicaid and SCHIP programs: (1) a statistical contractor; (2) a documentation/database contractor; and (3) a review contractor. The statistical contractor performs all statistical, sampling and error rate calculation functions; the documentation/database contractor formats State claims data, gathers medical policies from States, and requests medical records from providers; and the review contractor performs the data processing and medical reviews in the States selected for review.   All three contractors exchange information and work together to produce the fee-for-service (FFS), managed care, and eligibility error rates for the Medicaid and SCHIP programs. 
The statistical contractor selected through the forthcoming solicitation will perform the statistical functions for the PERM measurement of each program, which include: 1) collecting State quarterly  FFS and managed care claims data; 2) stratifying Medicaid and SCHIP FFS claims by dollar value; 3) selecting quarterly FFS and managed care claims samples for each of the sampled States; 4) calculating the  State-specific FFS and managed care error rates; 5) calculating the national error rates for the FFS, managed care, and eligibility components; and 6) calculating the overall national program error rate.  The statistical contractor is also responsible for reviewing the eligibility sampling plans of the States selected for review and for all of the tasks outlined in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW). The statistical contractor must work effectively and efficiently with CMS, the documentation/database contractor, the review contractor, and Medicaid /SCHIP State representatives in meeting its responsibilities.
The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990.  This is not an invitation for proposals, request for proposal (RFP), or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal on July 20, 2007 and it will be made available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  We anticipate oral presentations of technical proposals beginning the week of August 20th and an award date of no later that September 28, 2007.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure prediagnostic levels of c-peptide, C-reactive protein, leptin, and adiponectin and risk of pancreatic cancer on a sole source basis with Sir Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General Hospital, 3755 Ch De La Cote Sainte Catherine, Montreal Quebec, Canada. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard in $11M. The acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 in accordance with the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements provided in FAR 13.5. The purpose of this procurement is to provide laboratory analysis of up to 627 Prostate, Lung, Ovarian, and Colorectal Cancer Study (PLCO) cohort stored serum samples.  The laboratory methods for measuring c-peptide, C-reactive protein, leptin, and adiponectin concentrations are described below.  These methods have been shown to be reliable as determined by blinded QC from other DCEG studies.  Sir Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General Hospital shall:  1)  Measure c-peptide, C-reactive protein, leptin, and adiponectin on ~627 PLCO stored serum samples;  2)  C-peptide, leptin, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (duplicate measures) will be analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) with reagents from Diagnostic Systems Laboratory (Webster, TX);  3)  Adiponectin (duplicate measures) will be measured using ELISA using reagents from Millipore formerly Linco Inc. (Charles, MO);  and 4)  The samples will be sent boxed in batches.  All batches and samples within the batches should be assayed in the order provided by NCI.   The results of the analysis will be compared to results from a previous requirement (MQ613017) analyzing specimens from the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Study cohort to investigate the relationship between c-peptide, adiponectin, and C-reactive protein and the risk of developing pancreatic cancer.   Sir Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General Hospital is the only vendor who can perform these analytes and insure the results from this study are comparable to the aforementioned study. It is essential that analysis be performed in a single laboratory, under identical testing conditions, for the data are to be comparable and scientifically valid.  To introduce another testing laboratory would be detrimental to the continuity of the research in progress.  The Sir Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General Hospital is the only vendor known to the DCEG that can process these samples without the introduction of new variables into ongoing research. This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can perform the requirement as detailed they may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EDT, on July 16, 2007.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and must be emailed to Melissa Marino at marinome@mail.nih.gov  and Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor?s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

<CONTACT>Allison Cox-Rudick Contract Specialist (512) 326-6148
<DESC>The Veteran's Affairs - I.T. Acquisition Center has a requirement for a software license agreement for Norton McAfee Anti-Virus and Anti-Spy ware and Anti-Spam protection, software for a period of one base year, with one option year.  The software is currently deployed throughout the VA Infrastructure. To install another type of license, new hardware will be required as well as testing to determine viability on the VA network before deployment is started. The criticality of the architecture makes it necessary to test all major applications before deployment begins. Some sites will require as long as three to six months time frame for testing of new applications. The VA is almost at the end-of-life cycle for the Anti-virus, Anti-spy, Anti-spam protection to effectively secure the VA network.  New hardware would be cost prohibitive. The new licensing is required on or before 08/31/2007. McAfee software is designed to control viruses and spam on the second largest network in the federal government. The estimated value of purchasing the software licensing agreement was estimated at $1,933,960.00.  This action is to justify the use of a Brand Name Description as described in FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description. McAfee licenses can be purchased from a number of agent contractors at a variety of prices. This product will be solicited utilizing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Scientific and Engineering Workstation Procurement (SEWP) IV contracting system as specified by VA directive. Responses to this notice must be in writing and must be received by 12:00 pm CST on July 11, 2007. Third party firms will be considered only if responding with clear and convincing evidence that the Government will avoid additional cost of ownership and production will not be affected if non-McAfee software is purchased. The determination to open brand name competition based on responses is solely within the discretion of the Government. No additional synopsis information will be published, and a solicitation will only be issued to SEWP IV contract holders, regardless of the Government's brand name decision. Responses should be emailed to Allison.Cox-Rudick@va.gov or faxed to 512-326-6028.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of SafeNet Service/Maintenance.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the SafeNet products as a key component of the Department's Remote Access and OpenNet Everywhere server farms.  The equipment and software is currently deployed throughtout the network and laptop environments with over 10000+ DoS clients tied into the system. SafeNet allows access tot he Department of State when accessing the servers from remote locations. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's Remote access networking infrastructure.<BR><BR>

<DESC>LAIRCM NEXT GENERATION (NEXGEN) MISSILE WARNING SUBSYSTEM (MWS) PRODUCTTION PROGRAM UPDATE

The Government hereby issues an Amendment to the final Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Next Generation (NexGen) Missile Warning Subsystem (MWS) Production effort.  This Amendment is issued to clarify Section L & M requirements. 

The current RFP, in the area of Total Evaluate Cost/Price (TECP) had a discrepancy concerning O&S (now Spares & Repairs) with showing it as an other cost consideration and as proposed.  The Government intends to establish a Government Estimate of Spares & Repairs and it will be reflected in the TECP.  Also, it stated that the TECP would consist of all basic award and all options but it stated too that we would present the Depot Repair/Reprocurement data options as other cost considerations.  The Government intends for both of these options to be reflected in the TECP as well.  The Schedule Risk Assessment (SRA) has been moved in its entirety from the Proposal Risk area to the Systems Engineering/Program Management (SE/PM) sub-factor of Mission Capability.  Since the Integrated Master Schedule is a function of SE/PM, the assessment will be done within the SE/PM area.

The Government has highlighted areas to facilitate review; however, other minor clarifications exist throughout Sections L & M that are not highlighted.  The following areas have been amended:

1)	In accordance with Section L, paragraph 6.1.7, estimates of labor categories and hours for Studies and Analysis purposes have been provided in Section L, Attachment L-14.
2)	The RSP requirement kit quantities in Section L, paragraph 6.1.6, page 28 have been updated to reflect the correct amounts as displayed in Section L, Attachment L-11.
3)	The fiscal years displayed for T&M estimates for ICS, Section L, Attachment L-14, have been updated to reflect the correct fiscal years - FY08, 09, and 10.
4)	All references to Operation & Support (O&S) are changed to Spares and Repairs Support.
a.	Clarification to Section L, Paragraph 6.3.4.2; concerning O&S.
b.	Clarification to Section L, Attach L-12, O&S Spreadsheet
c.	Clarification to Section M, Section 6.0, with regards to the evaluation of the O&S data provided by the offeror(s) and Reprocurement Data/Depot Repair Options.
d.	A new Spares & Repairs spreadsheet replaces the O&S spreadsheet  
5)	Clarify Section M, Para 6.3 concerning Total Evaluated Cost/Price
6)	All Cost Realism references were removed from Section M.
7)	References to Schedule Risk Assessment have been clarified throughout Sections L & M.
8)	Model Contract
a.	Revised ASC/GRK-H004 clause and added ASC/GRK-H006 clause to address Reprocurement Data.
b.	Updated Descriptive Data on CLINS 0031 & 0032

Offeror(s) shall submit updated proposals on 27 Mar 07 (Tuesday) no later than 3:00PM (Eastern Daylight Savings Time).

All communications regarding this source selection must be through the contracting officer, Capt Casey Kopecky at (937) 255-1943/0230 or e-mail, Casey.Kopecky@wpafb.af.mil.

<SOLNBR>N00189-07-R-0032
<CONTACT>Aninze Awanna, Contract Specialist, Phone 757-443-1328, Fax 757-443-1337, Email aninze.awanna@navy.mil
<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a Firm Fixed prices type contract with Time and Material provisions for services (including labor) for the development of a threat evaluation software system to improve maritime domain awareness in a selected Area of Responsibility (AOR) as required by the Commander Navy Europe/Commander Sixth Fleet, Naples, Italy.  This is a 100% Small Business set aside under North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) 541511.

The means of achieving this goal under contract will be to apply a COMPUTER ASSISTED MARITIME THREAT EVALUATION SYSTEM software program, fully compatible and interfaced with maritime detection data inputted from deployed equipment, tools, instruments, or other data sources, and authorized to operate in a military or a coalition network environment (classified or non-classified). The contractor shall provide a computer based threat evaluation system together with any other complementary, associated, supporting or bundled programs that will analyze ocean going cargo vessels for security implications in support of comprehensive maritime domain awareness efforts. The system shall allow for utilization of business rules developed in collaboration with coalition/Alliance partners, be approved by the US Navy and access external data to allow accurate, in depth and reliable threat evaluation and analysis, realistic and practical recommendations for interdiction, boarding or other appropriate action. Features shall include: Automatic data stream to identify and geolocate vessels; allow specification of parameters controlling which vessels to evaluate i.e. (geographic bounds, flag state, vessel type or size etc.); allow for access to external data to discover vessel, crew, cargo and voyage data; allow user developed threat evaluation rules and scoring to be applied to data automatically; shall display an operational picture with indications of threat status for all vessels based on a logical combination of scores derived from the application of each threat evaluation rule; and allow drill-down to display logic behind the threat status for each vessel. EXAMINATION OF SOURCE SELECTION PLAN Offerors are invited to examine the Navy Source Selection Plan (SSP), located at http://www.fedbizops.gov.  It is not unusual for an SSP to contain some matters not specifically described in the solicitation, and vice versa.  For instance, the SSP will often identify the evaluation weighting scheme in greater detail, and may include the forms used by the Technical Evaluation Board in reviewing proposals. Despite these variations, both documents are intended to operate in harmony.  If any Offeror discovers an actual conflict between the provisions of the SSP and the Solicitation, this matter must be brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer before the proposal submission date.

<DESC>This modification is to clarify the due date.  It remains July 10, 2007 at 3PM.

The contract ceiling is $2M per contract over 5 years.  Estimated  performance start date is June 2007.

The offer must be able to provide a Registered Communications Distribution Designer (RCDD) Archetect, A RCDD engineer and experienced Senior and Junior technicians.

This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 541380 and the small business size standard is $11M.

In order to be considered for award of this contract, interested offerors, including all entities which comprise a joint venture, and the joint venture itself, must possess a Defense Security Service (DSS) Final Secret, Interim Top Secret or Final Top Secret facility clearance (FCL) with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M.

Offerors must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with the required qualification documentation.
Selected firms possessing a Final Secret FCL will be sponsored by Department of State for an FCL upgrade to the Top Secret level. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the upgraded clearance. A period of 90 days from the date of selection for award will be allowed for the Secret cleared firm to obtain an Interim Top Secret FCL.  After this period, the Government may, at its discretion, consider not awarding the contract to the selected offeror.
Due to time constraints, the Government will not delay award of contracts to selected firms already in possession of Interim and Final Top Secret FCLs.  Contractor personnel requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAA) must possess Secret or Top Secret personnel security clearances issued by DSS prior to performance on the contract.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division (PHD NSWC) provides the following information for the purpose of obtaining market research for potential Small Businesses within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541611.  This action is not a formal Request for Quote (RFQ).  BACKGROUND:  The Naval Warfare Centers have been implementing change to their organizational structure and methods of operation by breaking down organizational boundaries to become one seamless enterprise.  Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) and Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) are working towards operating as one entity.  One of the first steps in the organizational change was to establish the Product Areas (PA) to oversee, in part, the distribution of work to the various WC Divisions.  This process was overseen by a Board of Directors (BOD) that established the focus, direction and organization of the various Divisions.  As a natural part of the evolution o!  f the Warfare Centers, the eleven Pas are being replaced by five Warfare Center Enterprise Executives and an Enterprise Business Executive.  The Enterprise Executives are accountable to the BOD and will perform functions similar to the PAs in that they will be responsible for approving work and ensuring common and efficient business practices are employed across the enterprises.  As a result of the evolution, the responsibility for products and services of the current PA need to be transitioned to various Enterprise Executives and, at the same time, new processes for managing the WCs need to be developed based on lessons learned at the PA level and the requirements imposed by the new organization.  The contractor will provide professional management services to facilitate and assist the Warfare Center (WC) Board of Directors (BOD) in transitioning NAVSEA to the Navy Enterprise Executive (NEE) construct and support the BOD in realigning the WC’s organizational structure, to !  include transitioning the Warfare Center to a Competency Aligned Organ ization.  Additionally the contractor will facilitate and assist the Surface Sensor and Weapon Systems (SSWS) PA to transition its work to the Warfare Center Enterprise Executive (WCEE) Leadership and support the command in realigning its organizational structure to incorporate the new position of the Technical Director and to incorporate the changes required by the transition to the NEE Construct and CAO.   This includes the development of new processes and ways of doing business both within PHD NSWC with the goals of a Competency Aligned Organization and outside PHD NSWC with the other Warfare Centers and the Warfare Center Enterprises.  The performance period will span five years and include a twelve-month base period and four-twelve month option periods.  A Fixed Price contract is anticipated and will be a best value source selection.  This requirement is a potential Small Business Set-aside.  It is required that all interested Small Business’s respond with a one (1) pag!  e capability statement.  The information can be submitted to the via email to: cathleen.Ellison@navy.mil by close of business 11 July 2007.

Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division is interested in receiving proposals/ white papers which offer potential for advancement and improvement of Targeting Accuracy Systems. There is an urgent need for components or systems capable of improving targeting accuracy.  Current weapon systems are capable of engaging targets with an accuracy that exceeds the limits of the targeting equipment.   Technical questions should be directed to Attn: XDS11C, Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren, 17632 Dahlgren Road, Suite 157, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5110, or email to dlgr_nswc_xds11@navy.mil.  Topic Areas of Interest/Objectives The following topics are areas of current interest: Topic: A. Azimuth Sensing System   There is an urgent need for a system capable of improving targeting accuracy. Current weapon systems are capable of engaging targets with an accuracy that exceeds the limits of the targeting equipment. Currently only laser designation provides a practical solution to this problem, however, this makes the operator vulnerable to counterattacks. Accurate knowledge of a user location coupled with range, heading, and elevation to target provides a solution where a brief range-finding designation will allow for a target’s location to be know well enough to call for a precision strike. Provide a non-magnetic azimuth sensing system for use on man-portable targeting devices such as laser range finders and laser designators. This system shall eliminate well known problems with digital magnetic compasses.  his will allow for operation in urban environments, near vehicles, and while wearing body armor. The system will improve on the accuracy of a digital magnetic compass even in good magnetic environments. Reduce Target Location Error (TLE) to be less than 10m, permitting accurate target location at ranges of 10km from observer to target. Due to the needs of the user, the system must work inside a building and be small in size. These limitations rule out the use of all current GPS interferometrics and star finder technologies. The most promising solutions are currently based on gyro-compassing; however, novel ideas are encouraged. The program goals require threshold parameters to be demonstrated within 6 months. After successful completion of threshold parameters the program will take a spiral development approach toward the objective parameters with a total program time of 24 months. The systems characteristic are as follows:  Threshold  a. Man portable fieldable item b. <1 mil Vertical angle accuracy c. Boresightable to optics d. Volume < 0.1 cu ft e. 6 mils azimuth accuracy f. 5 lbs g. 500 deg/s survivable slew rate (may need recalibration) h. < 200 sec startup time Objective a. Handheld fieldable item b. < 1 mil Vertical angle accuracy c. Boresightable to optics d. Volume no more than 0.25 cu in e. 1 mils azimuth accuracy f. 0.5 lbs g. 1000 deg/s operational slew rate (without recalibration) h. < 30 sec startup time  Topic: B. Lightweight Modular Designator The Marine Corps is looking to improve on the weight and usability of current laser designator technologies.  Current man portable designator technologies weigh as much as 30 lbs including batteries. Reducing this weight is the primary motivator behind this effort.   Recent reduction in output energy requirements and improvements in laser technology have made new opportunities available for laser designators. The specifications listed below are the threshold requirements for this new system. Specifications: -1.064 um wavelength -50 mJ output energy -PRF code capable -Designate at least 5 km -96 – 1 minute designations -No more than 5 lbs including batteries -Designator must boresight to optics Topic: C. Laser Designator Research The Marine Corps is looking for opportunities to help transition research and lab development to fieldable technologies.  This opportunity is limited to the field of handheld laser designation.  reas of interest include but are not limited to: -Novel laser technologies -Novel seeker technologies -Laser spot imaging technologies -1.54um wavelength laser and seeker technologies Topic: D. Power Solutions for Distributed Operations Current small unit power is focused on BA-5590, BB-2590, or similar battery technologies. The current requirement is to reduce number, weight, and types of replacement batteries required to support electrical needs of a dismounted unit.  Current systems limit the ability for a dismounted unit to recharge batteries. New and emerging technologies have the potential to significantly improve the logistics burden incurred by distributed and dismounted small unit operations. Areas of interest include but are not limited to: -Power generation technologies for small, dismounted units as well as squad level -Battery charging technologies for small, dismounted units as well as squad level -Various methods for recharging batteries integrated into one package (ex:  hand crank, host country power, DC, solar, etc.) Program goals require initial technology demonstration within 1 year, with a fieldable system demonstrated within 2 years.

<DESC>The current woodland Battle Dress Uniform (BDU) is used by the AF as a working & field uniform.  The Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) is replacing the BDU.  The lighter color way of the ABU camouflage print (AFDTS) will not hide many potential stains.  Air Force Clothing Office (AFCO) compiled data on stains that are of the biggest concern.  As a result AFCO is seeking information regarding industry available, stain repel-and-release finishes.  This is not a solicitation, and no award will be made for this effort at this time.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  The Government holds the right to test any of the fabrics.  All submissions must be Berry Amendment compliant.  Proposed solutions shall be currently available technologies.  New technologies shall be compatible with all salient characteristics and testing requirements of the base cloth as specified in the purchase description (PD) YACL-05-1 CLOTH TWILL AIR FORCE DIGITAL TIGER STRIPE PRINT CAMOUFLAGE PATTERN, 25 July 2005, plus amendments.

FUNCTIONAL CONCERNS
	Types of stains encountered by the Airmen have a correlation to their functional daily tasks & responsibilities.  In Maintenance functions typical stain types include engine exhaust soot, tire break grime, fuel, deicing fluid, hydraulic fuel, mineral vegetable and ester based oils, and liquid oxygen.  In Field use Airmen reported blood, grass stains, dirt stain, red clay, flare (orange/red), and muddy water as typical.  General staining in everyday ?life? tasks such as eating and drinking are tomato, coffee, soda and juices.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION
	AF requests testing results for each product.  For required tests please reference PD and amendments listed above.  Other requirements include effectiveness after exposure to high temperatures in theater, and under rigorous laundering conditions.  Finish should not cause changes in shade, or spectral values a result of application.  Use of Nano technology and other state of the art technologies encouraged.  Any available Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) sheets should also be forwarded.  Since this product will come in close proximity to the skin while in use, proof is required that no potential health issues are posed by the proposed remedy.
	If this fabrication is currently in use please note current applicable industry or military end uses as well as any known positive or negative feedback from current end uses. 
	The USAF would like to keep all current processing the same for the ABU, so that the only changing variable is the addition of stain assistance technology.  This means that we will continue to use the garment dipped process.  As there is some processing that occurs in garment form, this should be taken into consideration when implementing new processes to ensure overall compatibility.  The salient testing characteristics that currently stand should not be reduced by the addition of the new stain process.  We encourage industry partnerships.  If a copy of the cloth or the end item purchase descriptions are needed please e-mail request. 

If needed, request material(s) from a licensed vendor.

<SUBJECT>65 -- Sole Source Purchase of MerMade 12 DNA/RNA Synthesizer
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to BioAutomation Corporation, 8408 Kenning Court, Plano, TX  for a mid-throughput, high-capacity DNA synthesis instrument (12 columns in a single run), that offers the flexibility to handle different scales in each column position in the same run that also supports very large-scale columns, up to 100 umole. This instrument offers additional phosphoramidite ports for special chemistry needs. The particular instrument considered, the BioAutomation Mermade 12, can produce up to 12 different DNA synthesis products of various scales simultaneously. It also supports ten additional non-standard amidite bottle locations for synthesis, allowing plenty of room for accommodating new technologies which might require a number of auxiliary positions. This system can accommodate synthesis scales from fifty (5)) umoles to 100 umoles (=100,000 nmoles), which will enable the laboratory to scale up to unpredecented proprotions should it become necessary. CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.

<SUBJECT>A -- Unclassified Industry Day Conference in support of BAA 07-31 - System F6 Program
<DESC>INDUSTRY DAY CONFERENCE - UNCLASSIFIED: 

DARPA/TTO will host an Unclassified Industry Day Conference in support of the BAA 07-31, System F6 program on July 24, 2007 at Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., 3811 Fairfax Drive, Suite 600, Arlington, Virginia, 22203 from 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.  Registration begins at 6:00 a.m. and the conference will start promptly at 7:30 a.m.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the System F6 program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  A Classified Industry Day will be held on July 25, 2007 and details will be provided in a separate announcement.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The objective of the F6 program is to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a satellite architecture wherein the functionality of a traditional spacecraft is replaced by a cluster of wirelessly-interconnected spacecraft modules.  The resulting space system can be composed of fractionated modules that are physically re-connected on-orbit after launch or remain physically disconnected, but within an established wireless link range, or take a hybrid approach with a mix of physically connected and disconnected elements.  Harnessed together through a robust, secure and self forming wireless network, they create a "virtual satellite," delivering a capability equivalent to, or greater than, that of a monolithic spacecraft, while significantly enhancing flexibility and robustness, and reducing risk throughout the mission life and spacecraft development cycle.  Such an architecture will provide valuable options to decision makers throughout the life cycle development of future space systems which utilize the F6 approach.

The Government envisions a three phase development program.  The first three phases will include concept development, technology maturation, ground testing and integration.  A final fourth phase will culminate in a series of spacecraft launches and an on-orbit demonstration.  Multiple awards for simultaneous execution of Phase 1 by competing Contractor teams are expected.  A Performer Capabilities Matrix and a Performer Capabilities Matrix Input Form are available for download on the registration website.  Any entries will be voluntary and will be updated and posted on the website on a daily basis.  Please complete the applicable form(s) and fax to:  Sean Adinig 703-816-5444 no later than July 17, 2007, or provide an electronic copy to the BAA07-31@darpa.mil mailbox. 

REGISTRATION INFORMATION:  Participants must register no later than July 17, 2007 at the following website:  https://enstg.com/signup/passthru.cfm?ConferenceCode=SYS81863.   The conference code is SYS81863.  Directions to the facility and other materials are also available on the website.  There is no registration fee for attending this conference.
Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 100 registrants, and no more than TWO representatives per organization.

Attendance is not required to propose to any associated BAA.  

Additionally, attendees will be able to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, and/or discuss teaming opportunities in an industry only forum.  No government personnel will be present during this time.  Upon arrival, the attendees will receive their scheduled time for presenting.  The opportunity to present will be afforded on a first come, first served basis.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-194 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-17.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $6.5M.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) to procure a Genome-Wide Association Study from Translational Genomics Research, 445 N 5th Street, Suite 600, Phoenix, AZ 85004.   The Contractor shall provide genotyping for the Phoenix Epidemiology and Clinical Research Branch, NIDDK. Since 1965, members of the Gila River Indian Community have participated in a longitudinal diabetes study. The biennial research examinations are conducted at the NIH Clinic in the Gila River Indian Community. These examinations include testing for diabetes and its complications. DNA has been collected from peripheral blood samples in most participants in the last 20 years. Previous analyses of family data, including a genome-wide linkage study, indicate a strong familial aggregation of diabetes in this community and the presumptive chromosomal locations of one or more diabetes-?susceptibility genes. Current technology now allows for much denser mapping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering the entire genome than has been possible previously. Scope of work is to Genotype DNA samples, to be provided by NIH from approximately 380 participants in the Gila River Indian Community study. Genotyping should include approximately one million SNPs covering the entire human genome. Data will be provided to NlH in a computer-readable format.  The NIH will provide samples of DNA extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes or cultured cells from study participants. The Contractor shall propose the quantity of DNA required per sample, as well as any specialized purification requirements.  The Contractor shall propose the method for genotyping, including quality control measures, for approval by the NIH.  The Contractor will provide the NIH with a computer-readable data set containing genotype results for each SNP typed, identified by each individual DNA sample submitted. The Contractor shall specify, for NIH approval, the data base program or format for data transfer. It is anticipated that all genotyping will be performed in one batch and that all results will be reported together.  Items to be reported are: 1. Electronic data base containing genotyping results from all samples.  2. Report of internal quality control results.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A SEPARATE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 under Simplified Acquisition procedures in Subpart 13.5 as supplemental with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is RFQ92701 and is being issued as a Request for Quote.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-17.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 511210. The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center, Medical Record Department, NIH, CC, MRD, has traditionally coded patients?? diagnoses and procedures utilizing the ICD coding methodology in a very limited fashion focusing predominantly on the need to retrieve historical reference data for research purposes.  These codes are currently determined and assigned based primarily on information included in discharge summary and operation reports dictated by the medical staff rather than additional information/details/specificity that may be available or abstracted from information documented in the medical record.  The MRD currently has a need to raise the CC coding and abstracting practices to industry standard.  Such improvements involve expanding the current processes beyond the review and coding of ambulatory surgery, inpatient admissions, and initial outpatient encounters to encompass a broader range of services including the incorporation of updated ICD-9-CM and CPT coding assignments. The Medical Record Department currently utilizes nearly the full suite of SoftMed??s (3M??s) health information management products and seamless integration with those products is critical.  In addition, these products also send and receive information through well-established interfaces to and from the hospital information system, the Clinical Center??s Clinical Research Information System, CRIS, to support patient care and research activities.  Interfaces between these applications/systems have been established for nearly ten years and allow patient demographics, Admission/Discharge/Transfer Information, medical orders, and medical reports to flow between the SoftMed Systems applications and the CRIS to support the specific functions of incomplete medical record management, medical record tracking, transcription of medical reports, and clinician editing and finalizing of medical reports. In addition, the CC/MRD has the responsibility for maintaining a permanent medical record for each Clinical Center patient for patient care, biomedical research and medico-legal purposes.  These medical records have traditionally been microfilmed for preservation in perpetuity after a five year period of inactivity or patient expiration.  Additionally, active medical records with multiple volumes may have been filmed to conserve storage requirements for hardcopy records.  These microfilmed and inactive medical records have been converted to digital image with storage of these images residing in Softmed??s ChartView application. The purpose of this order is to provide the NIH, CC, MRD with applications and services necessary to support the improvement of coding and abstracting processes described in Section A. above.  Additional outcomes from this initiative include the following benefits/enhancements beyond the current MRD processes:

?X	Code diagnoses, comorbidities and procedures to a much higher degree of specificity.
?X	Provide the ability to understand and abstract coexisting conditions (complications or comorbidities) that affect the patient??s treatment during a particular visit.
?X	Provide a valuable research data set by capturing a complete list of diagnoses, procedures and comorbidities that could be also be pulled into a problem list within CRIS.
?X	Identify and code a primary diagnosis (protocol related diagnosis), admitting diagnosis, and other pertinent diagnoses.
?X	Capture the protocol relative to the patient??s visit/inpatient admission and audit/compare this information to protocols/health issues identified in CRIS.
?X	Provide the capability to understand/analyze coexisting conditions including complications or comorbidities that affect the patient??s treatment for each visit.
?X	Provide a valuable (more complete and accurate reflection of patients?? primary diagnoses/comorbidities and procedures relative to protocol assignment) research data set for historical retrieval and resource allocation/projections.
?X	Enhancement of the current installed ChartView, ESA, and ChartScript applications in the CC/MRD health information management systems to provide web accessibility.


The vendor shall provide the NIH, CC, MRD with the following to meet the objectives identified in Section B., above.

?X	required system software
?X	encoder reference software
?X	software implementation services including project management, onsite training, and technical services
?X	reporting modules
?X	user licenses
?X	24 hours/day, 365 days/year enhancement and support services with access to a support hotline, remote diagnostic support, and all enhancements to installed systems
?X	HP rack-mountable test server as necessary

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subparts 12.6 and 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested by this notice alone, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This synopsis/solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations for pickup trucks to be used by the Government of Bolivia pursuant to an agreement with the U.S. Department of State.

1.0.       DESCRIPTION

The U.S. Department of State, Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) of the U.S. Embassy in La Paz, Bolivia has a requirement for the procurement of up to 90 new pickup trucks to replace old equipment and to allow for an expansion of NAS support to counter narcotics operations in Bolivia.  The primary use of the vehicles will be for the transportation of personnel and supplies to support these operations.  The vehicles must be suitable for extensive travel in rural areas and smaller cities and towns, where deeply rutted and unpaved roads are the norm.  They must also be suitable for travel to remote and mountainous regions, which are accessible only by difficult-to-drive, twisting, narrow and unpaved roads that border on 3,000 to 5,000 foot drops.  The vehicles will also be used for travel to densely forested areas and must be dependable in heavy mud, which is often encountered during rainy season.

The vehicle offered must be capable of being maintained commercially in Bolivia in locations far from the main urban areas and must be covered by the manufacturer's warranties.  Quoters must demonstrate that the vehicles offered can withstand continuous use in Bolivia's extremely rugged terrain and harsh climatic conditions, and that the vehicles are cost-effective to operate and maintain.  The supplied vehicles are to be "new," which is defined as "having zero miles."  Low mileage and/or demonstration models are not considered to be new.  Delivery of anything other than new vehicles shall be rejected and returned at no cost to the Government.  The resulting contract type shall be firm-fixed price.

2.0.       PRICING

The Contractor shall provide the vehicles at the firm-fixed price established below.

Line Item No. 0001: Pickup Truck, Quantity: Up to 90, provide quotation showing unit price and total maximum price, including all features listed below, priced in U.S. dollars.

The above price is in terms of "Cost, Insurance and Freight" (CIF), with final delivery to be made at the Duty Free Zone at Customs in La Paz, Bolivia.  The vehicles shall be insured by the Contractor until such time as the vehicles are received by NAS in La Paz.  The Embassy will clear and title the vehicles.

This purchase order will be a firm-fixed-price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type.

3.0.       PAYMENT

Delivery of the total maximum quantity of 90 vehicles maximum shall be made in two separate deliveries as specified in Part 5.0. below (Period of Performance).

The Contractor may invoice after completion of each of the two deliveries.  Payments will not be made for partial quantities delivered.

The Contractor shall address invoices to:

U.S. Embassy - La Paz
Narcotics Affairs Section (Attn: Won Y. Lee)
Edificio USAID, Calle 9, No. 104
Obrajes, Bolivia

The vehicles are expected to operate on primary roads, secondary roads, cross country terrain and trails, as well as in deteriorated urban environments.

These vehicles will play a significant role in moving personnel and equipment from NAS support sites to remote locations, across terrain that is inaccessible by most vehicles.  The vehicles must be able to negotiate steep hills, valleys and man-made objects that are typical of the obstacles encountered in their various operating environments.  The vehicle must provide sufficient traction, as well as adequate balance and safety (in terms of overturning and/or straining the power train).  It is of the utmost importance that the vehicles provide a stable and safe platform for moving equipment and personnel into and out of operation areas.  In addition to transporting equipment and personnel, the vehicles may be used by security personnel patrolling remote areas in a force protection role, and the vehicles must be capable of being deployed quickly in response to threats.

ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-1:  As prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 42.15, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) evaluates contractor past performance on all contracts that exceed $100,000, and shares those evaluations with other Federal Government contract specialists and procurement officials.  The FAR requires that the contractor be provided an opportunity to comment on past performance evaluations prior to each report closing.  To fulfill this requirement, VA uses an online database, the Contractor Performance System (CPS), which is maintained by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  The CPS database information is shared with the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database, which is available to all Federal agencies.  You are required to register with the NIH CPS database at the following web address:  CPS - https://cpscontractor.nih.gov.  Further, your registered representative data, as well as any other information in your registration data, must be kept current.  Performance evaluations entered into CPS by the contracting officer will be assigned to the contractor's registered representative for comment.  Failure to comment and reassign the report back to the contracting officer, or to maintain current registration, will result in the Government's evaluation being entered in the database with a statement that you have failed to respond.  Help in registering can be obtained by contacting CPS Support E-mail (cps-support-1@list.nih.gov) or by calling (301) 451-2771.  Pursuant to FAR Clause 52.212-4, para (t), Central Contractor Registration (CCR), after initial registration, the contractor is required to update registration data as changes occur and must re-register annually to ensure all data remains current.  Noncompliance with this requirement will preclude the exercising of any option periods that may be included herein and will be cause for termination of the contract at such time noncompliance is discovered.  Refer to cited Clause for more details.  You are required to register with the CCR database at the following web address:  CCR - http://www.ccr.gov.  IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU COMPLETE THESE REGISTRATIONS IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED FOR CONTRACT AWARD.  AWARD CANNOT BE MADE TO A CONTRACTOR NOT REGISTERED IN BOTH OF THESE DATABASE SYSTEMS.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR HIGH RESOLUTION STEREO PIV SYSTEM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to provide clarification for requirement 11 and to extend the due date for quotes. Clarification is as follows: NASA Ames has software to perform calibrations and PIV processing that is not integrated with any camera controller software or drivers. We would like to be able to acquire a snapshot during testing and have the recorded image pair immediately available for evaluation through this software. This interface would be a customization of the camera control software provided by the vendor. The in-house software is written in C and is compiled as a stand-alone executable. The vendor should quote cost on a per-hour basis for this customization function. The due date for receipt of offers is extended to July 12, 2007.   Quotes received prior to this amendment will be evaluated and do not need to be resubmitted.  However, please send an email to Kevin Sasur at ksasur@mail.arc.nasa.gov stating there is no change to the original quotation and for acceptance of this amendment. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on June 13, 2007.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-07-10469, and the solicitation is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-16. 

A. Background: The Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 mandated EPA to develop a plan for study to support arsenic ruling that would reduce the uncertainty of health risks of arsenic.  Health Effects of arsenic have been observed above 200  g/l in drinking water.  Research is needed to establish a dose-response relationship, especially at low doses.  The objectives of this requirement are to identify subjects; provide historic arsenic exposure information; and obtain, translate and provide data entry services for clinical data for assessing the health effects of arsenic exposure via drinking water in the endemic site of arsenicism, Hangjin Hou County, Ba Men in Inner Mongolia.  The data will be obtained as part of an ongoing hospital based case control study that aims to enroll 400 patients with cardiovascular disease, and 400 matched controls over a three year period of performance to ensure the required number of subjects can be obtained.  The contractor shall perform the following tasks: 

Task 1: Medical record translation and collection, and subject identification. The contractor shall work closely with local public health officials, the cardiologists and hospital staff in Hangjin Hou County  to identify cases with cardiovascular disease and disease free controls for the ongoing case-control study.  The contractor shall collect and maintain detailed records of each subject and clearly identify all records by assigning unique identification numbers. 

Task 2:  Data entry and management;  verification of clinical records; and collection of historical arsenic exposure records. The contractor shall provide double-data entry using a Microsoft (MS) Access data base of the data from the questionnaires and the clinical reports.  The contractor shall translate the data entry fields and pilot test the database. The contractor shall check and resolve discrepancies with the doubly entered data and provide the US EPA with a clean and verified data base. This may include revisiting the patient or the patient?s family to obtain clarification or additional information. Questionnaires and other data information shall be submitted in hard copies to the EPA Project Officer at the completion of this purchase order. The contractor shall also examine existing records for historical arsenic exposure measures from the study area and provide these previous records to the US EPA. 

Task 3: Questionnaire and data quality assurance. The contractor shall review all questionnaires to ensure there are no missing, illegible or obviously incorrect responses. The contractor shall correct invalid responses as necessary. The contractor shall review all other data collected (ECGs, echocardiograms, medical test results, and existing arsenic data) for clarity and correctness.  Optional Quantities for additional translation, quality assurance and data management up to 200 records may be completed within the
base period of performance.

Final Report & other deliverables: Final report shall be in hard copies with detailed description and record of data collection, translation, and QA procedures used during the study.  The clinical and arsenic exposure data bases shall be submitted in the form of computer disks or other electronic forms. Questionnaires with clinical information and other relevant data information shall also be provided in hard copies. All the delivery items, including questionnaires, medical records and translations, databases and the final report will be delivered to the EPA project officer at EPA, Human Studies Division at Chapel Hill, North Carolina upon completion of performance.  Partial Payments will be established based upon enrollment of 400 subjects each and receipt of database.    

The following FAR provisions apply to this solicitation: 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors?Commercial Items; 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items.  Evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of provision 
52.212-2 are as follows: The Government intends to award a single contract to the responsible offeror whose technically acceptable quotation represents the best overall value to the Government based on the evaluation of the technical criteria, past performance, and price.

<DESC>Solicitation Number S-WHARC-07-Q-0015
Questions and Answers, Round 2

Question #5: Are the trucks required to be manufactured in the U.S.?
Answer #5: No. The vehicles are not required to be manufactured in the U.S.

Question #6: Is the Ocean Vessel to La Paz, Bolivia required to be made on a U.S. flag vessel?
Answer #6: See FAR clause 52.247-64, Preference for Privately Owned U.S.-Flag Commercial Vessels, which is included in the solicitation.  The FAR can be accessed on the Internet at http://acquisition.gov/far/index.html.

Question #7: "Having zero miles" - The units we are offering will be from factory so they will be "new," but we may have to move the vehicles to our supplier to get the winches mounted - max approx. 15/20 miles total - would this low mileage be an issue?
Answer #7: A very few miles would not be an issue, provided that it can be clearly shown that the miles are directly related to preparing the vehicles for delivery under the contract.  The main point is that it must be clear that the vehicles are new from the factory, and that they were not used as demonstration vehicles or in any other capacity that is inconsistent with being classified as new vehicles.

Question #8: 4.2.19. lists door locks - do they want manual or power locks?
Answer #8: Manual locks are sufficient.

Question #9: Is this a small business set aside?

Questions and Answers

Question 1: In Section 4.2.19 a caution plate triangle is required.  Is this to be permanently affixed to the back of truck, or are they requesting a folding style that stores behind the seat?
Answer 1: A folding triangle will suffice; it is to be used as a warning sign when the truck is parked in the road.

Question 2: Are these trucks going to be registered in the US or Bolivia? 
Answer 2: Bolivia.  See paragraph 2.0 of the Fedbizopps notice.

Question 3: And if a vendor wins this contract, would they be able to get the US Government to give them a deposit? 
Answer 3:  No.  Payment will be made in accordance with paragraph 3.0 of the Fedbizopps notice.

Question 4: What kind of warranty do they want, and what will need to 
cover? (Manufacturer's warranty is only going to cover so much, and it may not even be valid in Bolivia).
Answer 4: The warranty must be valid in Bolivia.  See paragraph 1.0 of the Fedbizopps notice.
