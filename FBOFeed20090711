Objective: 

The Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) characterizes drug substances based on their aqueous solubility and intestinal permeability.   These properties, in addition to dissolution, control the rate and extent of drug absorption from immediate release, solid oral dosage forms.

The prospective project would evaluate a number of commonly used excipients for possible impact on the permeability and absorption of several BCS Class 3 drugs, specifically, drugs with transporter involvement during absorption.  This potential study would complement ongoing studies of drugs with passive diffusion as the main mechanism of absorption.  In vitro as well as confirmatory in vivo studies would be conducted.  The results could support extending biowaivers to drug products in this class.

The contractor would be required to submit to the FDA, several written progress reports 
at scheduled intervals.  At the completion of the program, a single report analyzing the results 
of the study would be provided to the FDA.  

The NAICS code for this forthcoming procurement is 541712. The solicitation number for the procurement will be 09-223-01-00154 and the resultant award is expected to be a combination Labor Hour/Fixed Price contract with a period of performance of for (1) year.

<DESC><p>The Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE) along with 311HSW/Small Business Programs Office and the San Antonio Society of American Military Engineers (SAME) Post will host the 3rd Annual Small Business Conference 28-29 July, 2009 in San Antonio, Texas at the Marriott Northwest. Last year the conference was a huge success with over 260 attendees and we expect it to grow this year. In addition to the two-day Small Business Conference, a third day has been added on 30 July, 2009 to host the first Tri-Service Environmental Performance Based Acquisition (PBA) Roundtable, with a maximum of 150 attendees. This unique opportunity for industry and government dialogue on Performance Based issues is hosted by the SAME National Environmental Committee along with AFCEE, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the US Army Environmental Command (AEC), the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (OACSIM), and the Naval Facilities Command Headquarters (NAVFACHQ).
<p>The Small Business Conference will be particularly significant this year because during the past twelve months there have been a large number of very significant GAO and Federal court decisions with a direct impact on Small Business Programs across the entire DOD. The two hour "State of Small Business Programs" presentation during the conference will provide the latest status on DoD Small Business Programs including recent GAO and court decisions affecting HBZs, 8as, and SDVO's. The information is being provided to enable small businesses to understand all of the recent GAO and Court decisions and to begin positioning for new contracts locally and nationally. In addition, a comprehensive review of the AFCEE Small Business program will be provided to include active and upcoming contracts.</p>
<p>Opportunities for One-on-One Matchmaking Sessions with government agency and prime contractor representatives will also be provided as well as training sessions on sustainable design, commissioning, teaming and Joint Ventures.</p>
<p>Invited Business Forecast Speakers include key representatives from the following offices: the Air Force Civil Engineer (USAF/A7C), the Air Force Small Business Office (USAF/SB), the Director of AFCEE, Brooks City-Base TX, the Commander of the Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency (AFCESA), Tyndall AFB FL, the HQ AETC Civil Engineers, Randolph AFB TX and the Army Corps of Engineers Joint Program Management Office, Fort Sam Houston TX.</p>
<p>The Tri-Service Environmental PBA Roundtable will be limited to only 150 attendees so that three, rotating Breakout Sessions can be held to only 50 attendees each, thereby facilitating discussion between industry attendees and government panelists from each of the services on these 3 major themes: Risk, Contracting, Regulatory Issues. The anticipated topics to be discussed in these breakout sessions include: Risk : PBC Insurance, Risk Management Tools, Small Business Teaming, Regionalization, Proposal Risk, Site Characterization Contracting: PBA Goals &amp; Objectives, Performance Metrics, Payment Milestones, Contracting Options, Two Step Proposal Options, Available Funding &amp; Timelines, Government Oversight Regulatory: Regulatory Environment, Contractor and Government Roles in ROD Amendments, Overcoming Regulator Misperceptions In addition to the breakout sessions, each service will provide briefings on their Performance Based Acquisition programs and Lessons Learned. Participation by Large and Small Businesses is encouraged with priority given to SAME members.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the authority of 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.***

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-34.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Inductively-Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry System (ICP-OES). ***

Background:  The Inorganic Chemical Metrology Group (ICMG) of NIST’s Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory serves as the nation’s reference laboratory for chemical measurements and standards to enhance U.S. industry’s productivity and competitiveness, assure equity in trade, and provide quality assurance for chemical measurements used for assessing and improving public health, safety, and the environment.

 The ICMG has a requirement for an Inductively-Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry System (ICP-OES) on which to perform a variety of inorganic chemical measurements as well as innovative research.  The instrument will be used to value assign Standard Reference Materials (SRMs), such as the 3100 series of single-element solution SRMs, SRM 3182 Chloride, and SRM 3184 Bromide.  It will also be used for other determinations of importance as they arise.  Consequently, the instrument must be suitable for the implementation of the HP-ICP-OES approach, meaning that it must be capable of truly simultaneous data acquisition, simultaneous full spectral coverage, and random and repeated sample vial access.  Further, the new ICP-OES instrument must be capable of acquiring time-resolved data, as required for coupling to a DMA or chromatograph, and must allow easy access to the nebulizer and spray chamber during plasma operation. 

***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

Line Item 0001: Inductively-Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry System (ICP-OES), which shall meet or exceed the minimum specifications outlined in the attachment (NIST ICP-OES Specifications.doc).

The Contractor shall provide installation for the Inductively-Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry System (ICP-OES).  Installation shall include, at a minimum, uncrating/unpackaging of all equipment, set-up and hook-up of all equipment, system verification, and system check for manufacturing defects and any damage during shipment.  The Contractor shall provide a thorough demonstration of all equipment functions.  This must include a demonstration of all salient characteristics herein.

The Contractor shall schedule and facilitate on-site (Gaithersburg, MD) training for at least four (4) NIST researchers. The training shall provide a thorough demonstration of all equipment functions.  This must include a demonstration of all salient characteristics herein.  The training may be scheduled concurrently with the installation.

Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. 

Award shall be made to the quoter whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical capability, past performance and price will be considered. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Minimum Specifications," 2) Past Performance and 3) Price.  

Technical capability and past performance, when combined, shall be approximately equal in importance to price. If Technical Capability and Past Performance are equivalent, price shall be the determining factor. 

Technical Capability:

Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quoters shall include the manufacturer or brand name, make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which addresses all salient characteristics, and clearly documents that the offered product meets salient characteristics stated above.

The primary specifications stated in the specifications document are minimum specifications.  A quoted system must meet all of those to be considered for award.

As noted in the specifications document, stronger consideration will be given to a system that provides one or more of the following secondary specifications:

1.	Spectrometer purging system that does not require a continuous supply of gas (e.g., recirculating system)
2.	Dual-view (axial and radial)
3.	Support for qualitative analysis to identify unknown sample components
4.	Software aids for identifying potential spectral interferences using NIST and/or other recognized wavelength databases
5.	Optical (FWHM) resolution better than 8.5 pm at 200 nm
6.	Capability to vary optical resolution by changing slit widths or other means
7.	Automatic scheduled startup and plasma ignition
8.	Inclusion of service contract for at least 5 years
9.	Inclusion of software upgrades for at least 5 years
10.	Inclusion of consumables kit

A quoted system that fails to meet any or all of the secondary specifications will not be deemed technically unacceptable.  However, by including one or more of these, it will add greater technical merit.


Past Performance:

Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product & service provided and the Contractor’s history of meeting delivery schedules for prior deliverables. Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided and/or the quoters recent and relevant procurement history with NIST or its’ affiliates. Offerors must provide a list of at least three (3) references to whom the same or similar equipment has been provided.
