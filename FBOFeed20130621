<SUBJECT>RESEARCH DATA ASSISTANCE CENTER (ResDAC)
<SOLNBR>HHSM-500-2013-RFP-0046
<RESPDATE>070613
<CONTACT>Scott D. Yeager, Phone 4107869285, Email scott.yeager@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Center for Medicare and Medicare Services (CMS) intends to release a sole source RFP to the University of Minnesota to continue the activities of the Research Data Assistance Center (ResDAC). The purpose of the ResDAC is to assists CMS to increase the number of researchers skilled in accessing and using CMS data for studies which will improve the Medicare and Medicaid programs and add value to current CMS activities. This includes assisting researchers nationwide who may or may not be familiar with the data available at CMS and its use. ResDAC Technical Advisors will describe the data, comment on its applicability to the proposed research, and help researchers with the process of gaining an approved Data Use Agreement (DUA).
<p>Additionally, the ResDAC is to assist CMS with developing new data release procedures that will efficiently streamline the current data request process. CMS is currently changing its data policies and is developing new data access and tracking tools. The coming changes to CMS' data policies and the creation of new tracking tools will affect how CMS releases data to researchers in the future. With the coming activities surrounding the Innovation Center, Federal-State Coordination, research, demonstrations, and other priority agency projects, CMS will need to expedite the data acquisition process as quickly and accurately as possible.</p>
<p>A wide range of research is carried out and supported by CMS, much of it using data that originate from operation of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Medicare program covers Parts A (Hospital Insurance), B (Supplemental Medical Insurance), C (Medicare Advantage programs) and, now, Part D, the prescription drug program. The Office of Enterprise Management (OEM) has and continues to conduct and support research on all programs that CMS operates. The research has involved the evaluation of CMS program changes, the impact of legislation, access to care, utilization of services, the costs of care, health services outcomes, the appropriateness of care, quality of care, the epidemiology of disease in the population and other topics.</p>
<p>A key component of OEM, CMS research support involves collaboration with outside researchers. Researchers in the health services arena are affiliated with other government agencies and commissions (both Federal and State), the academic community (schools of medicine, public health, public policy, and economics), non-profit organizations, private consultants (for-profit health research organizations) and other private sector health services providers (hospitals and Medicare Advantage plans).</p>
<p>In the course of operating its programs, CMS maintains and utilizes a vast array of data. These data provide information on eligibility and enrollment, Medicare and Medicaid providers, claims and utilization, program regulations, and clinical assessment information that support program oversight, research and evaluation purposes. In the early 1990's, CMS became aware that there are many potential researchers who are not familiar with the wealth of complex Medicare and Medicaid data available. Furthermore, CMS data are not always easy to use, even for researchers experienced with administrative databases. Because of the complexity of the data, for the many health care researchers it is often difficult for them to prepare first-time requests with the appropriate level of specificity needed. Researchers are not always aware of what data are available, when updates take place, the applicability of specific data elements, the implications of CMS program changes on data consistency, and techniques for linking CMS data with data from other sources. In the ensuing years, it has become more difficult for even frequent users of CMS data to use the current files being released. Due to changes in CMS policies regarding beneficiary privacy, the linking of data files has become more challenging as the personal identifiers (i.e., a SSN or HIC) for a beneficiary is no longer provided, rather a unique ID per study is being released. In addition to the CMS Data Center, CMS is now distributing data to researchers prepared by contractors (the Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW)) which have different formats. Finally, and very importantly, requirements for requesting the data have evolved to become more stringent in recent years in order to better protect beneficiaries.</p>

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<p>THE HELLAN STRAINER CO (1QZK3) P/N 0603DH-S0401211</p>
<p>Quantity: 18 EACH, DELIVERY TIME 140 DAYS AFTER DATE OF AWARD TO BE DELIVERED TO TRACY, CA. 95304</p>
<p>QUANTITY PRICE BREAK RANGES: FROM 1 TO 6, FROM 7 TO 12, FROM 13 TO 18</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/proposal which shall be considered.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. ;</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP on its issue date of (on or about) <br />2013&nbsp;JULY 05</p>
<p>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved sources are: _THE HELLAN STRAINER CO (1QZK3)</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Reverse Auctioning: "The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., 'Offeror A'). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<DESC>1.	INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE

The purpose of this market survey #14432 is to reissue market survey #11535 that was opened February 15, 2012 and closed March 2, 2012.  The attached requirement documents have not changed and the instructions below have not changed.  This market survey is being reissued in order for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to have market survey industry responses that are less than one year old so that acquisition planning can be based on more current data.  In addition, the small business size standard for NAICS code 541330 has increased from $4.5M to $14.0M.  If your company responded to the earlier market survey #11535, you may elect to submit a new response to this market survey #14432.  Alternatively, you may elect to have your previous submission considered as a response to market survey #14432 by indicating so in an email to robert.c.taylor-ii@faa.gov.

The FAA has a requirement for Architect-Engineering support (A-E) services for the design of a standardized, critical electrical power systems and supporting technical documentation, as well as all training and training related support, critical power distribution system support and technical/engineering support services.  The purpose of this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors, in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1.      

This requirement includes the design only, not build, of electrical power distribution systems for new and existing facilities; the development of power system contract documents; the development of logistics and training documents; the review of construction proposal submittals; and the performance of technical services during construction and installation.  Electrical power system design is comprised of service entrance, standby Engine Generator(s) (EG), Fuel Storage Tank Systems, Uninterruptible Power Supply/Supplies (UPS), switchgear, general purpose panel(s), essential panel, critical panel(s), monitoring software, Static Transfer Switches (STS); Automatic Transfer Switches (ATS) and ancillary equipment associated with the aforementioned equipment.  Replacement or upgrade of electrical power distribution systems in existing operational facilities will require the use of temporary power and extensive planning to ensure the facility remains operational during the transition from old equipment to new electrical distribution equipment.  The FAA envisions making a two-year base award with four two-year options for this effort for a ten year contract if all options were exercised.  However, the FAA reserves the right to determine the contract period that best suits its needs.

The nature of the competition that will be conducted for this procurement has not yet been determined.  The FAA will evaluate the responses to this Market Survey and will make acquisition decisions based on the responses and the FAA's needs.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this requirement is 541330 with Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of $14.0M in average annual receipts.  

All responses (one per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 20 typewritten pages.  No type font less than 11 point may be used.  

The purpose of this market survey is to obtain information that is to be used by the FAA in choosing the method and type of procurement competition to be used to fulfill this requirement.  The FAA requires copies of certification letters for interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation/Notice of Intent Synopsis for a sole source noncompetitive award to Leica Microsystems, Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL for the Upgrade of the Existing MPFM/Confocal Microscope (Leica SP5 Multiphoton/confocal).<br /><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics DIR / Hematology Branch intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis for the upgrade of the existing MPFM/Confocal microscope (Leica SP5 Multiphoton/confocal) to Leica Microsystems, Inc. Buffalo Grove, IL. <br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase an upgrade for an existing microscope (Leica SP5 multi-photon/confocal) to enable Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS). For many years the Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics (LCE) and Office of the Scientific of the Director, has pioneered aspects of non-invasive imaging using methods including MRI and multi-photon microscopy. Non-invasive imaging allows physiological processes to be followed without disruption of the natural environment of the specimen. Upgrade of the existing microscope will enable longer wavelength CARS imaging as well as Multiphoton Fluorescence Microscopy (MPFM). MPFM is a method which has been well established in all three labs for examining many physiological processes in living tissue. In particular, the combination of these two techniques will allow for the multiphoton excitation of luminescent probes and intrinsic chromophores within tissues, and the excitation and probing of vibrational resonances within specific molecules, using a very specific type of CARS (Coherent AntiStokes Raman Spectroscopy) imaging called Spectral-focusing CARS (SFCARS).<br /><br />Delivery shall occur within 60 days from receipt of award.<br /><br />The basis for the sole source determination is based upon the fact that: Leica Microsystems, Inc. is the manufacturer and sole provider of all components necessary for the upgrade.
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) as set forth under FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements.</p>
<p>The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>This Pre-Solicitation/Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being request and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The determination by the Government to award a contract on a sole source noncompetitive basis for the upgrade of the existing MPFM/Confocal Microscope (Leica SP5 Multiphoton/confocal) to Leica Microsystems, Inc. Buffalo Grove, IL is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any information received as a result of this Pre-Solicitation/Notice of Intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct any future competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability for any future competitive procurement by responding to this notice in writing, no later than June 25, 2013 at 11:59 p.m. EST. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement. All responses must reference this Pre-Solicitation/Notice of Intent number NHLBI-CSB-HL-2013-161-RRJ and may be submitted electronically to Robin Jeffries, Contracting Officer at robin.jeffries@nih.gov or by mail to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6122, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Robin Jeffries, Contracting Officer.</p>

Curtiss-Wright Controls Defense Solutions is located at 28965 Ave Penn, Santa Clarita, CA 91355.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to Concurrent Technologies, 6 Tower Office Park, Woburn, MA 01801 for the purchase the following: 

Part Number: PP 402/041-25E (Quantity: 72)

The purchase is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. 

Concurrent Technologies is the design authority and manufacturer of these interface boards that meet form, fit, function, and interchangeability requirements for the LCAC C4N system. As the design authority, Concurrent owns the design rights to their product. Developing another source to meet the requirements as a suitable for this product would be cost and schedule prohibitive; it would require a significant design and development effort, along with a full re-qualification of the system.
 Also, the Government did not purchase the rights in technical data sufficient to perform a competitive procurement because these items are Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) items. Further, no other source for these items currently exists.       

The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Only these items, provided by Concurrent Technologies have been specifically tested and evaluated against the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) technical requirements as provided in the LCAC C4N System Baseline Configuration 3 (SBC3) hardware requirements specification during the productâs formal qualification.
  

Offerors wishing to provide responses/comments to this synopsis shall do so via email to Courtney.henslee@navy.mil no later than the closing date of this synopsis.  The closing date of this synopsis is 09 June 2013.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination required 30 days after contract award. The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price commercial contract.

The Department of Defense will no longer award contracts to contractors not registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database.  Registration may be accomplished by accessing the SAM website at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.

<DESC>The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the Orlando VA Medical Center (OVAMC) are engaged in critical organization-wide initiatives to fulfill public service missions while reducing costs to US taxpayers. This challenge is compounded by public sector healthcare organizations which face both the regulatory and accountability challenges of government agencies and also the expectations and innovation forces of private sector medicine. The Orlando VA Medical Center has aggressively engaged this mandate by authorizing a series of strategic priorities to better serve Veteran patients while ensuring organizational capabilities of all employees. The OVAMC staff is now faced with the challenge to act with transformative results - to transform what will be one of the region's largest integrated healthcare system into the very best - being number one in quality, satisfaction, staff engagement and efficiency.
The requested work focuses on quality healthcare delivery. OVAMC is seeking to develop and implement a Hospital Simulation and Training Program that will enable the identification, development, dissemination and implementation of processes to support OVAMC's delivery of quality patient care.
This project addresses the Leadership priority to provide Veterans with convenient access to information about the VA health benefits, their medical records health information, expert advice, and the ongoing support needed to make informed health decisions and successfully implement their Given the growing needs of US veterans living in Central Florida, a new VA Medical Center is scheduled to open its doors in 2013. This new facility will include a 134 bed hospital, a 120 bed community living center, a 69 bed domiciliary, an outpatient clinic, and a veteran's benefits mini service center. The center will also be equipped with the latest in digital technology and modern technologies. The new OVAMC will increase the healthcare options for approximately 400,000 Central Florida veterans and will be part of the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 8.  It is expected that this new center in VISN 8 will be an exemplar for the VA and quality healthcare across the nation. The OVAMC will serve as a model for new centers in Denver and New Orleans. The standing up of any new organization undergoes a period of adjustment before the people, processes, systems and services are well-aligned and functioning optimally. In a medical care facility, leadership and staff do not have the luxury of a long adjustment period. Processes, systems and services must be up and running from the moment the doors are open and the first patients arrive. An optimally functioning organization accomplishes its mission, using scare resources efficiently and being adaptive in an ever-changing environment.  The work to be accomplished under this contract will enable achievement of the Strategic Goal to "provide veterans personalized proactive, patient driven health care."
The VA requests that a program be developed that shall enable the identification, development, dissemination, and implementation of processes to support OVAMC's delivery of quality patient care. The contractor shall draw from best practices available throughout the VA and other healthcare organizations so as to move OVAMC from a start-up to a fully operational facility. In designing these processes, the contractor shall engage participants from as cross-section of the OVAMC and veteran population to ensure that the voices of all those engaged in the patient care continuum are heard. Initially, focus will be on those processes that ensure veterans have "convenient access to information about VA health benefits, their medical records, health information, expert advice and the ongoing support needed." This contract shall engage personnel from a variety of occupations and positions including Health benefit Advisors, Program Application Specialists, Information Technologists, as well as clinical personnel, Veterans and their caregivers. The outcome of this contract shall be a fully functional medical center that uses state-of-the -art, documented procedures to deliver the highest quality of care. The program shall be designed to reflect the VA's core values (ICARE), PCC principles and VHA's six principles (patient centered care, team based work, data driven/ evidence based , prevention /population health, providing value and continuously improving).
The contractor shall include the following 4 Phases to meet the intent of the government:
"	Build an Operational Foundation
"	Develop Key Processes, Procedures and Guidelines
"	Train the Workforce / Simulate the Work Environment
"	Update/Implement.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Synopsis <br> Basic Ordering Agreement <br> RFP# W912DY-13-R-0007 <br> NAICS 334111 - Electronic Computer Manufacturing <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville (CEHNC) is soliciting proposals on an unrestricted basis for Technology Insertion (TI) under solicitation W912DY-13-R-0007.  In order to accomplish this mission, CEHNC proposes to award multiple Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs), in accordance with FAR 16.703, to all qualified offerors who exhibit the required technical capabilities and past performance for this requirement.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP).  It is anticipated that a RFP will be issued approximately thirty 30 days after the release of this announcement. <br>  <br> Requirement: <br>  <br> The HPCMP continues to enhance its ability to support DOD and the warfighter through the acquisition of balanced HPC systems for five (5) DOD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) and multiple Dedicated HPC Project Investments (DHPIs).  Under the proposed BOAs for TI, the contractors (who must be Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)) will provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and non-personal services necessary to provide sustainable, state-of-the-art, HPC capability for the DOD research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) community. This capability will be introduced through a series of technology insertions (TIs) in direct support of the DOD HPCMP's mission - to accelerate the development and transition of advanced defense technologies into superior warfighting capabilities by exploiting and strengthening U.S. leadership in supercomputing, communications, and computational modeling.  <br>  <br> The offerors will deliver balanced, commercially-available, production-grade HPC systems, which contain an appropriate combination of processor, memory, disk I/O, interconnect, and operating system (OS) capabilities in order to conduct complex, tightly-coupled, large-scale, scientific calculations. Salient system attributes include: <br>   A reasonably high byte to floating point operation (FLOP) count ratio (when comparing peak CPU memory bandwidth to peak CPU floating point capability); <br>   2GB to 3GB of memory capacity per computational core; <br>   At least 50GB/s, 50GB/s, and 75GB/s of read, write, and full duplex bandwidth, respectively, between the compute and I/O subsystems for every 1,000 computational nodes in the system; <br>   At least 20GB per core, 20GB per core, and 0.5GB per core of formatted usable disk storage for /work1, /work2, and /home (respectively); <br>   A tightly integrated interconnect with:  <br>   o Each link having at least 40Gb/s of network bandwidth;  <br>   o An end-to-end latency that is less than 5 s (five microseconds);  <br>   A well-tuned OS with low jitter <br> Evaluation Criteria Overview: <br> Each offeror will be evaluated for technical capability and past performance and will be rated as  quote mark Acceptable quote mark  or  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark .  BOAs will be established with offerors who receive an  quote mark Acceptable quote mark  rating in the following evaluation categories: <br> 1.	Technical <br> a.	American Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) status <br> b.	Technical capability  <br> c.	Administration and maintenance  <br> 2.	Past performance  <br> a.	Recent and relevant past performance <br> b.	Past performance questionnaires and interviews <br> It is estimated the program requirements for this action will total $330M over a five (5) year period.  The BOAs will be reviewed annually. In addition, an annual pre-solicitation notice will be issued to provide the projected requirements for the upcoming year. At that time, new firms may submit proposals to join the BOA pool. Once BOAs are established, it is the Government's intent to solicit only those firms holding a BOA for this requirement; however, this does not preclude other firms from submitting proposals.  Each Order RFP will be posted on the FedBizOpps through the Army's Single Face to Industry (AFSI) portal for public awareness. All orders will be solicited on a Firm Fixed Price basis. All proposals received will be evaluated in accordance with established criteria unique to each order requirement.  The BOA itself is not a contract.  The orders against the BOA will become binding contracts upon award. <br> The Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers. Offeror's are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider past performance data obtained from other sources, the burden of proof of applicability rests with the offeror. This solicitation will be issued in electronic format only and will be available on or about 15 April 2013  <br>  <br> Note: Response Date referenced under General Information does not refer to the proposal due date. The estimated BOA Proposal Due Date is 15 May 2013, and the official due date will be stated in the solicitation. <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address:  <br> USACE HNC, Huntsville, P. O.

<DESC><p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN: 6pt 0in">I. DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>1.0 Purpose<br />The Air Force Space and Missile Center, in support of the Range and Network Systems Division (SMC/RN), is seeking contractor capability statements and potential solutions to make a transition in the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) ground communications architecture from its current serial-based configuration to an Internet Protocol (IP) network over the next two to six years using open standards and Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) products.<br /><br />The AFSCN is a worldwide low data rate network of Remote Tracking Stations (RTS) responsible for connecting Satellite Operation Centers to satellites to support launch, early orbit, on-orbit and end-of-life Telemetry, Tracking and Commanding (TT&amp;C) state-of-health operations (See Attachment #1). The current AFSCN ground communication system relies on proprietary Wide Area Network Interface Units (WANIU) to program multiplex and de-multiplex serial and IP data, respectively. These WANIUs were developed in the 1990's and are approaching their end-of-life due to parts obsolescence and increasing maintenance costs. A replacement to the WANIUS will be necessary to maintain the operational readiness of the AFSCN and support the AFSCN transition to an IP-based network.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 517410 - Satellite Telecommunications. The Applicable Classification Code is "D- Automatic Data Processing and Telecommunication Services". The small business size standard is $30 Million</p>
<p>2.0 Background<br />This SMC/RN upgrade/modernization effort seeks to substantially reduce AFSCN's operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs by replacing obsolete serial-based WANIUs and related serial communications interfaces with an IP-based architecture. Respondents should contact the Project Officer to request copies of the referenced attachments.<br />The WANIUs are proprietary communication devices which provide the WAN UDP/IP interfaces for data transport across the AFSCN and are responsible for connecting AFSCN network users (Satellite Operations Centers) and supporting organizations (Network Operations Centers) to the appropriate RTS in order to conduct Satellite Operations. The WANIUs support data types including telemetry, command and echo, control and status, timing, and analog voice. The WANIU also provides for multiplexing and de-multiplexing of support data through dedicated multiple input/output ports (See Attachment #2). The WANIUs support proprietary buffering, data processing and flow control to aggregate the serial data, packetize it, and send it at fixed intervals to meet latency requirements.<br /><br />The goal of this RFI is to identify the open-standards, COTS solutions, and contractor capabilities needed to transition the AFSCN ground communication architecture from its current serial-based interfaces to natively IP-capable interfaces. This would enable seamless integration of AFSCN with AFNet for services such as security monitoring and network defense. During this transition, the WANIUs and their serial interfaces will be retained for Serial SOCs Communication interfaces and the current Automatic Remote Tracking Stations (ARTS). The ARTS sites are currently being replaced by the Remote Tracking Station Block Change (RBC) modernization program, an IP-based capability. However, both ARTS and RBC programs currently use the serial side of the WANIUs as their communication interface. This is necessary in order match the existing serial communication protocol originating from the SOCs that access the RTSs (both ARTS and RBC) for Telemetry, Tracking and Commanding (TT&amp;C) Operations). See Attachment #3 for current WANIU configuration and Attachment #5 for ARTS replacement with RBC schedule.</p>
<p>3.0 Qualifications <br />Responders should be familiar with serial and IP networks and have successful experience in transitioning from proprietary serial networks to open source and COTS IP networks.</p>
<p>4.0 Information Requested <br />Proposed network topology diagram detailing devices, interfaces and protocols for IP implementation along with serial topology elements to be supported through transition. Special consideration should be given to AFSCN Time Data Correlation and Time Critical Commanding constraints on the network. Request that your response address the following:</p>
<p>1. Explain corporate experience in transitioning communication architectures from serial to IP networks.<br /><br />2. Identify and provide an open standards and COTS based architectural solution(s). Describe, map out, and explain your transition solution(s) for the WANIF based upon a transition from the current serial architecture to the mixed serial/IP-based architecture solution(s). Specifically, we are interesting in understanding how you would maintain the SOC WANIF and ARTS/RBC's WANIF serial interfaces until: (1) the ARTS and (2) SOC serial interfaces are replaced by IP, bearing in mind that the AFSCN's architecture will ultimately migrate to a solely IP-based network. While a box-for-box replacement of the WANIUs and associated equipment/interfaces is acceptable, modular replacement (temporary or permanent) of functionality will be considered. During the transition period, contractors should assume replacement of the WANIUs with WANIFs devices that have both serial-to-IP capabilities.</p>

<DESC>This questionnaire applies to the US Army's conversion effort for the existing fleet of M3A3 Cavalry Fighting Vehicle (CFV).  The intent is to convert the M3A3 vehicles into the M2A3 Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) to meet future fielding requirements. Prior to the actual conversion of the vehicles, an Inspect and Repair Only As Necessary (IROAN) effort will be required. Potential Suppliers that have not previously completed a major Bradley production program will be required to complete vehicle qualification testing at the corresponding Government test sites. <br>  <br> The purpose of this questionnaire is to evaluate the capability of the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) or other qualified equipment rebuilders to convert and support this equipment.  This questionnaire is designed to gauge the interest and current capability of industry.  The total estimated quantity of M3A3 to M2A3 vehicles to be converted is 150 each. The vehicles will be provided incrementally over a three-year period; however, production may not be continuous due to the availability of seed vehicles.  Fielding of the converted vehicles is anticipated to begin in second quarter of Calendar Year 2015. <br>  <br> Please answer all questions applicable to your products and capability.  Any supplemental information concerning the performance, availability, reliability/maintainability etc., or any other literature concerning your company's warranty program, production longevity, and reputation would be useful in this survey. <br>  <br> There is no risk for you participating in this survey.  Also, we cannot compensate you for your participation.  However, this is an important opportunity for you to influence the solicitation provisions and contract clauses, our budget requests, and the full range of other elements supporting the acquisition strategy for future programs.

Specifically, we seek a contractor to provide logistical support to monitor catches using at-sea observers and port sampling in order to provide a comparison between sampling methods to quantify effort, species composition of catch, bycatch, catch-per-unit effort and size.<br />The Philippines is one of the top fish producing countries in the world. The provisional catch of skipjack, yellowfin and bigeye tuna in 2010 was ~370,000 mt, with the commercial sector (vessels &gt;3 gross tons) comprising ~70% (Barut and Garvilles 2011). The Philippines probably has the largest number of anchored payaos (Fish Aggregating Devices, FADs) deployed in the world; however, there has been concern regarding the sustainability of payao fish catches, potential for growth overfishing, high juvenile tuna exploitation and predation and adverse ecological effects for other species of concern such as fisheries interactions with sharks and sea turtles.<br />The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541690 with a size standard of $7 million. All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM). NOTE: THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT CONSIDERED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. No solicitation document is available. No contract will be awarded on the basis of responses received to this notice. All interested parties must respond to this announcement by July 1, 2013. Documentation to support the contractor's capability to perform these services must be submitted in writing and include the point of contact and phone number, and a description of services performed under previous contracts for the same services, DUNS Number, SAM, Cage Number, business type and size, and a brief narrative regarding its capability to provide the services as described above. Any response that does not include this information will not be considered. The Government will review each response to determine if the contractor has the experience, knowledge, and capability to perform the services as specified above. Detailed information must be submitted by email to the address noted below by 3:00 PM local (HST) Hawaii Standard Time. Email Address: Bonnie.Oshiro@noaa.gov. Questions of any nature must be addressed in writing as NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE HONORED.</p>

<DESC>Request For Information (RFI) For Dry-dock of Propellant and Work Barges at NASA John C. Stennis Space Center, MS (SSC) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) John C. Stennis Space Center (SSC) Office of Procurement (OP) is seeking potential sources from all categories of Large and Small Businesses with the capabilities and experience to provide the requirement described herein.  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) notice, therefore, is to conduct market research to determine potential sources, capabilities of Small Business firms, availability of services, appropriate terms and conditions, lead time of delivery/period of performance, transportation options, etc. necessary to provide the required services to SSC, as well as explore interest in both the immediate requirement and potential arrangements/options for dry-dock for up to the entire fleet.   SSC is interested in obtaining reviews, comments, and best practices from industry. SSC is considering procurement of these services, and desires technical guidance to refine its requirements.  As such, SSC is requesting industry feedback on the Specifications/Statements of Work (SOW) relative to the subject effort as well as regarding the procurement, proposal response time, handling, delivery schedule/lead time, etc. SSC wishes to determine if there are Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Certified 8(a) Small Business, HUBZone Small Business (HUBZone), Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), or (HBCU), firms with the capabilities and experience to meet the Governments requirement, and the appropriate level of competition and/or Small Business subcontracting goals if applicable.  The NAICS Code and Size Standard for this requirement are 336611 and 1,000 Employees, respectively.  The work to be performed includes the dry-dock, inspection (repair as required), and painting of SSCs fleet of propellant and work barges.	The fleet consists of six (6) Liquid Oxygen (LOX) barges, three (3) Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) barges, and three (3) work barges.  This barge fleet supports rocket propulsion testing at SSC.  SSC also has a Push Boat used for barge transport that will require periodic dry-docking and repair.  SSC has an immediate requirement for dry-dock of one (1) LOX barge and future dry-dock requirements for the entire fleet.  SSC is particularly interested in industrys input regarding the following questions: 1.  Would the vendor be interested in bidding on the immediate requirement for dry-dock of one (1) LOX barge?  2.  If not, what is inhibiting the vendors interest?  Please be specific.  (For example, are there requirements that the vendor cannot or is unwilling to meet within current capabilities?) 3.  What could SSC change about the work scope that would enable the vendor to bid? Please be specific.  (For example, requirements, deliverables, schedules, oversight, etc.) 4.  Would the vendor be interested in bidding if certain requirements were allowed to be negotiated? 5.  If additional barges were added to the immediate requirement of one (1) dry-dock would the vendor be interested in bidding?  If so, how many barges would need to be added? 6.  Would the vendor be interested in bidding on a long term contract (exclusively) or as a potential supplier to an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to provide dry-dock services for the barge fleet? 7.  From the sample requirements provided in the below specifications, would the vendor be willing to comment on whether there are better, more practical, or different but equivalent specifications or methods based on the vendors experience?	If so, in what form would the vendor comment? 8.  If the vendor is not interested in bidding, can recommendations of other potential vendors that may be interested be provided? 9.  Does the vendor have the capability to dry-dock a 65 ft. length, 26 ft. beam Push Boat, nominal 8 ft. draft?  If so, does the vendor have the necessary capability to pull shafts, check propeller balance, sand sweep hull and replace anodes? 10.  Is the 4 month (after delivery to the vendor) period of performance reasonable?  If not, what would be a typical period of performance desired? 11.  In the vendors experience, what would a typical time between dry-docks be for barge vessels of the type described in Sections 3.1 and 4.1 (LOX/LH2 respectively)? 12.  Does the vendor recommend different coatings (i.e., equivalent or better than) the ones listed in Sections 3.19-3.22 and 4.20?  If so, please specify. The information gathered from this RFI will be used for market research analysis and to plan future procurements.  Based upon information submitted in response to this RFI, NASA will determine the final content of any future solicitation(s).  Submissions will also be evaluated for the purpose of determining whether a future procurement may be conducted as a competitive set-aside or issued under full and open competition (unrestricted).  The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), SDV, or HUBZone small business set-aside based on responses hereto for this requirement.  A determination by the Government not to procure this requirement, based upon responses to this notice or other market research, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Although all comments received will be carefully reviewed and considered for inclusion in any possible later action, the initiators of this request make no commitment to include any particular recommendations.  Respondents will NOT be notified of the results of the evaluation of submissions received. This synopsis should not be construed as a formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) or Proposal (RFP) (solicitation) but, rather a Request for Information (RFI) under the authority of FAR 15.201.  Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by NASA to form a binding contract.  This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to make a purchase, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited or be held liable for any information obtained.  Those companies who wish to express an interest in this RFI are asked to submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) that addresses high-level alternatives; general, market-based approaches; experience in this area; knowledge of the work involved; professional resources; and answers to the specific questions requested above.

Qualified industries that possess relevant experience in the field of remote weapon systems, crew served weapons, vehicle/platform weapon system integration, system testing and remote weapon system production will be considered as potential partners. <br>   <br> ARAS is a next generation Remote Weapon System developed by the US Army, ARDEC. ARAS prototypes have been developed for both 7.62mm and .50 cal ammunition and utilize these munitions without modification, as they would be supplied to the M240 and M2 machine guns, respectively. ARDEC has developed impulse insensitive, electrically actuated weapons that provide better reliability, improved inertial properties/balance, customizable kinematics, enhanced accuracy, complete control of firing rate/burst length and accurate round count. The ARAS weapons are mounted via a unique buffer assembly which rejects approximately 75% of the firing impulse forces and houses internally the electrical connections from the weapon to the mount. ARAS has no external cables.  ARAS also consists of an ammunition storage carousel that holds multiple 'active magazines' which can be loaded to the weapon and re-stowed at any time during a firing event. ARAS can reload, or change ammunition type, in approximately 7-9 seconds without human intervention at the weapon.  When an active magazine is re-stowed from the weapon, the weapon is 'clear'. The ARAS magazines are unique for each caliber. The 7.62mm ARAS has 15 magazines which hold 100 rounds each and the .50cal ARAS is designed for 6 magazines holding up to 150 rounds each. The ARAS configuration enables this large stowed load to be decoupled from the weapon gimbal which greatly enhances stabilization and aiming performance without over designing the Az/El drives, bearings, gearboxes, power consumption and structural stiffness.   <br> 	 <br> ARDEC will schedule a series of one-on-one disclosure meetings, with interested and qualified industry partners, for the licensing of the ARAS technical data and partnering to invest in the producibility of ARAS as a system suitable for production/fielding.  ARDEC shall provide a design overview consisting of the weapon, gimbal/structure, active magazine, transfer mechanism and carousel designs. ARDEC shall also show existing prototype hardware in the lab environment with some test videos to demonstrate live fire. Interested parties can be provided an open source, ARAS overview, upon request to the POCs. <br>  <br> ARDEC asks all interested parties to submit a short informational paper to confirm interest in attending a one-on-one event and briefly describe their expertise, capabilities, facilities and relevant experience in the field of remote weapon systems, crew served weapons, vehicle/platform weapon system integration, system testing and weapon system production. Submittals/questions shall be sent electronically to the following points of contact:  Bob Testa, Telephone - 973-724-3620, email - robert.c.testa.civ@mail.mil, and Jim Lee, telephone - 973-724-7679, email - jimmy.c.lee2.civ@mail.mil.    ARDEC will require the processing/signing of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), prior to the one-on-one disclosure meeting, which will be provided by the POCs above. ARDEC shall establish and confirm the date/time for these events and requirements for visiting Picatinny Arsenal directly with those that reply. All data should be submitted by July 21, 2013.   <br> The U.S. Government prefers technical data disclosure, and subsequent partnering, with U.S. based industries. Non-U.S. nationals, or those representing non-U.S. industries, while strongly encouraged, will need to submit the necessary visit requests through their embassies and consider how to address data export restrictions, through partnering or other means, should a licensing agreement be pursued. ARDEC is happy to engage in discussions with foreign industry representatives with the understanding that the material and tech data disclosed would be limited to open source information, Dist A, such as the referenced ARAS Overview and prototype hardware demonstration in a lab environment. We encourage that adequate time be given to process these requests. No sensitive or classified information will be discussed.   <br> NOTE:  This is not a request for proposal, request for quotation, or invitation for bid, nor does its issuance obligate or restrict the Government to an acquisition approach. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of any responses or pay for the preparation of any information submitted or use of such information. All information received will be used for planning and market research purposes only.

<DESC>a.	THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement; due to the limited time for script development, unique scope complexity, and available time to conduct site surveys in the exercise cities. Complete Parachute Solutions is the sole manufacturer, retailer, and vendor certifier for the Military Javelin Parachute System (MJN-1). All riggers, instructors and jumpers can only be trained on the use of this parachute system through CPS. Half of the candidates in the Reconnaissance Training Course (RTC) receive their basic free fall qualification on the MC-4 and do not receive jump training with night vision devices, body armor or tactical high altitude-high opening operations with the MJN-1. The first time they are exposed to these jump profiles is at AFF. Due to safety considerations, CPS is only vendor that can successfully transition these candidates in a timely fashion and cover the operational, rigging and inspection specifications for the MJN-1. The Mission Installation Contracting Command - Fort Benning GA, intends to make an award to Complete Parachute Solutions, Inc. 1320 E. International Speedway Blvd. Suite 1 DeLand, FL 32724. Interested parties may email shawn.o.peynado.mil@mail.mil no later than 28 June 2013, 12 p.m. EST.

<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
<p>EBSCO Industries, Inc., SS-CFPB-13-0073</p>
<p>The Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), intends to contract with EBSCO Industries Inc., 10 Estes St, Ipswich, MA 01938, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, for a subscription to three of the EBSCOHost academic journal collections. EBSCO Publishing has been identified as the only source capable of providing the required content in an arrangement that suits the needs of the CFPB.</p>
<p>The mission of the CFPB is to educate the consumer as a first line in defense against abusive practices; to enforce consumer financial laws via the supervision of banks, credit unions and other financial companies; and to gather and analyze available information to better understand consumers, financial service providers, and consumer financial markets. In order to meet the above listed missions, the CFPB is establishing a library to serve as a focal point for reference materials that not only show current events, but events through the course of history that have shaped the financial environment as we know it today.</p>
<p>EBSCO Publishing provides index coverage dating back to 1886, comprised of searchable bibliographic databases, links to full-text subscriptions, full-text book reviews, full-text working papers, full-text journals, current full-text access and is an a la carte subscription that allows users to select which collections will be relevant to their specific needs. Since the CFPB conducts financial market research, it was found that the content contained in EBSCO's Academic Search Complete, Business Source Complete, and EconLit with Full Text collections is crucial to the successful completion of the CFPB mission. Access to all three databases will allow CFPB users to simultaneously search these databases which will result in thorough research of a wide range of disciplinary-specific literature critical to creating accurate and effective work products, thus enabling CFPB to make well-informed decisions in regards to marketing, management, MIS, POM, accounting, finance, and economics.</p>
<p>Although EBSCO Publishing has an active agreement with the Library of Congress via their FEDLINK program, the required content for the CFPB does not fall within scope of the existing agreement.</p>
<p>The identified contractor, EBSCO Publishing, is one of the leading database providers for libraries and other institutions. Their collection of over 375 full text research databases and their organization of these collections into smaller, a la carte collections that can be tailored to meet an individual organization's specific needs make them the only firm capable of providing the content required by the CFPB.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by June 27, 2013.</p>
<p>Responses shall be submitted electronically to PSB3@bpd.treas.gov, Attn: BBURNWORTH.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>Mathematica software is used by the entire&nbsp;corps of cadets&nbsp;at the US Coast Guard Academy (USCGA) and is used heavily by the Department of Mathematics. The software offers an interactive classroom experience that helps the students explore and grasp concepts, and that it gives teachers&nbsp;the right&nbsp;and effective tools they need to easily create supporting course materials, assignments, and presentations. Mathematica is the the basis of&nbsp;math curriculum at&nbsp;the USCGA.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Mathematica software has been used over the past six (6)&nbsp;years extensively in a majority of the math classes and requires annual renewal&nbsp;from WOLFRAM RESEARCH, INC.,the developer of the&nbsp;software which is proprietarily sold by this company and is not available through any channel or seller vendors.<br /><br />Using a different software every year, the Academy would need to re-write the&nbsp;entire curriculum to teach students, and faculties would need to familiarized themselves&nbsp;with the new software to teach their class.<br /><br />Any company that believes they can meet these requirements may give written notification. Supporting documents and materials must be sufficient to support minimum curriculum standards set by USCGA.

		IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 		INA - Immigration and Nationality Act 		INS - Immigration and Naturalization Service 		SSA - Social Security Administration 		INS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program 		ESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor)
	(a) Authority.  Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.
	(b) Who is Covered.  INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination.  These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.
	(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements.   Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S.  The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9).  Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer.  Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site: http://www.ins.gov/graphics/services/employerinfo/index.htm .
	(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs.  The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees.  Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program.  If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9.
(1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235.
(2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia.  The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem.  To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981.  Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
(3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature.  If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature.  To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
	(e) Employee Rights.  The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.
	(f) Compliance Assistance.  More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
	(g) Penalties/Sanctions.  Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions.  As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms.

A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings.

<DESC>The Economics Staff of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Office of Planning (OPl) has a requirement to provide accurate and timely economic assessments of FDA regulatory actions. These analyses have high public visibility and, therefore, must withstand intense scientific and technical review and scrutiny by diverse audiences including the public, regulated entities, Government agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of Management and Budget, the U.S. Congress, professional economists, and the scientific and medical community. The need of the Economics Staff for support by a contractor arises from the variety and complexity of the work, the need to have access to specialized resources to rapidly gather data to meet tight deadlines, and the need for research involving direct contact with regulated entities.<br /><br />See attached RFP for further details.&nbsp;

<p>Background:</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR), Division of Neurotoxicology, Jefferson, AR has a requirement for Stainless Steel Cages to house 40 Squirrel Monkeys.</p>
<p>Under the theme of enhancing product safety, in collaboration with the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products (CTP), NCTR will develop animal laboratories for the study of biological processes associated with the behavioral pharmacology of tobacco and related products including nicotine and nicotine-like chemicals. Among other activities, these laboratories will study the constituents of tobacco products that may affect the reinforcing properties of nicotine as they pertain to nicotine's ability to initiate and/or maintain self-administration and vice versa. Towards this end, direct use, non-capitalized scientific equipment animal housing and testing apparatus will need to be procured. More specifically, the Government will purchase equipment and supplies to support 40 NHP Squirrel Monkey (Saimiri Sciureus) species for nicotine self-administration studies. Prior to obtaining research primate subjects, adequate and compliant caging must be obtained.</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>The NCTR Division of Neurotoxicology has the need of obtaining appropriate direct use, scientific equipment via animal caging-housing space for 40 NHPs. Animal caging required is such as that outlined in the Animal Welfare Act Regulations, or its' associated caging equipment to support 40 NHP Group 1 (up to 1.5 kg) species individuals. The species of choice will be Squirrel Monkeys (Saimiri Sciureus). This division requires at least 3.2 square feet (floor area) and at least 30 inches tall (height from cage floor to cage ceiling)/76 cm (height) per monkey.</p>
<p>The Government will employ 2 over 2 minimum cage specifications with modular interlocking capabilities between units (e.g., 10 units capable of containing 4 singly housed monkeys each, etc.). The preferred total width for the 2 over 2 units is between 40" and 44" (101.6 to 111.8 cm), such that five connected units would require between 200" and 220" of wall space.</p>
<p>In order to use cages for both singly or pair housed animals, and to allow singly housed animals to have some access to each other, self-storing and/or integrated horizontal panels with three options are needed:</p>
<p>&bull; Solid (no contact with animal in adjoining cage) <br />&bull; Partly mesh and/or barred (allow for grooming contact with animal in adjoining cage)<br />&bull; Partly open (complete access to either side by an animal)</p>
<p>Additionally, the enclosure caging should comply with and provide ability for addition of enrichment means of expressing noninjurious species-typical activities. Enrichment devices may include perches, swings, mirrors, or other increased cage complexities at our discretion to stimulate forging or task-oriented feeding behavior and all the while providing interaction with the care giver or other familiar and knowledgeable person.</p>
<p>Statement of Need:</p>
<p>Based upon advice from experts that were consulted during our due diligence efforts to establish tobacco-product relevant behavioral pharmacology laboratories at NCTR, and in consultation with staff from NCTR's Veterinary Services Division, appropriate NHP animal housing, feeding, and enrichment equipment will be purchased. Considerations of the unique characteristics of the Squirrel Monkey species Siamiri, thus influencing our caging choice, are that the species Locomotes on all four limbs (use both vertical and horizontal space). They use their tail for balance and perch rather than sit like other primate species such as our in-house Rhesus Macaque. Their perches shall be round in shape instead of flat shelves or twin bar to avoid the development of pressure sores on the tail. Additional considerations are that perches shall be positioned at multiple levels to maximize three-dimensional use of space within the caging environment. The use of thermo neutral materials for perches is desirable. Finally, cages shall provide the ability to attach and/or introduce enrichment devices (e.g., forage board or puzzle board, etc.) to cage as desirable-to include swings, moving perches, or objects hanging within the cage, such as plastic chain or looped PVC tube.<br /><br />Salient Characteristics (Minimum Cage Specifications):</p>
<p>&bull; At least 3.2 square feet (floor area; single cage)<br />&bull; At least 30 inches tall (height from cage floor to cage ceiling; single cage)<br />&bull; 2 over 2 with the following specifications (4 cages total comprises one unit; total of 10 units needed)<br />o Modular interlocking capabilities <br />o Self-storing and/or integrated horizontal panels or other mechanism with at least three options:<br />&#61607; Solid (no contact with animal in adjoining cage) <br />&#61607; Partly mesh and/or barred (allow for grooming contact with animal in adjoining cage)<br />&#61607; Partly open (complete access to either side by an animal)<br />o A fourth option for the horizontal panels is to provide visual access (e.g., Plexiglas, etc.) but this is not absolutely required<br />o Panels dividing upper and lower cages shall be partly removable and/or adjustable to allow vertical access between cage compartments for exercise or pair housing. Using adjustable panels (instead of completely removing a panel between upper and lower cages) allows us to maintain floor space when calculating the amount of floor space per animal.<br />o Exterior measurements that do not exceed 44" in width (total for one unit) <br />&bull; Stainless steel (respondents shall specify stainless steel gauges)<br />&bull; Heavy duty stainless steel casters that are 1 piece (no parts glued in) and have 5"x2" polyurethane wheels (two with brakes and two without brakes) with zerk fittings<br />&bull; Squeeze back <br />&bull; Two perches (preferably located at different heights) on two different cage walls <br />o Pull bar mechanism for a squeeze back may serve as one perch <br />o Perches shall be rounded and not be flat shelves <br />o The use of thermo neutral materials for perches is desirable, though this may not be possible for the pull bar mechanism that may serve as one perch<br />&bull; A cage design that allows as much light and visual access as possible (e.g., bars and/or mesh, etc.) is most desirable, though a solid back panel will likely be required for cage stability <br />&bull; Bar at top of cage for hanging enrichment items (e.g., hanging plastic chains, swing, etc.)<br />o Some enrichment items may be hung from wire mesh cage tops but this may ultimately limit the type of enrichment items that may be used<br />&bull; Front panel shall include access for a pole and leash system, feeders, card holder, and water bottle holders (note that we will use 32 oz water bottles (3 inch square; 9 inch overall) and not an automatic watering system)<br />o Ability to attach and/or introduce enrichment devices (e.g., forage board or puzzle board, etc.) to cage front is desirable <br />&bull; Guillotine style door with complete swing out capability<br />&bull; Cage locks <br />&bull; Rear drainage pans</p>
<p>Offerors shall include a complete description of the interior (single cages) and exterior measurements (entire unit) along with drawings/renderings of their design that includes all specified features. Pictures of previously fabricated cages are highly desirable.</p>

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>7. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>8. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Brenda.l.lentz@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>9. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 1100 Pacific time on 01 JULY 2013.</p>

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to London.c.venzon@uscg.mil . Technical questions shall be emailed to Nasaria.e.valadez@uscg.mil. Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 0800 Pacific Time on 12July2013.</p>

      (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25.  For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act.

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--
    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
    (1) Listed end products.
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin

	
    (2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.]

    (2) __ Outside the United States.
  (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
    [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--
      (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;
      (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003- 4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and
      (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.
    [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003- 4(d)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--

      (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));
      (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
      (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

  (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)
    (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
    (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).  If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest directly with the Contracting Officer responsible for this acquisition should review the procedures at FAR Part 33 and send your protest to LTC Warren Seymour, at warren.g.seymour.mil@mail.mil . Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527; Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)&mdash; (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held&mdash; (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to include the following change: (1) Section I Funding Opportunity Description: add additional Focus Area for FY14. No other changes have been made.<br /><br />(1) Insert the following under Section I: FUNDING OPPORTUNITYDESCRIPTION: and After Focus Areas for FY13: <br /><br /><strong>FY14 Focus Area<br /><br />Mission-Driven Tasking of Information Producers<br /><br /></strong>The objective of Mission-driven Tasking of Information Producers (MTIP) is to enable asynchronous collection requests and synchronous tasking control of information producers based on consumer mission information needs derived by tactical information management (IM) services. While applicable in many domains, the focus of this project is on ground users interacting over tactical networks with one or more piloted aircraft to collaborate on surveillance and targeting. Existing tactical information dissemination is limited to information that has been produced as a result of the sensor operator's actions, a labor intensive task that competes for the pilot's attention, slows down surveillance and target prosecution, and results in suboptimal sensor allocation. MTIP seeks to improve this process by using consumer information needs (as expressed through subscriptions and queries) to generate and prioritize tasking for information producers (e.g., airborne sensors) in order to optimize their value to multiple consumers (e.g., ground users). This project will also enable consumers to satisfy time-critical information needs through the synchronous tasking of producers, including closed-loop control. The MTIP objectives require development of technologies that enable opportunistic task generation, prioritization and scheduling of tasks among multiple sensors and multiple platforms based on mission needs, and synchronous tasking of sensors to include closed-loop control.<br /><br />Offerors are encouraged to:<br /><br />&bull; Design and develop IM services that derive information needs from the subscriptions and queries registered with the IM platform as well as from an analysis of anticipated mission information needs for which there is no information in the IM repository, and present these needs as tasks to the proper information producer.<br /><br />&bull; Investigate methods to aggregate requests for information into a single task (when those requests share data or when they can be partially fulfilled by existing information) to improve tasking efficiency for a shared resource.<br /><br />&bull; Design and develop a task prioritization software prototype that continually evaluates opportunistic task requests against mission relevance as well as the cost of collection and dissemination.<br /><br />&bull; Design and develop IM services that broker connections between information producers and consumers and investigate protocols that enable synchronous tasking and closed-loop control of producers by authorized consumers.<br /><br />&bull; Build upon existing Tactical Information Management user clients for a Multi-Function Display, Android mobile devices, and FalconView to enable asynchronous collection requests, synchronous tasking, and sensor operator input and override.<br /><br />Offerors are encouraged to build upon existing IM and QOS components for this work, including the AFRL-developed Marti tactical information management services and Android Tactical Assault Kit (ATAK) [1], in order to maximize productivity for the research and to provide maximum benefit to the Government.<br /><br />For this focus area ONLY: Individual awards will not normally exceed 30 months with dollar amounts normally ranging from $250,000 to $600,000 per year. The recommended date for submittal of white papers for this focus area ONLY is July 31, 2013. Please send your white paper to: <a href="mailto:James.Metzler@us.af.mil">James.Metzler@us.af.mil</a>. If you have questions please contact James Metzler at 315-330-4033.<br /><br />[1] Gillen, M.; Loyall, J.; Usbeck, K.; Hanlon, K.; Scally, A.; Sterling, J.; Newkirk, R.; Kohler, R., "Beyond line-of-sight information dissemination for Force Protection," MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, 2012 - MILCOM 2012 , vol., no., pp.1,6, Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012

<DESC>The initial responses to the RFI were very helpful to the Department as it continues to develop a strategy on improving the capacity of the Department and the field to evaluate GEAR UP. In order to further refine this strategy, the Department seeks additional information on existing GEAR UP data sets with current and/or prior year data that could be made available to the Department and authorized parties through restricted use-data licenses and used for rigorous, large-scale, multistate evaluations of the GEAR UP program.
<p>The Department is specifically looking for existing data sets and ongoing data collections that include:<br />&bull;	Individual-level data on at least 50,000 GEAR UP students in at least 12 different states including<br />o	Data on GEAR UP services received (with common data definitions and protocols across different projects and states).<br />o	Data on student achievement scores comparable across different GEAR UP projects and states.<br />o	Data on GEAR-UP students' postsecondary achievement. <br />&bull;	Comparable data for non-GEAR UP students in the same cohort(s)<br />&bull;	Capacity to collect/compile additional academic progress data in future school years for participating students</p>
<p><br />Responses should be submitted to Sara.Steinberger@ed.gov with a copy to Alice.Mihill@ed.gov no later than 4:00, June 28, 2013.</p>

<DESC><p>Q&amp;A from 6/20/20131) <br />Who is responsible for construction staking, as there is no separate pay item for this? <br />&nbsp; a. The contractor is responsible for the layout of the job, per 109.05(b), Scope of Payment, Indirect payment. The government has provided 3 control points on the drawings for a professional surveyor to base their shots off of. <br />2) Why is the riprap commercially sourced? Why can't the contractor get the riprap from the Joshua Pit down the Grave Cr. Rd. from the project? <br />&nbsp; a. The government is unsure what material is currently in the Joshua Pit and advises all contractors to bid as commercially obtained as shown currently in the drawings.<br />3) Is seeding and fertilizing required? <br />&nbsp; a. No, but the drawings note that the topsoil needs to be removed and conserved during clearing for placement on the disturbed areas after construction is complete.<br />4) Why is only 20 CY of unclassified borrow spec'd out when the embankment quantities on the drawings are greater? <br />&nbsp; a. The 20 CY are shown as government-furnished from the Frozen Lake Pit and shall be used to mix with any excavated material as needed for the embankments to be built up to the bridge deck. Kattell and Chad Porter feel that most of the material that will be excavated during construction will be suitable for embankment, which is where the remainder of the material will come from.</p>

<DESC>This is a revision to a previously issued SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  If your firm responded to the initial announcement in March 2013, and remain interested in this revised scope of work, there is no need to resubmit.  This is not a solicitation announcement.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement, and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement.  The purpose of this announcement is to obtain information only and to identify contractors who possess the capabilities to provide services as specified below.  In preparation for a future procurement, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Atlantic is performing this market research to aid in the development of its acquisition approach.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to identify companies with the capacity, experience, and interest in competing for a Base Operating Support (BOS) Services Contract at U.S.
 Naval Support Activities in Gaeta and Gricignano, Italy to include all outlying support areas.  The work includes, but is not limited to, providing all management, supervision, labor, materials, and equipment necessary to provide services for: General Information, Management and Administration, Facility Support (Facility Investment, Custodial, Pest Control, Integrated Solid Waste Management, Recycling, Grounds Maintenance and Landscaping, Pavement Clearance), Utilities (Wastewater), and Environmental.

The work will be accomplished under a combination Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) and Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract.  The contract term will be a base period with a potential of four one-year option periods.
  However, there is a strong likelihood that not all option periods will be issued as it is currently intended to further consolidate requirements to include the BOS Services at Naples, Italy when the current contract for those services expires, currently anticipated in the fall of 2017.

The NAICS code is 561210, Facility Support Services.

These services are currently being performed via three separate Combination Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts as follows:
NAVFAC Contract N33191-10-D-1001, Gaeta BOS â U.S. Naval Support Activity Naples Gaeta facilities in Southern Italy.

NAVFAC Contract N33191-07-D-0226, NSA Support - U.S. Naval Support Activity, Gricignano Italy.

NAVFAC Contract N33191-13-D-2001, Shuttle Bus Services, Naples, Italy

A Best Value Source Selection procurement is envisioned that includes both price and technical proposals.
  As permitted by FAR Part 10, we are requesting responses, comments, recommendations and suggestions as Market Research and Request for Information to assist in the development of our acquisition strategy.  If you are interested in performing this requirement, please complete the following market research questionnaire/Request for Information and submit your completed response No later than 28 June 2013 to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Michelle Gooden, via email to michelle.gooden@navy.mil.  Please note that your submittal should not exceed five pages.  Please also note that if you responded to the original notice in March 2013, there is no need to resubmit.
NOTE:  THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CANCEL THIS ACQUISTION AT ANY TIME.
  THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COSTS INCURRED IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROCESS.  ALL INFORMATION SUBMITTED IS AT THE OFFERORâS OWN EXPENSE.
Please also note that any recommendation/suggestion provided in response to the Market Research Questionnaire/Request for Information may be utilized without any restrictions whatsoever or cost to the Government and may be included in the PWS.
We appreciate your interest and thank you in advance for responding to the questionnaire/request for information.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.

The purpose of this amendment to the Request for Information (RFI) is to provide responses to clarification questions received, and to extend the date for receipt of responses to the RFI from 21 June 2013 to 28 June 2013.  There are no other changes.
 

Question:  Is there an incumbent contractor associated with this work?  If so, are you able to provide the name of the contractor and the contract #?  Or, is this considered a new requirement?

Answer:  There is no incumbent contractor associated with this work.

Question:  If this is a new requirement, is there an estimated dollar value, or NTE value associated with this requirement?

Answer:  There is no NTE or estimated dollar value associated with this requirement.



Question:  Being that there is a four (4) page limit, are you looking for a compliance matrix or more of a capabilities overview?

Answer:  The Navy is looking for more of a capabilities overview that addresses most of the overarching requirements and includes the cost model for future expansion.

Question:  Paragraph 3.2.1: Requires compliance with SEIWG-0400.
  Please provide a copy of the referenced TV-1 for our review.

Answer:  At this time, this GFI artifact is not available for public consumption.  Once evaluated, a determination will be made to extend access to this government-controlled specification.  Non-compliance with this specification will be treated as neutral and, therefore, not counted negatively against the review of the response.

Question:  Paragraph 3.2.3 (b): Required compliance with SEIWG-0300 and ICD 0101B.  Please provide copies of these documents.

Answer:  At this time, this GFI artifact is not available for public consumption.  Once evaluated, a determination will be made to extend access to this government-controlled specification.
  Non-compliance with this specification will be treated as neutral and, therefore, not counted negatively against the review of the response.

Question:  Paragraph 3.7.7:  Please identify the LAMAS/RAMAS.  Is an interface specification available and, if so, can it be provided?

Answer:  Alarm integration via the OPC standard for alarm and event handling is desired for this interface.

Question:  Paragraph 3.9.5.1: Please identify the VPMS equipment/software.

Answer:  At this time, this GFI artifact is not available for public consumption.  Once evaluated, a determination will be made to extend access to this government-controlled specification.  Non-compliance with this specification will be treated as neutral and, therefore, not counted negatively against the review of the response.
  Compatibility with the OGC SWE (SensorML, TransducerML, SOS, SPS, and SAS) standard will be sufficient for addressing this requirement.

Question:  We respectfully request allowance for an appendix that provides a compliance matrix exempt from the page count requirement.

Answer:  An appendix comprised solely of a compliance matrix aligned directly to the requirements within the RFI is acceptable and will not count against the four (4) page limit.

Question:  Can you please clarify whether the entire response is limited to only 4 pages?  Also, confirm that the page limit does not include the Attachment #1 Response:  PSIM Requirements.

Answer:  The entire response (excluding the cover page and table of contents) shall be limited to four (4) pages.
  An appendix comprised solely of a compliance matrix/response aligned directly to the requirements within the RFI is acceptable and will not count against the four (4) page limit.



Question:  Please give an example of the use of stored data correlation to generate an alert.

Answer:  In the event an unauthorized person attempts to gain access at multiple entry control points (i.e., pattern of intentional persistence), an automated alert may be generated based on multiple sources of data collection / processing (e.g., Access Control System, Video, Analytics).
 
Question:  Please give an example of how an authorized user would modify an association based upon time and other relationships and what results would be expected from such a modification.

Answer:  Restricting and/or modifying access to particular user groups or standard operating procedures (SOPs) for coordination and response based on threat conditions (i.e., Force Protection Condition [FPCON]), time of day, shift, job description, location of restricted area, maintenance period, environmental conditions, etc.

Question:  How many bases is the Navy planning on installing the PSIM?

Answer:  This is an RFI to better understand the state of the art and existing industry offerings.
  No definitive plans for procurement and installation have been finalized.

Question:  Over what period of time does the Navy plan on installing the PSIM at these bases?

Answer:  This is an RFI to better understand the state of the art and existing industry offerings.  No definitive plans for procurement and installation have been finalized.

Answer:  This is an RFI to better understand the state of the art and existing industry offerings.  No definitive plans for procurement and installation have been finalized.

Question:  Are the bases both domestic and international?

Answer:  This is an RFI to better understand the state of the art and existing industry offerings.
  No definitive plans for procurement and installation have been finalized.

Question:  What type of contract is planned?

Answer:  This is an RFI to better understand the state of the art and existing industry offerings.  No definitive plans for procurement and installation have been finalized.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) conducts various types of scientific projects with the Department of Defense and other governmental agencies throughout the United States and other countries under the USGS Department of Defense Environmental Conservation (DODEC) program.  These DODEC projects investigate various types of contamination-related problems and conduct environmental studies at Federal facilities.  Typically these projects require analytical services for chemical analyses of environmental (water, solid, air, and biological) samples for organic and inorganic constituents, and geotechnical analyses of solid (sediment, sludge, and soil) samples using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) analytical methods and other published analytical methods such as Standard Methods and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) methods.  Legally defensible data meeting strict quality control standards are required.  Analytical services may be needed for chemical and geotechnical analyses of environmental samples collected by the USGS for other regulatory-type projects requiring USEPA or similar published, standardized analytical methods and well-documented analytical and quality-control results.
