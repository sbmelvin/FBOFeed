<RESPDATE>071607
<ARCHDATE>08152007
<CONTACT>John Gamble, (202) 385-6133
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to extend contract DTFAWA-07-C-00008 with Metron Aviation, Inc, of Herndon, Virginia.    Metron provides Concept Engineering and Development (CED) support to the Collaborative Air Traffic Management Technologies (CATMT) Program. The Metron contract was awarded for the period January 5, 2007 through September 30, 2007 as a "bridge contract," an interim means of getting necessary work done while completing a competitive procurement for a new CED contract.  The procurement plan at that time proposed an award date of June 30, 2007.  However, due to extensive rework and coordination on the statement of work, the original estimated award date of June 30, 2007 has been extended to November 12, 2007.  We therefore intend to extend the Metron Bridge contract for a period of two months, from September 30, 2007 to November 30, 2007, with an option for another three months to allow for transition of work in the event a new contractor is selected. As a result of extending the Metron bridge contract a maximum of five additional months, the contract ceiling amount of $3,273,434.00 is increased by $1,500,000.00 to $4,773,000.00 to cover the extended period of performance, and the potential transition period.   If you have any questions or comments on this contract action, please contact the Contracting Officer, John Gamble no later than close of business July 16, 2007 at (202) 385-6133, or email at john.gamble@faa.gov.

<CONTACT>Paul Reed, Contract Specialist, Phone (206) 526-6034, Fax (206) 526-6025, Email paul.j.reed@noaa.gov
<DESC>NOAA?s National Marine and Aviation Operation, Office of Ocean Exploration, has a need for the design and installation of a Tele-presence System aboard the NOAA Vessel OKEANOS EXPLORER. 

The tele-presence system will serve a multitude of purposes (including but not limited to the following): (1) Route video from up to 24 HD/SD/analog cameras (12 shipboard, 12 mounted on two remotely operated vehicles) to displays distributed throughout the ship, a video capture/storage subsystem, a video frame grab subsystem, a multi-view subsystem and a video encoder subsystem; (2) Provide a multi-view subsystem for viewing all of the available camera sources on a single display for use by ROV operators and science personnel; (3) Provide a frame grab subsystem capable of capturing and storing individual video frames from HD, SD and analog video sources for use as still imagery; (4) Stores up to three video feeds (possibly HD quality) for up to 20 days.  The stored video must be tagged with the capture date and time as well as the camera source; (5) Routes KVM, and individual VGA signals from up to 24 computers to 14 user stations and view-only LCD stations, distributed throughout the ship; (6) Provides video encoding/IP encapsulation capable of compressing and packaging multiple live, HD quality video for simultaneous transmission to shore-based destinations via satellite link; (7) Provide an intercom subsystem, capable of communicating not only with ship-based intercom stations but also with shore-based stations over an IP-based network via a satellite link.

Description of Operations: The NOAA Ship OKEANOS EXPLORER will operate in both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, often in areas far offshore. The ship will be outfitted with a two-vehicle ROV system which will carry high-definition video cameras, still cameras, and oceanographic sensors to water depths up to 6,000 meters. The video signals and data will be transmitted from the ROVs to the ship through a 17mm electric/fiber-optic cable to an ROV control room onboard the ship.  ROV position information will be collected via an Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL) acoustic tracking system also located in the ROV control room. The ship will be equipped with a multi-beam sonar system that will be linked to acquisition and map processing workstations co-located in the ROV control room. The objective of the tele-presence system is to ensure the information from these sources is appropriately distributed to work stations onboard the ship, as well as to ensure the information can be transmitted to shore.

Key Components: Key components and capabilities for the tele-presence include but are not limited to the following: Video encoding subsystem (with embedded audio); Video routing and switching; Multi-view video subsystem; Video format conversion HD/SD/analog; Video frame grab subsystem (HD/SD/analog sources); Video capture and storage subsystem; Onboard video editing workstation; Intercom subsystem; KVM and VGA matrices; and Video displays including: ROV control room (x3) 42 inch high-definition (HD), ROV control room (x4) 8 inch HD, Dry lab (x1) 25 inch HD, Equipment room (x4) 8 inch HD, ROV workshop (x1) 20 inch standard-definition (SD), and Bridge (x1) 20 inch SD.

Full delivery of the system will be required no later than ten (10) months from the date of award. Award is expected in the late August or early September, 2007 time frame.  The solicitation document will be available for download from the FedBizOpps website on or about May 21, 2007. No paper copies will be issued. Interested parties should use the FedBizOpps [REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION] and [REGISTER AS AN INTERESTED VENDOR] feature which provides notification when the RFP becomes available for download and all postings associated with the solicitation, thereafter.

The NAICS Code is 334220 with a size standard of 750 employees.  All questions regarding this solicitation must be in writing and addressed to Paul.J.Reed@noaa.gov.

<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research and development (R&D) proposals in the area of High Frequency Integrated Vacuum Electronics (HiFIVE) with the goal of demonstrating an integrated, microfabricated vacuum electronic (VE) high power amplifier (HPA) circuit for use in high-bandwidth, high-power transmitters.  The proposer will exploit high precision microfabrication methods to construct a highly efficient VE interaction structure with the goal of achieving high-power (>50W) and high-bandwidth (>5GHz) amplification in the ?upper-millimeter-wave? spectral region, specifically at an operation frequency of 220GHz.  As a key part of this effort, the proposer will develop an advanced cathode source and beam focusing approach leading to a 20keV electron beam characterized by very high transverse aspect-ratio and current density.  The proposer must establish the ability to control the coupling and energy exchange inside the amplifier interaction structure without deleterious mode competition effects.  Thermal management approaches will be developed to mitigate the extremely high heat loads which are expected to result from the inadvertent interception by the interaction structure of part of the electron beam.  The proposer must also identify methods for effective recovery of spent beam energy leading to efficient operation of the VE device.  To further improve HPA efficiency and reduce size, a first-stage driver circuit based on a solid-state monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) technology will be fabricated and incorporated into the overall HPA design.  The program will culminate in an objective demonstration of a compact HPA in which the cathode, the electron-beam, the MMIC driver, the interaction structure, and the collection structure have been closely integrated into a compact assembly.
Proposed HiFIVE R&D should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, materials, devices, and circuits.  Specifically excluded is R&D that primarily results in incremental or evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice

DARPA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) No. 07-49, entitled " High Frequency Integrated Vacuum Electronics (HiFIVE)," is provided as an attachment to this solicitation notice and includes information on the specific areas of interest; the submission process; abstract and proposal formats; evaluation and selection/funding processes; as well as all other pertinent administrative and contractual information.

<DESC>TRANSLATION/INTERPRETATION SUPPORT The Highly Enriched Uranium Transparency Program (HEUTP) implements transparency measures between the United States and the Russian Federation under the bilateral 1993 HEU Purchase Agreement.  The HEUTP provides assurance that weapons useable HEU material from dismantled weapons is eliminated from the Russian stockpile by monitoring its down blending into Low Enriched Uranium (LEU).  The HEUTP achieves these results by sending teams of experts to four Russian uranium-processing facilities, in closed cities, to monitor processing operations.  The program also maintains and staffs a Transparency Monitoring Office (TMO) in Novouralsk, Russia for ongoing monitoring operations at the Ural Electrochemical Integrated Plant.  In addition, the program supports visits by Russian delegations to monitor the US conversion of Russian LEU and fabrication of commercial reactor fuel rods. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Office of Nonproliferation and International Security (NA-24), is seeking small business prime contractor sources.  The objective of this acquisition is to perform an analysis of capability with Basic and options, which includes the following:  analysis of technical strengths and total operational lifetime costs for current site capability. Under this contract the contractor supports critical NNSA functions and provides technical expertise, not generally available in the Federal workforce, in preparing for, conducting, and assessing results from transparency monitoring visits to Russian uranium processing facilities in closed cities located in the Urals and Siberia.  The support activities conducted by the contractor include translation, interpretation, and developing lexicons of technical terminology meeting the program requirements of the Office of Dismantlement and Transparency NA-241 and, potentially, other NNSA organizations. The work scope entails support to the Program Office in Washington, DC and to the TMO staff and the Special Monitoring teams on a recurring basis in Russia.  Support encompasses: translation of documents from Russian to English and English to Russian; interpretation, both Russian to English and English to Russian for meetings, negotiations, and site visits; and, developing and maintaining Russian to English/English to Russian Lexicons of technical terminology associated with monitoring Russian Federation dismantlement and conversion of nuclear weapons materials. The contractor must be fluent in both Russian and English and a native speaker of either one or the other language.  The contractor must possess an engineering degree and be familiar with the uranium nuclear fuel cycle in order to establish agreed-upon terminology for Russian/English equivalents where none previously existed. Contractor representatives must, therefore, be knowledgeable of uranium fuel cycle operations, down blending processes, and monitoring technologies, as well as mission requirements in order to provide the necessary level of support. Familiarity with the plutonium or mixed oxide nuclear fuel cycles would be helpful, but is not required.  The contractor/contractor facility must be equipped to protect Foreign Government Information and DOE Official Use Only information in accordance with established requirements.  While an L or higher clearance is desirable, it is not required. The preponderance (80% or greater) of the anticipated effort for this contract involves short-turnaround (several hours to several days) translations of technical and non-technical documents from English to Russian and from Russian to English.  The documents include formal agreements and correspondence, instructions on the conduct of site visits, assay instrumentation use and maintenance, Blend Down Monitoring System manuals, engineering drawings, and others. It is deemed appropriate to award a Cost Reimbursable contract on other than a full and open competitive basis.   The NAICS code is 541930, size standard of $5M as defined in FAR 19.101.  The Draft Statement of Work (DSOW) is posted as Attachment 1.  The contractual effort is contemplated as a 5 -year period of performance with two base year and three option years with an anticipated ceiling amount of $250,000.  The contract type contemplated is a Labor-Hour instrument.  Work is expected to be conducted primarily at contractors facilities, but some work may be conducted at NA-241 offices, national laboratory sites, Russian production facilities, and other sites as appropriate.  This acquisition involves data that are subject to export control laws and regulations. This is a Small Business Set -A-Side (100%),  contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). The proposal due date is no later than close of business  August 10, 2007 for interested firms.  Points of Contact for this acquisition are: For contracting issues: Ms. Dorothy D. Black, Contract Specialist, OBS/AD, P.O. Box 5400, Albuquerque, NM  87185; telephone (505) 845-4164, fax (505) 284-7493, e-mail: dblack@doeal.gov.

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to solicit and negotiate with only the College of Charleston, Office of Research and Grants Administration, 66 George Street, Charleston, SC on a sole source basis for library and technical information services for the NOAA Center for Coastal Environmental Health and Biomolecur Research (CCEHBR) Lab located in Charleston, South Carolina.  Period of performance will be 15 August 2007 through 14 August 2008.  The FSC for this is R605, the NAICS is 519120 and the small business size standard is $6.5 million.  The resulting contract will be a firm-fixed price contract.
The contractor shall provide scientific library and technical information services required to meet the programmatic responsibilities and assigned mission of the National Ocean Service (NOS) CCEHBR.  The contractor shall perform the following tasks:  accommodate, maintain, and make available to CCEHBR personnel and other authorized users, the current library holdings and future library acquisitions of CCEHBR; provide library services on a normal business schedule during which SCDNR/MRD library is staffed; provide 24/7 access to the reading and study areas; procure and renew annual subscriptions to journals and other periodical publications, provide an automated catalog system to identify all Government library materials separately and distinctly from other materials co-located at the SCDNR/MRD library; provide reference materials, interlibrary loans, document delivery, and bibliographic services including manual and on-line information retrieval searches; provide for delivery of documents to CCEHBR within the constraints of extant copyright law within 24-48 hours following a request from Government personnel.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by July 19, 2007.  Written requests for additional information may be faxed to (757) 664-3653.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.  Questions may be referred to Linda Stein at 757-441-6573 or e-mail Linda.c.stein@noaa.gov.    This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all proposals received within ten days after publication of this notice.  Evidence must be provided of the ability to provide required services.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  To be eligible for award, offerors must have a valid DUNS Number and be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.    
Sole Source Justification
NOS CCEHBR has a science laboratory co-located in a community of marine science institutions.  The Government seeks to ensure staff access in the Charleston, South Carolina area to a comprehensive, physical library collection while providing access for select personnel to more sophisticated or extensive library services, as needed.  The CofC?s library is the only identifiable source that is able to provide the on-site facilities and meet the specified requirements of CCEHBR.  Under a joint project agreement (JPA), NOAA is named one of five cooperators tasked with facilitating and collaborating research in an effort to provide science to sustain, protect, and restore coastal ecosystems, emphasizing links between environmental conditions and human health.  Therefore, it is imperative that the scientific reference materials, research efforts and results generated from the collaboration of the cooperators under the JPA be centrally located and accessible to all parties on a 24 hour, 7 day per week basis.  The CofC library is located within 600 yards from the CCEHBR?s facility and is readily accessible to CCEHBR scientific staff.  The library also supports the College of Charleston Grice Marine Biology Laboratory and the NOAA Hollings Marine Laboratory, both of which are located on the SCDNR campus.  Through frequent collaboration, CCEHBR, SCDNR, and MRD perform environmental research.  Therefore, all reference, research material and peer reviews must be easily accessible and stored in a centrally located facility.  The partnership between CCEHBR and these other on-site research institutions is strengthened by the library?s crucial role in meeting a common need for distributing and sharing of scientific and technical information.

The University of Oregon Exercise and Environmental Physiology Lab is the only known facility of its caliber outside of the Department of Defense specifically designed for human evaluation.  This announcement constitutes the only request for quote; no separate written request for quote will be issued.  Tasking involves 10 to 15 Marines participating in a monitored environmental chamber evaluation to test selected Marine Corps Running Suit designs in various temperatures and environmental climates. The environmental chamber shall be able to sustain the observation of least 10 people taking part in monitored physical activity.  This evaluation will be structured and will last for approxim!  ately 3 to 4 days, from 23 to 26 July 2007.  Marines will test the designs by running 3 miles in each in each simulated climate condition.  Climate conditions include high humidity, cool weather conditions (45 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit), and humid, warm, damp conditions (70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit).  After each session, evaluators will gather data from each Marine on comfort and performance, fit and range of motion of each design.  Areas of interest for evaluation are measuring skin wetness, friction, water retention, water proof level of materials and a full composite of the physiological effects of each design in each climate simulation. The physiological component shall include but is not limited to thermoregulation (including overall sweat rates, maintenance of body core temperature, and cardiovascular strain).  The Marine Corps will require a full data report at the conclusion of testing that analyzes all factors of the evaluation.  The report shall include a thorough !  analysis of each scenario, accompanied by a comprehensive summary of t he findings.  The SIC for this procurement is 8733 and the NAICS Code is 541710.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however interested parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirement by submitting an e-mail response to the MCSC point of contact, Lisandra Torres, at lisandra.torres@usmc.mil, not later than 1400 (2:00 p.m. EST) on July 16, 2007.

All contractors who provide goods/services to the DoD must be registered in th!  e Central Contractor Register (CCR). Online Certifications and Representations at (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov, will also be required. Failure to comply with ORCA registration may make a vendor offeror ineligible for award.

<DESC>Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to extend the N00024-98-C-5197 Aegis Combat System (ACS) Baseline Computer Program Development Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) contract with Lockheed Martin, Maritime Systems and Sensors (MS2) in Moorestown, New Jersey in order to execute FY08 contract requirements.  The extension is a completion effort that will include approximately 550,000 engineering man-hours required to finish the following:  1) Ongoing systems engineering, computer program development, and training materials for the Aegis COTS Refresh 2 effort; 2) The completion and certification of Aegis Software Baseline 7.1R in support of DDG new construction ships; 3) The completion of Aegis upgrades to the Navy test system at  the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) in support of the Naval Integrated Fire Control - Counter Air (NIFC-CA);  this WSMR effort will include systems engineering, integration and testing support; and 4) FY08 CG/DDG Platform System Engineering Agent!   (PSEA) efforts. As the prime contractor since contract award in 1998, Lockheed Martin MS2 has the highly technical and specialized knowledge of the Ships mission, design, combat systems and the associated software that is required for the design, test, certification and validation of these critical mission computer programs.  Lockheed Martin MS2 is the only contractor that possesses the experience, knowledge, technical expertise, production capabilities and facilities necessary to perform these FY08 completion requirements to ensure the Navys fleet critical operational commitments are met.  Competition is being considered for FY08-FY13 Surface Navy Combat System upgrades required to support capability enhancements.  Opportunities being examined include component competition in support of the introduction of the Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP), Common Hardware Design and the introduction of new limited scope warfighting enhancements through Rapid Capability Insertion Program (RCIP).  This approach will also be considered for other future Surface Navy Platform Combat System requirements inclusive of Aegis.  Interested parties should continue to monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBiz Opps) website for an Industry Day announcement pertaining to the FY08-FY13 Navy requirements.  The Industry Day is tentatively planned for late July/early August 2007 and will outline the follow-on opportunities for competition with an overview of the technical details of these requirements.  Attendees are encouraged to provide feedback on the requirements discussed d!  uring the event.  Attendee comments from the Industry Day will be considered in the definition of the competitive statement(s) of work (SOW). Notice: See Note 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWCPC) intends to issue a sole-source purchase order to EADS Defense and Security Systems (EADS), Newport South, United Kingdom for the fabrication and delivery of one (1) wet-end connector and one (1) dry-end connector for the MH-60S / Organic Airborne Surface and Influence Sweep (OASIS) tow cable.  This effort is sole source for the following reasons.  EADS is the sole designer and original equipment manufacturer of the MH-60S/OASIS tow cable.  The tow cable is a custom built tow cable with the specific hydrodynamic and acoustic properties of the system as a whole in mind.  As the OEM of the tow cable, only EADS has the in-house resident knowledge to properly fabricate the wet and dry end connectors for the tow cable.  Use of another company to fabricate the connectors may introduce new, or change existing parameters that may induce unacceptable error into the OASIS system and the MH-60S helicopter.  Failure to have a pr!  operly functioning tow cable could result in significant damage to the OASIS and maybe even loss of the MH-60S.  Therefore it is imperative that this effort is awarded to EADS immediately.

This software also allows for realistic training situations via the DCTMS.   Contractor support is required for the fabrication of shipboard mounting system for the DCTMS to facilitate the use of DCAMS software by U.S. Navy damage control personnel.  The procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Thomas Associates is the only company that has developed a DCTMS mounting and bracket syst!  em that has been approved for use aboard U.S. Navy ships.  These are the only parts that have been shock qualified and shocks tested and thus are qualified and approved for Navy shipboard use.  The parts will be installed on Navy ships during current damage control equipment upgrades, (i.e. an integral part of a new shipboard damage command control system). Thomas Associates, Inc. is the only known vendors of these critical parts.  The Navy does not have the fully delineated part specifications that would allow independent fabrication.  All parts are required ASAP as shipboard damage control upgrades are currently on going. Delivery will be to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL 32407-7001.

A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

This pulsed YAG laser and matching pulsed dye laser and associated hardware is required for laser-induced fluorescence experiments for the NASA Hypersonics program, the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle program and the NASA Engineering and Safety Center.  These systems will be used for combustion studies and studying external aerodynamic hypersonic flows and are designed to work in conjunction with existing planar laser-induced fluorescence measuring systems.   The required components must work in parallel with existing units, simultaneously, and operate in an identical fashion to maintain test reliability and to perform two-laser, two-camera thermometry experiments which require two identical lasers.  NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Newport Corporation, Irvine, CA, who is the only known responsible source. To acquire comparable equipment from any other vendor would result in equipment incompatibility, thus leading to additional costs and scheduling delays, and would result in unacceptable errors in temperature measurements.  Authority for the Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition is provided by FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (PL 104-106, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as amended by PL 109-163, Section 1443 of the FY 2006 National Defense Authorization Act). This authority is available for use in acquiring commercial items not exceeding $5.5 million.  Newport Corporation is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements under the authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.

<DESC>The purpose of this project is to enhance, extend, document, and integrate the PNW FIA Information Management system for collecting, quality checking, analyzing, and delivering forest inventory data for Alaska.  The existing system is both complex and extensive, including a variety of national and regional components.  Newly developed features and processes must be carefully integrated with the existing system utilized for the Alaska, Oregon, Washington, and California inventories.
Task Summary
1. Alaska Periodic Inventory Compilation Metadata
Develop metadata documenting the existing Microsoft Access-based system for storing and compiling Alaska periodic inventories conducted from 1995 through 2003.  Information should be presented in a database format which can be easily queried, as well as a printable manual format.  The documentation must capture changes in inventory attributes over time.
2. Growth, Removals, and Mortality Reporting System
Develop a system for computing and reporting forest growth, removals and mortality based on previous periodic and current annual inventories for Alaska.  This will require a thorough understanding of existing periodic and annual inventory methods, data, and computational systems.  Existing systems include national and regional components utilizing various database formats (e.g. Oracle and Microsoft Access) and programming languages (e.g. PL/SQL, VBA, FORTRAN).  The system will be used to estimate growth, removals, and mortality for Alaska for at least the next ten years.
3.PNW FIA System Integration
Enhancements and updates required in tasks 1 and 2 above will necessitate changes throughout the PNW FIA Information Management system.  Newly developed components and processes must be carefully integrated with the Program-wide IM system.  The following are examples of existing system components that will likely be affected:
a)  PNW Field Data Manager system.  Data quality checks will need to be added and updated.  Tables are to be migrated from Access to Oracle.
b)  PNW field data loading system.  The system must be updated to accommodate changes in national and regional inventory requirements.
c)  Field edit review system.  The system must be updated as needed to include Alaska data.
d) Data Anomaly Resolution System (DARSy).  Populate the system with anomalies discovered during the development process.  Update the system as required for effective reporting of anomalies.

Items a, b, and c are related Microsoft Access databases with extensive VBA code.  They share a single set of MS Access tables.  Item d is composed of a complex Microsoft Access user interface to Oracle tables, with additional PL/SQL functions and scheduled Oracle processes
The solicitation will be available on or about July 25, 2007 on FEDBIZOPPS.

<b><u>Meteorological and Hydrological Service Modernization Project.</u></b>
The Grantee, the Meteorological and Hydrological Service of the Republic of Croatia (MHS), invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a meteorological and hydrological service modernization feasibility study in Croatia.  

As a consequence of spacious mountainous areas with high precipitation and the presence of a wide valley of lowland watercourses, over 15% of Croatia's inland territory is subject to frequent flooding.  The low-lying part of Zagreb area, the Croatian capital, is occasionally flooded by the Sava River, while the upper portion of the city is hit by flash floods originating in storm torrents from the Medvednica Mountains.  Split, Rijeka, ?ibenik and Dubrovnik are also subject to frequent flash floods.  As a result of these conditions, the MHS of the Republic of Croatia was given the responsibility of developing a comprehensive plan for the modernization of the national meteorological and hydrological observational networks and for modernization of other weather, water and environmental monitoring and forecasting infrastructure.  In an effort to protect its citizens and tourism-reliant economy, the MHS is looking to develop meteorological and hydrological monitoring capability to forecast and react appropriately to impending weather conditions.  

The establishment of an effective national system for forecasting environmental crises and the ability to respond to those crises are major concerns for any country as it tries to guarantee national security and stability.  Adverse weather, flooding activity and environmental problems cost the Croatian economy around $218 million annually, severely impacting the quality of life of its citizens and economic development.  The impact of flooding in recent years illustrates the need for modernizing Croatia's environmental monitoring and forecast capabilities, including improved sensing systems and reliable high-speed data communications infrastructure.  Accurate weather and flood forecasting is especially important for Croatia because of its strategic location on the Balkan Peninsula and its extended coastline on the Adriatic Sea, which is well known for the rapid onset of very dangerous weather conditions, and the mountainous terrain which exacerbates flooding conditions.  As a result of the lack of appropriate operational monitoring, warning and forecasting systems, weather conditions continue to cause destruction and disrupt the economy.

The MHS's mission is to produce and provide meteorological and hydrological information, particularly the environmental forecasting services and warnings necessary to: (1) ensure the safety of its citizens; (2) permit the efficient operations of the nation's commerce; (3) preserve the nation's natural resources; and (4) permit the efficient operations of rescue, protection and civil defense.  The MHS is tasked with developing a comprehensive plan to modernize the national meteorological and hydrological observational networks and to modernize other weather, water and environmental monitoring and forecasting infrastructure.  In 2005 MHS had a budget of roughly ?10 million and employed over 400 people.  Recognizing the deficiencies of the current system, the MHS has taken steps towards upgrading its meteorological and hydrological infrastructure by liaising with the National Electricity Company for the establishment of lightning monitoring system.  The installation of a network of additional air quality observation (about 10 new stations), as well as upgrading and filling the gaps of hydrological network, are currently being considered. 

The MHS believes the most immediate benefits can be gained by implementing an integrated network of hydrological and meteorological systems consisting of a:  warning system; environmental monitoring system; Doppler weather radar network; lightning location network; upper air sounding network; surface hydrological and meteorological observation network; and associated analysis and forecasting systems.  Together, these systems would form an integrated Croatian National Monitoring, Nowcasting and Forecasting system which, in conjunction with Croatian information and communication systems, could provide timely alerts and warnings to the government, industry and the general population.  Such a system would allow the MHS to better support its sister meteorological and hydrological agencies in the region and allow Croatian emergency personnel to anticipate and respond to weather-related events.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the study would analyze the modernization and expansion requirements of the capabilities of Meteorological and Hydrological Service of the Republic of Croatia. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $495,760 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: <b><a href=https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp>https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp</a></b>.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <u>4:00 P.M. Local Time</u>, <u>September 10, 2007</u> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the uer of DELL laptop computers. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirement, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. Embassy Baghdad has identified the DELL laptop computers as a key component of the DoD networking system. This equipment is reliable and expendable supply is available. It is also supportable by on-site staff. The purchase is for DoS staff working in a DoD forward base. This purchase is authorized by a formal MOA between COM and DoD. As this is a brand name only justification, any substitution would impact operations by causing the Embassy to spend more money on training, parts, and equipment inventoryl. It would also require reengineering of Defense networks to support non-standard equipment. In the Iraq war environment, it is essential to maintain compatible systems.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is soliciting contractual support to provide a wide range of technical and support services required for the proper care and use of laboratory animals for NIH animal programs.  The NIH is one of the world's largest biomedical research organizations and is the focal point for US Government health research initiatives. It is comprised of 30 different categorical  Institutes and Centers (ICs) which conduct research in a variety of scientific disciplines including molecular biology, immunology and infectious disease, hematology and tissue transplantation, genetics, physiology, neurology, virology, bacteriology, pharmacology/toxicology, metabolism, biochemistry, cardiology, ophthalmology, dermatology, and dentistry.  

Twenty-two ICs have laboratory animal programs providing research support for NIH intramural scientists.  NIH laboratory animal programs involve the use of approximately 575,000 square feet of space located primarily in twenty-six buildings on the Bethesda campus and thirteen buildings at the NIH Animal Center in Poolesville, MD.  Remote facilities include four leased facilities in Rockville and Gaithersburg and two Government owned facilities in Baltimore, MD.  All NIH animal programs and facilities comply with applicable laboratory animal regulations, guidelines and standards, and are accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC).  

The purpose of this acquisition is to provide a wide range of technical and support services required for the proper care, use and humane treatment of laboratory animals to any NIH IC animal program.  Functions include:  veterinary medicine, animal care and husbandry, veterinary and research technical support, data management, cage and environment sanitation, routine maintenance of animal care equipment, animal transportation, logistical and clerical support.  Support will be provided to projects involving a full range of biomedical research and scientific disciplines.  Continuous high quality animal care shall be provided as set forth in the applicable animal welfare regulations, standards and guidelines.  Animals must be maintained under carefully controlled conditions to minimize research variables and allow the accurate interpretation of laboratory results.  Consequently, it is essential that animal colonies be properly maintained to avoid any situation or condition that might unnecessarily adversely affect animal health and ongoing research.  The Contractor shall maintain strict adherence to all applicable Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).

This is a competitive procurement using full and open competition.  Multiple, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity, task order type contracts are anticipated.  The contracts are expected to be awarded for one sixty (60) month base period.  Individual task orders containing options are expected. The procurement action is partially set-aside for small businesses. Tasks of low to moderate technical complexity with an IGCE of $250,000 or less will be set aside for small businesses. Tasks of low to moderate technical complexity with an IGCE of $100,000 or less will be set aside for 8(a) businesses.

Twenty-two ICs have laboratory animal programs providing research support for NIH intramural scientists.  NIH laboratory animal programs involve the use of approximately 575,000 square feet of space located primarily in twenty-six buildings on the Bethesda campus and thirteen buildings at the NIH Animal Center in Poolesville, MD.

<DESC>The Veteran's Affairs - I.T. Acquisition Center has a requirement for a software license agreement for  McAfee Anti-Virus and Anti-Spy ware and Anti-Spam protection, software for a period of one base year, with one option year.  The software is currently deployed throughout the VA Infrastructure. To install another type of license, new hardware will be required as well as testing to determine viability on the VA network before deployment is started. The criticality of the architecture makes it necessary to test all major applications before deployment begins. Some sites will require as long as three to six months time frame for testing of new applications. The VA is almost at the end-of-life cycle for the Anti-virus, Anti-spy, Anti-spam protection to effectively secure the VA network.  New hardware would be cost prohibitive. The new licensing is required on or before 08/31/2007. McAfee software is designed to control viruses and spam on the second largest network in the federal government. The estimated value of purchasing the software licensing agreement was estimated at $1,933,960.00.  This action is to justify the use of a Brand Name Description as described in FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description. McAfee licenses can be purchased from a number of agent contractors at a variety of prices. This product will be solicited utilizing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Scientific and Engineering Workstation Procurement (SEWP) IV contracting system as specified by VA directive. Responses to this notice must be in writing and must be received by 12:00 pm CST on July 11, 2007. Third party firms will be considered only if responding with clear and convincing evidence that the Government will avoid additional cost of ownership and production will not be affected if non-McAfee software is purchased. The determination to open brand name competition based on responses is solely within the discretion of the Government. No additional synopsis information will be published, and a solicitation will only be issued to SEWP IV contract holders, regardless of the Government's brand name decision. Responses should be emailed to Allison.Cox-Rudick@va.gov or faxed to 512-326-6028.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS - This is not a Notice of Solicitation.  The Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA), Office of Business Services (OBS) Field Acquisition Department (FAD) is seeking Statements of Capabilities from industry for an anticipated requirement to provide environmental characterization and remediation services at designated corrective action sites at various locations where underground nuclear testing or related support activities have occurred under the cognizance of the NNSA Nevada Site Office (NSO).  Sites where the NSO has responsibility for are located at the Nevada Test Site (NTS), portions of the Tonopah Test Range, and portions of the Nevada Test and Training Range which is formally the Nellis Air Force Range.  REQUIREMENTS: The contractor must be capable of providing environmental characterization and remediation services for several simultaneous projects at a variety of locations on the sites where NSO has environmental restoration responsibilities.  The services contemplated include: (a) programmatic planning, documentation and management of environmental management activities; (b) assessment/characterization services, in accordance with the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (FFACO) between the NSO, the state of Nevada, and the Department of Defense, Defense Threat Reduction Agency; (c) technical schedule and cost, baseline development, and reporting; (d) regulatory and policy review; (e) database management; (f) field characterization/remediation and laboratory analyses; and (g) public involvement activities.  Required services, including assessment/characterization services, will be in accordance with the FFACO and will be in compliance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Act, appropriate state laws and regulations, as well as applicable DOE Orders and regulations.  POSSIBLE CONTRACT CONSIDERATIONS: We are considering conducting a competitive acquisition using the procedures delineated in FAR Part 15.  The estimated ceiling amount of a potential 5-year contract arrangement is $100,000,000.00.  The estimated need date for contract support to be available under the potential acquisition is July 2008.  Work is expected to be both on Government sites and at a contractors facility.  It is anticipated that as part of this requirement, the successful contractor will be required to have/maintain an office in the Las Vegas metropolitan area throughout the life of the contract that is adequately staffed to provide support in accordance with the Performance Work Statement (PWS).   Work under the potential contract will likely involve providing systems engineering, and technical direction, preparing specifications or work statements, evaluating products or services, and having access to proprietary information of other firms.  Therefore, the Organizational Conflict of Interest restrictions delineated in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 9.5 will apply.  As a result of the sensitive nature of the NNSA mission and the ongoing work at some of the potential sites, the successful contractor, and their subcontractors or team members, will be required to have an affirmative determination of Foreign Ownership, Control and Clearance (FOCI).  In addition, many contractor personnel performing on the contract will be required to have and maintain DOE L or Q level security clearances.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 562910, Environmental Remediation Services, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  ROAD AHEAD:  We are in the preliminary stages of developing an acquisition strategy.  To help us determine industry interest, capability and whether the proposed acquisition can be set-aside for small business concerns, interested firms are asked to submit a Statement of Capabilities that addresses th e following: 1) Statement to whether your firm has a current affirmative Foreign Ownership, Control and Influence (FOCI) determination, the date the determination was rendered, and the current level of security clearance possessed by your firm;  2) Statement of whether your firm is classified as a Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, HUBZone Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business in the 562910 NAICS code; 3) overview of your technical capabilities in each of the above stated functional areas; 4) summary description of relevant past 5 years of experience with each of the functional areas including the magnitude, complexity and criticality of the work performed; 5) description of company resources to include your ability to manage multiple projects in a variety of different functional areas, working environments, locations and durations; how you plan to acquire and retain the necessary resources; your approach in establishing teaming/subcontracting arrangements for acquiring labor resources; and your ability to perform at least 50 percent of the projected contract work in-house.  Statements of Capabilities are to be limited to 30 pages, excluding the transmittal page.  The Statements of Capabilities submitted by interested firms will be evaluated by NNSA representatives as part of the Governments market research to assist in developing the appropriate acquisition approach to contractually satisfy the program requirements, including but not be limited to, the type of contract arrangement best suited for satisfying the program needs and the extent of possible participation by small business concerns. NSO is establishing an Internet web site specifically for this acquisition for the purposes of posting associated documents such as a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS), the FFACO, and other acquisition related documents. Information will be posted as it becomes available at the following address: www.nv.doe.gov/.  DOE Orders referenced in the draft PWS can be accessed at: www.directives.doe.gov.  Although the details have not been definitized at this time, an Industry Day is being considered for this acquisition.  The purpose of such an Industry Day would be to provide the Government acquisition team a forum to present the possible approaches being considered for accomplishing the acquisition as well as obtaining feedback and exchanging ideas with industry. Further information will be provided at a later date via the acquisition web site provided above and/or through another IIPS announcement.  Businesses responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must submit their responses via the DOE IIPS at http://e-center.doe.gov no later than 4:30 P.M. Mountain Time, July 24, 2007.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, and management capability of such offerors to perform this type of work.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside is warranted or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted. The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region and National Park Service, Lake Mead National Recreation Area (LMNRA) have a requirement for a planning study to determine whether a Lake Mead - Hoover Dam Welcome Center is feasible, and if so what size it should be, where it should be located, and how it should be organized and operated.  The facility would be a multi-use "gateway" to the Lake Mead LMNRA and to Hoover Dam that would enhance tourism by orienting visitors to recreational, educational, and sightseeing opportunities in the LMNRA and at Hoover Dam.  The facility would likely serve as a hub for various modes of transportation providing access to points in the LMNRA and to Hoover Dam, and would provide parking for visitors and tour buses.  The welcome center would be designed to achieve LEED (Silver or greater) certification and to fit harmoniously with the natural landscape and existing facilities in the area.  Site selection is an important element in achieving LEED certification. The study will include determining problems and needs; formulating alternatives; developing operational plans, estimating construction and operation costs; assessing non-federal funding sources; preparing business plans to show self-sustaining operation; evaluating alternative energy sources; and conducting evaluations such as a fatal flaw analysis, a multi-attribute matrix analysis, and a value analysis.  Interim reports and presentations, as well as a final report will be required to document the study results.  A draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) is available upon request to interested parties for review and comment.   Firms interested in participating in the above procurement are invited to submit capability statements in response to this request. The capabilities package submitted should demonstrate the firm's ability, capability, and responsibility to perform the principal components of work listed above.  Packages should include the following information:  (1) Firm's name, address, telephone and fax numbers, business size and type ( 8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran, Small Business, Large Business, etc.), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number; (2) Demonstration of the firm's experience shown by providing a list of similar studies completed within the past five years including, project titles,  location of studies, detailed descriptions of the studies performed, dollar values, contract award and completion dates, and client's name and telephone number; (3) Estimated performance period to complete the welcome center study and prepare the report; and (4) Commercial Terms and Conditions including payment provisions and intervals.  Capability statements are to be submitted not later than August 3, 2007. All responses to this Sources Sought notice shall be provided to Denise Colwell/LC-3111, Contract Specialist, P. O.  Box 61470, Boulder City, NV 89006-1470 or via e-mail dcolwell@lc.usbr.gov.  Questions or requests for the draft SOO may be submitted to Jennalyn Schilke, (702) 293-8404, or email at JSCHILKE@lc.usbr.gov.  When it is determined that a formal solicitation will be issued, a pre-solicitation notice will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities web site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is issuing this Sources Sought Notice to determine if there is an adequate number of interested SBA certified 8(a) firms, HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business concerns capable of providing multi-media services.  These services have historically been set-aside and awarded exclusively to small business concerns.

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences has embarked on a proactive effort to promote several new initiatives as well as the long-standing and successful bio-medical research programs. Promotional material design is underway, and many of the supporting design concepts are being created with the support of multi-media contractors.  A critical component of an effective NIEHS promotional effort hinges on an in-depth understanding of the initiatives and demonstrated ability, by the multi-media contractor, for providing services and  producing products that successfully communicate highly technical science and public health programs to both scientific and lay public audiences.

The successful contractor will be required to adopt many of the design concepts and styles recently developed for NIEHS and its initiatives, while facilitating a progression of the ?visual identity? in promotional and branding efforts.  To that end the NIEHS requires a contractor capable of providing the personnel, materials, and professional expertise to plan, analyze, and create visual solutions to communication challenges.  The contractor will be tasked with finding the most effective way of conveying a message in print, electronic and film media using a variety of methods such as color, type, illustration photography animation and various print layout techniques. 

The broad categories of the multi-media services include: a. consultations on design or implementation of any task, b. custom photographic services using digital or film as requested, c. providing  graphic design services ranging from simple line drawings to the most complex graphics, d. video projects from concept development to completion and from production to post production, e. meeting and event support to ensure the needs of planners and presenters are met regarding room setup, audio-visual support, options and associated costs and  f. providing a typed monthly report to the NIEHS  that includes a listing of all completed work orders, and shows final costs. 

Responses to this sources sought will be used by the Government to select an appropriate procurement method to fulfill the requirement above. The contract performance period will be for a base year and four one year option periods and is projected to begin on 01 October 2007. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541430. The business size standard is $6.5 million. Interested candidates should include the following in their response:  a. Capability statement, limited to fifteen pages, detailing the qualifications and capability of the firm to complete the type of work described above.  b. Identification and verification of the company as a SBA certified 8(a) firm, HUBZone small busniess, Service-disabled veteran owned small business, Small business, Veteran owned small business, Small disadvantaged business or Women-owned small business. c. The size of the business.   Contractor teaming arrangements are encouraged. This sources sought synopsis should not be construed as a request for proposal from the Government. Submittals will be used for market survey information only. Responses to this sources sought notice shall be mailed to James E. Bryant, Jr. P.O. Box 12874, MD NH-02, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, 27709-5001 or e-mailed to bryant5@niehs.nih.gov .    Telephone responses will not be accepted. Responses must be received no later than Friday 20 July 2007 at 3:00 p.m. EST.  .

<SUBJECT>99 -- Brand Name Justification Nortel Alteon Network Load Balancer Hardware Products
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure ?brand name? Nortel-offered Alteon Network Load Balancer Switch hardware products to support existing Nortel switch infrastructure that is installed and in production for the USPTO?s PTONet infrastructure.  This announcement is considered a ?brand name? justification.  This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG). The acquisition will be conducted utilizing existing Blanket Purchase Agreements for Information Technology products within the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.   USPTO has installed over twenty-five Nortel Alteon Load Balancers to support the PTONet infrastructure. The new hardware will be integrated in the existing Nortel switch infrastructure. It is essential that the USPTO acquire Nortel Alteon Network Load balancer hardware products to maintain the continuity of the network traffic and business processes and maintain compatibility.  Purchase of different hardware will require additional engineering design and training, component testing, extensive lab testing, evaluations, updating Life Cycle Management documentation, and establishing new maintenance contracts, purchasing and maintaining a new spare parts inventory, and conducting training for Network Operations staff, etc. which will delay the mission critical project time and increase the costs beyond the budget limits.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Proposed addition of Clocks, Self-Set to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of self-set clocks by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following products to the P/L:

Clocks, Self-Set
6645-00-NIB-0108
6645-00-NIB-0112
6645-00-NIB-0114
6645-00-NIB-0118
6645-00-NIB-0123
6645-00-NIB-0127

Clocks, Self-Set (Logo)
6645-00-NIB-0109
6645-00-NIB-0113
6645-00-NIB-0115
6645-00-NIB-0119
6645-00-NIB-0124
6645-00-NIB-0128

The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY. 
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Self-Set Clocks to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing self-set clocks to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than August 1, 2007 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed product be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

<SUBJECT>Joint Precision Azimuth Sensing Conference Call for Abstracts
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has identified highly accurate but human-portable azimuth sensing as critical to the advancement of targeting and engagement capabilities. Precise location and designation of targets, coupled with precise aiming of weaponry, are crucial for success not only in conventional warfare but in asymmetric and urban conflict, particularly as light-armored and dismounted tactics are required. The key technology for achieving this precision is accurate azimuth and vertical angle sensing by the dismounted spotter and gunner operating under adverse conditions. In order to move forward in the development of this technology, DoD program/project management centers are coordinating their various efforts in order to seek a common solution for a human-portable azimuth and vertical angle measurement (AVAM) device. This announcement is a call for abstracts from the inertial sensing industry, academia, laboratories, and relevant developers that wish to make known to the DoD their ideas, concepts, technologies, experiences, and recommendations toward realization of a human-portable AVAM device. Each abstract submitted in response to this request will be for official use only (FOUO) and will not be shared among other submitters. Submitted abstracts shall not contain classified material. Arrangements can be made for classified material upon request. Furthermore, an abstract submitted in response to this call shall not be construed as a proposal for future developmental work, but only as a communication of information to the DoD. Based on the contents of the abstracts, submitters may be selected to individually and privately present to a DoD-only audience of program/project managers and engineers at the 2007 Joint Precision Azimuth Sensing Conference (JPASC). Other JPASC presenters/participants will be excluded from the individual presentations in order to maintain a level of confidentiality with respect to the potentially proprietary information of the presenter. Again, presentations shall not contain classified material. ABSTRACTS Submitted abstracts are at liberty to discuss some or all of the following issues related to human-portable AVAM technology: - technology solution(s), current and potential - accuracy considerations relevant for targeting and weapon aiming - setup/alignment time - suitability for difficult military environments including dismounted operations and weapon mounting - for applications in both GPS allowed and GPS denied environments - weight/size/power considerations - unit production cost considerations Of particular interest are novel and innovative approaches toward improving the current state-of-the-art. However, the contents of abstracts should correspond with what the submitters would present at the 2007 JPASC if selected. For purposes of guiding and focusing discussion, a preliminary list of desirable AVAM performance characteristics or goals follows: Near Term Performance Goals Key Parameter Azimuth Accuracy plus or minus 4 mils PE (see note below) Vertical Angle Accuracy plus or minus 2 mils PE (see note below) Orientation Angle Pitch: plus or minus 500 mils (approx. 30 deg) Bank: plus or minus 270 mils (approx. 15 deg) Slew Rate 30 degrees per second Set up Time less than 180 seconds Operational Temperature minus 40C to plus 70C Shock 40g per 11 ms Vibration MILSTD 810 min integrity Volume less than or equal to 50 cu in Weight less than or equal to 4.0 lbs Power less than or equal to 10 W Average Unit Production TBD Cost at FY07 dollars Long Term Performance Goals Key Parameter Azimuth Accuracy plus or minus 1 mil PE (see note below) Vertical Angle Accuracy plus or minus 1 mil PE (see note below) Orientation Angle Pitch: plus or minus 1511 mils (approx. 85 deg) Bank: plus or minus 500 mils (approx. 30 deg) Slew Rate 1000 degrees per second Set up Time less than 1 second Operational Temperature minus 40C to plus 70C Shock 2000g per 1.5 ms at weapon fire Vibration MILSTD 810 min integrity Volume lest than or equal to 0.25 cu in Weight less than or equal to 0.2 lbs Power less than or equal to 250 mW Average Unit Production TBD Cost at FY07 dollars Note: PE is defined as the magnitude of a deviation from a statistic that will be exceeded with probability of 0.50, or on half the occasions. For a normal distribution it is 0.6745 times the standard deviation. Azimuth capability must be achievable between 60 deg N/S Lat. Abstract submissions should be limited to one page in Microsoft Word format. A single-page cover letter should accompany the abstract. Submissions must be unclassified. Submissions will not be shared among the other submitters/participants. The abstract and cover letter should be submitted both electronically as an email attachment and in hard copy form to: Ms. Karin Chandler Coordinator, JPASC 2007 Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC Crane) Code 6062 Bldg. 3395 300 Highway 361 Crane, IN 47522-5001 Email: karin.chandler@navy.mil Electronic submissions of abstracts are due by 20 July 2007. Submitters will be sent email confirmation of receipt of their submittals. Submitters selected for presentation at the 2007 JPASC will be subsequently notified. CONFERENCE PRESENTATIONS If selected, presenters should describe their potential, recent, or ongoing developmental efforts in the area of human-portable AVAM, consistent with their abstracts. Presentation of late breaking results and work in progress is especially encouraged. Presentations will be limited to 30 minutes plus 15 minutes for questions. There may also be an opportunity for breakout sessions where presenters may be invited for in-depth discussions on their topic at the request of one or more of the government participants.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Vector Network Analyzer
<DESC>It is the intent of the U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA Acquisition & Grants Office, to negotiate on a sole source basis with AB Millimetre, for award of a contract to provide one each of a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA).  The contact will provide a VNA for developing and testing polarimeter elements and phase switches at operating frequencies of up to 1 THz with the ability to measure ~1-10 scale models at 11 GHz.  To fully characterize the components a vector network analyzer (VNA) working in these frequency ranges is required.  The polarimeter will also require beam forming elements to control the propagation of e.m. radiation thru the optical system of the instruments that will use NIST?s polarimeters.  The side-lobes of the beam forming elements in both co- and cross-polar must be measured to better than ~-90 db accuracy which requires that the VNA have a dynamic range much better than -90 db.  With the losses expected for free-space set-up for such tests NIST needs a system with dynamic range better than -140 db.  In addition, the VNA must have an option, scalar feeds for the launch of the source radiation into the beam forming elements under test.  The VNA shall be received within 120 days upon receipt of an order.
 
The three essential salient characteristics that are only available from AB Millimetre are the following;

1.	Operation up to 1 THz
2.	Dynamic range in excess of -140 db
3.	Option of scalar feeds for free space operation up to 500 GHz

<SUBJECT>A -- Notice of Opportunity for Collaboration ACUTE LIVER FAILURE STUDY GROUP MULTICENTER CLINICAL TRIALS OF NOVEL THERAPEUTICS AND DIAGNOSTICS
<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks collaborations with Industry to provide novel therapeutic agents, diagnostic markers and devices for use in NIH-sponsored multi-center clinical trials in patients with acute liver failure. 

Introduction:

Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare condition which impacts more than 2,000 individuals annually in the United States.  ALF often affects young people and carries a high morbidity and mortality rate (80%).  There is no accepted treatment for this critical illness; in nearly 30% of cases liver transplantation may be performed.  Causes of ALF include acetaminophen toxicity, prescription drug idiosyncracy, viral hepatitis and several genetic diseases.  Further studies are needed to improve the current understanding of ALF?s overall pathogenesis and to develop new therapies for the overall condition of liver failure. Treatments for specific causes of ALF might also lead to improved outcomes for patients with ALF.  

The NIDDK funded Acute Liver Failure Study Group (ALFSG) includes 22 clinical centers and a data coordinating center.  Among the achievements of the ALFSG is an ongoing registry of more than 1,200 cases of ALF, a large clinical database that includes serum, plasma, urine, DNA and tissue samples.  The ALFSG has recently completed a clinical trial using N-acetylcysteine or placebo for the treatment of ALF not caused by acetaminophen; the results are currently being analyzed.  New clinical trials would complement the current work of the group and could be used to explore new, targeted therapies and diagnostics for these critically ill patients.  For further information concerning the ALF Study Group, visit www.acuteliverfailure.org. 

Study Goals:

The ALFSG is interested in conducting clinical trials to significantly improve the outcomes of ALF patients including:
?	Use of devices to reduce body temperature to determine whether mild hypothermia can improve the outcome of patients with acetaminophen-induced liver failure, the most common cause of ALF in the United States.  Experimental and clinical data support the premise that mild hypothermia may improve outcomes in ALF by preventing cerebral edema and its complications; however controlled trials will be necessary to demonstrate efficacy and to ensure that there are no unrecognized safety issues with these devices.  
?	Use of recombinant factor VIIa to determine its effects on the severe alterations in clotting observed in patients with ALF.
?	Use of nucleoside analogues for patients with severe hepatitis B. 
?	Other potential trials directed toward new treatments for ALF.  For example, inhibitors of apoptosis might have merit in this population where rapid cell death and failure to regenerate new hepatocytes are defining features.  Those seeking initial data or pilot studies as proof of principle will be considered for collaborations. 
?	The availability of important bio-samples (serum, plasma, urine and DNA as well as detailed de-identified data) offers an opportunity for innovative research into the genetics, pathogenesis or outcomes of this unique and important patient population. 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Collaborative arrangements may be either Clinical Trial Agreements or Cooperative Research and Developments Agreements (CRADAs) pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), as appropriate.  Clinical Trial Agreements and CRADAs are agreements designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories. They are not grants, and not contracts for the procurement of goods/services. The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a Clinical Trial or CRADA collaborator.  Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort.  The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration.  The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and make contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA.

Capability Statements: The Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement will be reviewed by a Selection Committee.  The Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their Capability Statements.  The Capability Statement should not exceed ten (10) pages of narrative (not including appendices) and should address all of the following selection criteria:

1.	The proposed preparation or device must have been tested in Phase I trials in humans.
2.

3.	The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the laboratory test agents or devices in a timely manner for the duration of the study.  
4.	A description of laboratory tests that are needed including assays and required amount of specimens, to determine specific biomarker levels along with appropriate methods for performing.
5.	A description of other core facilities and interactions with core facilities that are needed.  
6.	A description of the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.
7.	The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator.  The specifics of the proposed outcome measures and the proposed support should include but not be limited to treatment and evaluation of acute liver failure, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, or other resources that would contribute to the conduct of the commercial development.  
8.	If appropriate, specific funding commitment to support the advancement of scientific research.
9.	Must agree to have their preparation used in the above-mentioned ALFSG-developed protocols which will be conducted by ALFSG and will have data collection and analysis performed by the ALFSG Data Coordinating Center.
10.	Must provide IND/IDE sponsor of the ALFSG studies with cross-reference access to a US FDA filing that contains the chemistry, manufacturing and controls information for the drug substance and drug product or device Mater File.

<OFFADD>Department of Energy, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (DOE Contractor), Industrial Partnerships & Commercialization, 7000 East Avenue L-795, Livermore, CA, 94550, UNITED STATES
<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY High Power Electrostatic Generator/Motor
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
High Power Electrostatic Generator/Motor

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to participate in the development of and/or license a new type of electrostatic generator/motor with a wide variety of possible applications. 

Background:  A novel electrostatic (E-S) generator/motor has been developed in the course of improving electromechanical battery (flywheel energy-storage) technology for the bulk storage of electricity. Electromagnetic-type generator/motors employed in present-day flywheel energy storage systems fell short of meeting the low parasitic losses and low capital cost requirements associated of bulk energy storage systems.  To overcome these limitations a new configuration of the E-S generator/motor was developed and its performance was validated by computer simulation. Possible applications of this E-S motor are broader than the purpose for which it was developed.

Description:  This electrostatic (E-S) generator/motor operates through the time-variation of the capacity of an electrically charged condenser to generate AC voltages and/or mechanical torque.  The output of the generator is such that it can take advantage of the development of high-voltage solid-state electronic components now coming into wide use in the electrical utilities.  

Advantages:  Previous E-S generator/motors have been limited by design factors.  The unique design features of this technology include a novel configuration and materials that improve its performance and reduce its fabrication cost as compared to previous systems.  The resultant design is  light weight, simple, efficient, and intrinsically compatible with high-voltage transmission-line voltages.

Some Potential Applications: 
?	Flywheel-based energy-storage systems
?	Space satellites
?	Wind-power and other alternative energy turbine systems 

Development Status:  Preliminary design studies and extensive computer simulations have been performed to validate the new concepts involved.    A laboratory prototype has not been built.

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at: http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's  new electrostatic generator/motor technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).   Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Quarterly the Policy and Oversight office must submit to DHS the spreadsheet, along with other pertinent location use information. Other pertinent information would be, but not be limited to, energy audits, renewable energy projects, and disaster surge personnel or other increased usage at a location.
 
Currently FEMA has over one hundred and fifteen (115) utility meters at twelve (12) program offices throughout the continental United States.   This project will be a demonstration project for remote monitoring, processing of information of from between 30-50 meters. This number is expected to increase as certain proposed new FEMA locations come on line, and DHS also mandates that even disaster facilities, where FEMA pays the utilities, are required to report utility information.

The Project will utilize technology and online learning models as well as interpersonal meetings to provide motivation, guidance, and support for the desired outcomes of finding employment, increasing wages, receiving a promotion, entering a degree or certificate program, or starting a business and report the outcomes to the Women?s Bureau.

<DESC>The following are questions and the answer to those questions that our office received for solicitation FSIS-27-B-07:  


QUESTION 1.  We received your solicitation for a Lab Blender, but we were hoping to receive a little more detail as to the type of blender you will require.  We were confused by your reference to a bag to hold 3,000 ml of liquid.  Are you looking to agitate the bag in order to keep materials in suspension? 

ANSWER:  

Yes, the contents of the bag must be agitated for a specific amount of time in order to attain a homogenous mixture of food and liquid particles. 


QUESTION 2.   I am contacting you in relation to your tender for a lab blender.  We would like to submit a tender with our new automated homogenization system that we designed to compete with the lab blender and would appreciate the tender documents or address that we should send the quote to.

ANSWER:  USDA FSIS is only requesting a quote for a lab blender that meets the specification requirements.  The address to where your quote is to be submitted is stated in the solicitation FSIS-27-B-07.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:

The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in collaboration with the trustees for the Chalk Point oil spill has a requirement for spat-on-shell Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica).  Contractor shall provide live, healthy spat-on-shell Eastern Oysters by setting larvae onto native oyster shell only. 

SCOPE OF WORK:

Setting, Rearing, Transportation And Placement Of Hatchery Seed Spat-On-Shell Of American Oyster (Crassostrea Virginica) For Chalk Point Oyster Reef Sanctuary Project, Maryland.

Introduction

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is the lead administrative natural resource trustee for natural resource restoration arising out of the April 7, 2000, pipeline rupture at Pepco?s Chalk Point Generating Facility in Aquasco, Maryland.  The spill released about 140,000 gallons of oil into the Patuxent River and associated shoreline areas.  The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 authorizes designated Natural Resource Trustees (Trustees) to collect damages from the responsible parties in order to restore the injured natural resources.   Along with NOAA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Maryland Department of the Environment, and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources are Trustees.

Pursuant to the terms of the Consent Decree settling the claims of the United States and state of Maryland for natural resource damages (United States v. Potomac Electric Power Co.), monies were provided to the Trustees to undertake specific restoration projects. One of those projects entailed creation of a five-acre oyster sanctuary known as the Chalk Point Oyster Reef Sanctuary Project. The oyster sanctuary is intended to partially compensate for lost ecological services to fish, shellfish, benthic communities, and birds. An entity within NOAA, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Restoration Center (RC), has been designated as the lead implementing trustee for this project on behalf of the Trustees 

The project consists of a site within the Patuxent River with suitable bottom known as Kitt?s Marsh in the general area between Broomes Island and Sheridan Point. The approximately 5-acresite site was planted with about a 4-inch layer of dredged oyster shell and fines in the summer of 2003 to prepare it to receive spat-on-shell hatchery oyster seed.  The site was seeded with 10 million spat-on-shell oyster seed in June of 2004, and monitoring has occurred since.  Monitoring has shown relatively low initial survival of planted oysters, with stabilization over the last year to a density of 58 per meter squared, with little fouling and minimal disease detected.  Mean size of the single year class of oysters was 77mm in October of 2006.  A minimal amount of natural spatset occurred during the summer of 2006.

Based on these current density levels, and the desire to have the sanctuary be made up of multiple year classes of oysters, the Trustees have determined that it is appropriate to proceed with the planned second seeding in year 4 rather than wait until the initially presumed need for re-planting in year 5.  In a slight deviation from the original plan, the Trustees have also determined that it is advantageous to spread the remaining planting total out over a number of years, to further improve the year class diversity on the site, and to bet-hedge against potential future adverse environmental events. 

Statement of Need

Eyed larvae will be purchased or spawned by the contractor and set on shell in an appropriate oyster setting facility.  Following setting and tank grow-out, the spat-on-shell will be transported to the shelled site and planted on the bottom throughout the 5-acre site.  The required deliverable is 2 million spat-on-shell per year for each of 5 consecutive years. See below for base and option periods.

This Scope of Work is limited to that portion of the NRDA Chalk Point Oyster Restoration Project including the setting, rearing, transport and placement of hatchery seed onto the designated sanctuary site.

Terms

Setting and Rearing of Hatchery Seed
	- The oyster setting facility Technical Contact will provide the NOAA RC Technical Contact a weekly progress report on the setting and growth rates of hatchery seed throughout the sequenced setting and growout periods.
	- Epidemiology samples of 30-35 spat will be collected from each setting batch when the spat attain 7-10 mm in size and sent to the DNR Oxford laboratory for disease analysis.  Disease results shall be made available to the NOAA RC Technical Contact within 10 days from the date samples are received at the laboratory, unless otherwise notified.
	- The maximum desired number of spat per shell is 15.  Any individual shells with spat counts higher than 15 shall be counted as no more than 15 towards the total deliverable.
	- The spat shall be tank-reared or cage-deployed for a period of not less than 2 weeks (three weeks optimally) from settlement prior to removal for transport and seeding.  This is intended to minimize handling and desiccation mortalities, and limit early post settlement mortality.
	- Oyster setting facility staff will determine the number of spat produced no more than 10 days prior to being planted using methodology approved by the NOAA RC Technical Contact. The NOAA RC Technical Contact shall have the right to be present and to conduct subset counts of spat-on-shell samples prior to transport and planting.

Land Transportation of Hatchery Seed to Planting Vessel
	- Hatchery seed will not be planted until approved by the NOAA RC Technical Contact upon their review of the epidemiology results.
	- The oyster setting facility Technical Contact will provide the NOAA RC Technical Coordinator a minimum notice of 48 hours prior to each planting date.
	

Vessel Transportation and Placement of Hatchery Seed
	- The contractor shall provide for vessel transportation and placement of hatchery seed to the designated sanctuary site (Kitt?s Marsh in the Patuxent River north of Broomes Island).  The vessel will be required to have onboard a light colored tarp and water pump in case their use is needed to reduce desiccation of hatchery seed.
	- NOAA RC in conjunction with MDNR will be responsible for adequately marking the designated planting area with buoys.
	- The Contractor will be responsible for supervising the loading and unloading the spat-on-shell onto the planting vessel, and transporting and planting the hatchery seed onto the designated planting area.  Hatchery seed will be planted in a manner approved by the NOAA RC Technical Contact to obtain an equal distribution of hatchery seed throughout the designated planting area.
	
Deliverables and Schedule

The contractor shall produce, transport and place 2 million American oyster (Crassostrea virginica) spat on shell, to the Kitt?s Marsh oyster sanctuary site.

The first hatchery seed planting shall occur no earlier than no later than September 30, 2007, unless approved by the NOAA RC Technical Contact.  At the discretion of the Government the contractor may be directed to proceed in each subsequent year (2008 through 2011) with planting 2 million American oyster (Crassostrea virginica) spat on shell, to the Kitt?s Marsh oyster sanctuary site between June and September each year.

A report of this project will be submitted to the NOAA RC Technical Contact by October 15, 2007, and each option year thereafter, if exercised.   The information in this report will include, but not limited to, detailed summary of the number and date of larvae received, larvae setting efficiency rates, spat growth rates, epidemiology results, number of spat produced and date planted, and itemization of the costs associated with this project.
