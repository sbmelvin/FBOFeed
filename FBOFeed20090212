<p>2. CONTENT AND FORM OF SUBMISSION: Offerors are required to submit 3 copies of a 3 to 5 page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution.

Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. If the offeror wishes to restrict its white papers/proposals, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b).

Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY, are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS).</p>
<p>5. CLASSIFICATION GUIDANCE FOR WHITE PAPER SUBMISSIONS: AFRL/RIB will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their white paper submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.</p>
<p>6. All Proposers should review the NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM OPERATING MANUAL, (NISPOM), dated February 28, 2006 as it provides baseline standards for the protection of classified information and prescribes the requirements concerning Contractor Developed Information under paragraph 4-105.

<p>All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Frank Hoke, AFRL/RIB, 26 Electronic Parkway Rome, NY 13441-4514.</p>
<p>Electronic submission to Franklin.Hoke@rl.af.mil will also be accepted.</p>
<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) The scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal; (2) The innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques; and (3) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>The exclusive responsibility for evaluation remains with the Government with administrative assistance provided by JAG Technologies. Representatives of the foregoing firm who view the white papers and/or proposals will sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation process and to protect any proprietary information within the proposals. If the offeror desires the cited firm be excluded from access to information contained in its white paper and/or proposal, offeror must so indicate in a letter of transmittal accompanying the document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>The offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility and or network resources to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:</p>
<p>TPOC: Frank Hoke<br />Telephone: (315) 330-3470<br />Email: Franklin.Hoke@rl.af.mil</p>

<p>In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>Item: 0001Maint & Repair of Eq/Miscellaneous Equipment
Description: To obtain contractual services of test and evaluation of NSN: 630-01-359-7462SS, P/N: AGE101000-1 IAW Performance Work Specification dated 12 December 2008.
Supp. Description: This effort is to survey AACE Klaxon RSUs to determine their current condition.  The focus of this effort is to determine if each RSU is:  1.  In need of refurbishment to the new upgraded configuration (with limited repair) before being fully operational, 2.  In need of refurbishment and repair before being a viable operational candidate (no re-engineered components are found to be in nonoperational condition), or 3.  In need of refurbishment, repair, and re-engineering before they would be in fully operational condition.
This effort will include a test/survey plan, conduct of the survey/testing, and a final report documenting the results of the survey.  The test/survey plan will rely heavily on existing RSU operational test procedures, but we will also focus on testing the circuit cards that are part of the RSU since these are the components that would require re-engineering if sufficient quantities are not found to be operational.  
All shipping and packaging costs will be handled by the Government and are not included within the scope of this effort.  This effort is expected to last approximately 3 months.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Safety Research, Protective Technology Branch, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to SRI International for development of electroadhesion device for improving extension ladder stability.</p>
<p>SRI has recently developed the exclusive "know-how" and holds several patent applications for this technology. SRI has developed this technology in part under a contract with the Department of Defense, and the Government has certain rights to the patent pending inventions, currently available for licensing. SRI is an independent, non-profit research institute with rich history of innovation in conducting research and development for government agencies. It will be our advantage to work directly with SRI to develop the EA device prototypes at a minimum cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This procurement is to develop a prototype of an electroadhesion (EA) device for improving extension ladder stability. At this "proof-of-concept" stage, the work will be limited only to improving the ladder stability in environments with simple geometry, i.e., ladder supported by a level surface and leaning on a vertical wall. Based on the NIOSH-specified technical requirements, the vendor will develop a set of EA pads and the associated control circuits. The vendor will also conduct a preliminary testing of the set of EA pads to evaluate their performance on a selected range of surfaces. NIOSH will use the EA devices for further evaluation on extension ladders. The vendor will perform 3 tasks:<br />First, the vendor will develop several design concepts for the EA device and will discuss these concepts with the NIOSH project officer/ principal investigator (PO/PI). The NIOSH PO/PI will assist the vendor's researchers in selecting the design parameters to be considered in the device prototyping process, i.e., the level of adhesion forces, shape and dimensions, housing design, attachment methods and locations. One or two design concepts will be selected for further development and evaluation. <br />Second, for each of the selected designs the vendors will develop two EA device prototypes - one "light-duty" and one "heavy-duty". Once activated, the EA device should be able to engage the ladder at its top or/and bottom support locations by applying forces normal to the support surface, and be able to counteract the shear forces generated during ladder user activity. Based on literature, a shear force of 20 kg is proposed as a goal performance level at each support location (top and/or bottom), however, it is recognized that the EA performance may vary with surface properties and conditions and that smaller forces may also be beneficial to enhance ladder safety.<br />Third, the vendor will conduct a limited program of mechanical testing to characterize the performance of the EA devices. The testing methodology will be discussed and coordinated with the NIOSH PO/PI. The evaluation program may include tests to determine the maximum resistance to normal and shear force during static and dynamic loading on a range of common construction materials, i.e., wood, drywall, brick, concrete, tile. <br /><br />Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Rebecca Mullenax, Purchasing Agent, Reference 000HCCJC-2009-67152, Centers for Disease Control, NIOSH, ATTN: Rebecca Mullenax, MS: GD, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with SRI International, 333 Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo Park, CA 94025-3453 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>NASA intends to award a sole-source contract extension to Honeywell TechnologySolutions, Inc. (HTSI) pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, insupport of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA's GSFC) Flight Projects Directorate.This procurement is to extend the period of performance/effective ordering period ofcontract NNG04DA00C for a period of up to 6-months from April 9, 2009 through October 8,2009. Also, there will be an increase in the Core and IDIQ estimated values in order toallow for the continuation of services, the modification of existing services, and fornew work until the Space Communications Networks Services (SCNS) competitive follow-oncontract is awarded. The contract extension and increase in Core and IDIQ values isnecessary in order to ensure program continuity and critical mission support and to avoidsignificant technical and programmatic impacts to NASA programs. The scope of the existing work encompasses the following functional requirements: Programand Network Management, Planning, Management Reporting/Reviews, Financial Management,maintain and meet Performance Metrics, Property and Logistics Management, ConfigurationManagement and Control, Security Management, Safety and Health Management, QualityAssurance, Environmental Management, Space Network Operations, TDRS Flight Operations,TDRS Console Support, Scheduling/Control/Status, NCCDS Operations, Scheduling ofNon-customer Activities, Service Accounting, Engineering Configuration management,Documentation Maintenance, Facilities Operations and Maintenance, Custodial Services,Facilities Configuration Management and Documentation, SN Security, SN Logistics, WSCAdministrative Computing, Networking, and Telecommunications, System Engineering andDevelopment, Engineering Studies, Mission, Networks Loading, Modeling and Analysis,Requirements Development, Testing, Simulations, and Integration, Hardware and SoftwareDevelopment, Facilities Engineering, Sustaining Engineering, Software Maintenance,Hardware Maintenance, Logistics, Ground Network space Communications Services, satelliteLaser Ranging Network Operations, NASA Integrated Services Network Interface support,Mission Unique Equipment support, Facilities Operations and Maintenance, and AlternateWide Area Network Services. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See note26. HTSI, as the current incumbent, has the in-depth knowledge of Government facilities,networks and systems, management structure and personnel to provide uninterruptedcontinuation of mission critical support. An interruption and restart of the servicescurrently being performed, with a new contractor that is unfamiliar with the existingnetworks, facilities and the specific requirements of the NENS contract, would greatlyjeopardize the success of space exploration goals and valuable on-orbit assets as managedby various NASA directorates. Due to the time and substantial duplication of costsinvolved in procuring and phasing in another contractor, HTSI is considered the onlycontractor that can meet NASA's GSFC needs given the short period of performance for theextension. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 PM. local timeFebruary 27, 2009. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<SUBJECT>Ultrasound-Guided Prostate Brachytherapy System for existing Nucletron MicroSelection HDR
<SOLNBR>NCI-90061-AV
<RESPDATE>022309
<CONTACT>Ashley L. Virts, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Center Research (CCR), Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) plans to procure the brand name Ultrasound-Guided Prostate Brachytherapy System for the existing Nucletron MicroSelectron HDR with Nucletron Corporation; 8671 Robert Fulton Drive; Columbia MD 21046.

This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and under the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements as provided in FAR 13.5019(a)(1).

The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

The Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) of the Cancer Research Center (CCR) treats cancer patients with radiation according to approved clinical protocols. One of the treatment modalities employed by the ROB is brachytherapy.  This employs an advanced, computer controlled device for positioning and moving a radioactive source in a controlled fashion on the government owned MicroSelectron HDR. The ROB intends to launch a new treatment initiative to treat cancer of the prostate with its MicroSelectron HDR utilizing real-time ultrasound guidance for catheter placement. Accurate placement of treatment catheters and reference markers need to be performed under ultrasound guidance so as to avoid critical anatomical structures.  This placement is controlled using a system consisting of a B-mode ultrasound system, a fixation table to maintain proper patient alignment and a stepper system to control catheter insertion.  The system from Nucletron utilizes proprietary hardware and control software and must to be acquired as a package, rather than as individual components.  This system has passed both FDA and NRC approval for use in the clinic.  While the system uses a third party ultrasound machine, it has specially constructed hardware to make it compatible with the government owned treatment planning system and has developed customized software to control and transfer the appropriate information.  Since the mechanics of each ultrasound machine and mechanically controlled stepper are unique, the entire system must be verified for proper operation, as per both FDA and NRC regulations.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), in particular, is highly specific as to the technical requirements for any ancillary device that is used with a medical radioisotope irradiator.

Nucletron is the only known equipment manufacturer of this system and has passed both Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) clearances.  Nucletron is the only provider known to the NCI that can fully meet these requirements.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) intends to negotiate contracts on the basis of Other Than Full and Open Competition IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source.  NRL is conducting a ONR funded program to provide a comprehensive, field-deployable fluid analyzer, capable of analyzing mineral and synthetic based lubricating oil and hydraulic fluid and fuel in a single instrument, to the Autonomic Logistics Program of the US Marine Corps.  This program will capitalize on previous ONR and NRL investment to extend the capability of the existing Portable Fluid Analyzer (PFA).  The PFA incorporates the FluidScan oil condition monitor from Foster Miller and the LaserNet Fines particulate monitor from Lockheed Martin.  Presently, the PFA has the capability of measuring debris size distributions and classifying debris particles greater than 4 micrometers according to wear type or external contamination type, as well as measuring fluid properties such as free and dissolved water, base number, glycol, the presence of incorrect fluids and viscosity.  Each subsystem has to be expanded individually to provide fuel analysis capability in the integrated PFA.  This expansion will add the capability of identifying the fuel type and its usability, which includes identifying and quantifying particulate and biological contamination, quantifying free and dissolved water and identification of the presence of adulterants.  NRL will negotiate with both Lockheed Martin, 1210 Massillon Road, Akron, OH 44315-0001, and Foster Miller, 195 Bear Hill Road, Waltham, MA, 02451, for the award of two separate contracts to achieve this requirement. in support of this program to provide the necessary software and hardware modifications to their subsystems and the PFA.   The Portable Fluid Analyzer is a developmental instrument that analyzes lubricating oil and hydraulic fluid in the field.  It was developed at NRL with ONR funding and contractor support from Lockheed Martin and Foster Miller. The system has been used by deployed Marine forces and other military personnel to assess machinery health and fluid condition.  Continued development of this highly specialized equipment to include a fuel analysis capability is urgently needed to meet operational requirements for equipment deployed in support of theater operations.  The Portable Fluid Analyzer and LaserNet Fines monitor are manufactured by Lockheed Martin and the technology is proprietary to Lockheed Martin.  FluidScan is a developmental oil condition monitor technology that was developed by Foster-Miller.  The technology is proprietary to Foster Miller.   Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm.

<DESC>The purpose of the municipal governance program is to create effective, responsive, democratic, transparent, accountable and gender sensitive municipal governance in Afghanistan.  Through the municipal governance program, USAID will help the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA): (1) clarify the local governance framework; (2) provide responsive policy guidance and assistance to sub-national entities; (3) strengthen the legal, fiscal, economic and service delivery functions of municipalities; and (4) foster greater citizen participation in municipal governance.  As a result of municipal governance assistance, Afghan citizens will know where to turn to for better delivery of services, will understand the responsibilities of local governance leaders, will play an active role in the decision making process and will see local governance structures as legitimate.  To meet these objectives, USAID envisions working in at least 40 municipalities (inclusive of Kabul).

 USAID will be releasing a Request for Proposal in late March.  A pre-proposal conference is tentatively scheduled to be held in Dubai on April 14, 2009.  Details regarding the exact time and location will be released with the Request for Proposal.  Please refrain from contacting any USAID personnel regarding this solicitation.  No further information is available at this time.

<DESC>USAID/Peru will be implementing a program with the overall general purpose to help reduce poverty in targeted areas of Peru through trade-led growth. This activity focuses on linking micro, small, and medium sized enterprises (MSMEs) to new markets where Peruvian businesses potentially can be competitive. The recently signed U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA), for example, will provide thousands of MSMEs a competitive advantage over MSMEs in other countries for lucrative U.S. markets. It is designed to build on the success of the previous ten year program, implemented by Chemonics International, but it also seeks to align with regional economic development initiatives implemented by the Government of Peru and Regional Governments. The objectives of this activity are to: (1) Expand the ESC model in the impoverished Sierra Departments of Peru to improve the competitiveness of MSMEs; (2) Create strategic public-private partnerships to reduce poverty through trade-led growth; and (3) Increase private and public investments in infrastructure and business development services to support market-led economic activities in the targeted regions. 

USAID/Peru will be issuing an RFP for this program.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE is posted to allow the General Services Administration (GSA) the opportunity to announce its intent to solicit for qualified Electrical Contractors for the Switchboard/Switchgear Replacements planned for three U.S. Federal Buildings in Savannah and Brunswick Georgia. The project consists of design and construction services as required for the removal and replacement of the entire switchgear/switchboard assembly in each of three buildings along with all necessary wiring and ancillary equipment, as well as any temporary installations that may be necessary.  The General Contractor is responsible for coordination with local electricity providers for shut downs and start-ups as necessary.  Owner will provide designated periods for when work is to take place.   The address for each of the three Federal Buildings is as follows: Tomochichi FB-CT, located at 125 Bull St., Savannah, Ga. 31401; U.S. Custom House, located at 1-3 East Bay St., Savannah, Ga. 31401; Frank M Scarlett FB, located at 805 Gloucester St., Brunswick, Ga. 31520.

When site visits are conducted at Government installations, the Contractor shall comply with the security requirements of the installation.<BR><BR>4.  EVALUATION RATINGS: <BR><BR>    4.1	Ratings.  The application of a scale of words will be used in conjunction with narrative, to denote the degree to which the proposal has met the standard for criteria evaluation.  For purposes of this solicitation, ratings will consist of words (adjectival method) used in conjunction with narratives.  Ratings will be applied at the criterion and sub-criterion level.  If at any level of indentation an Offers submittal is evaluated as not meeting a minimum requirements stated for a criteria (that is, below the level of Satisfactory), the rating may be included in the rating and narrative assessment at that level and each higher level of indentation.  Therefore, a Marginal or Unacceptable rating at any level may be carried to the criterion level.  The following ratings will be used to evaluate the submitted information.<BR><BR>(i) Outstanding  Information submitted demonstrates offerors potential to significantly exceed performance or capability standards.  The offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated.  Have exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government.  The offerors qualifications exceed the fullest expectations of the Government.  The offeror has convincingly demonstrated that the announcement criteria requirements have been analyzed, evaluated, and synthesized into approaches, plans, and techniques that, when implemented, should result in outstanding, effective, efficient, and economical performance under an awarded contract.  Significantly exceeds most or all announcement criteria requirements.  There is a very high probability of success.<BR><BR>(ii) Above Average - Information submitted demonstrates offerors potential to exceed performance or capability standards.  Have one or more strengths that will benefit the Government.  The areas in which the offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality.  The offerors qualifications meet and slightly exceed requirements.  The submittal contains excellent features that will likely produce results very beneficial to the Government.  The information submitted fully meets all announcement criteria requirements and significantly exceeds many of the announcement criteria requirements.  Disadvantages are minimal.  There is a high probability of success.<BR><BR>(iii) Satisfactory (Neutral)  Information submitted demonstrate offerors potential to meet performance or capability standards.  The information represents an acceptable solution.  Either meets all announcement criteria requirements for the criterion (or sub-criterion) or contains weaknesses in some areas that are offset by strengths in other areas.  A rating of Satisfactory indicates that, in terms of the specific criterion (or sub-criterion), the offeror has a good probability of success, as there is sufficient confidence that a fully compliant level of performance will be achieved.  The submittal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the scope and depth of the announcement criteria requirements.  No significant advantages or disadvantages, the submittal is neutral.  There is a good probability of success.<BR><BR>(iv) Marginal  The submittal is not adequately responsive or does not address the specific criterion (or sub-criterion) of the announcement.  The offerors interpretation of the Governments requirements is superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, or incorrect and therefore could be considered deficient.  The submittal does not meet some of the minimum announcement criteria requirements.  The assignment of a rating within the bounds of Marginal indicates that a mandatory corrective action would be required to prevent significant deficiencies from affecting the overall submittal rating.  The offerors qualifications, plans or approach will likely result in questionable quality of performance, which represents a moderate level of risk to the Government.  There is a low probability of success although the submittal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least acceptable.  There are significant disadvantages.<BR><BR>(v) Unsatisfactory  The submittal fails to meet performance or capability standards.  Announcement criteria requirements can only be met through a major revision and/or changes to the submittal.  There is no reasonable expectation that acceptable performance would be achieved.  The submittal contains many deficiencies and/or gross omissions; fails to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Governments requirements; and/or fails to meet most or all of the minimum announcement criteria requirements. There are very significant disadvantages.<BR><BR>5.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS SYNOPSIS IS TO NOTIFY INDUSTRY OF THE USAF INTENT FOR CONTRACT ACTION AND POSSIBLE GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF OTHER POTENTIALLY QUALIFIED SOURCES AND THEIR SIZE CLASSIFICATIONS (SMALL BUSINESS, LARGE BUSINESS, ETC.) PLEASE DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF A SOLICITATION, AS ONE DOES NOT EXIST.
<p>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), 412th Test Wing, Electronic Warfare Directorate, is seeking offerors with demonstrated expertise and experience to support Test, Operations and Maintenance (TO&amp;M) for the Air Force Electronic Warfare Evaluation Simulator (AFEWES), a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL) Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) facility located at Air Force Plant No. 4, Fort Worth, Texas. The contract will consist of multiple services that are detailed in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS). This requirement is for ALL services identified in the PWS. Any qualified and interested companies responding to this announcement must be able to support all areas. NO partial support responses from industry will be accepted. The Government is seeking only, qualified, experienced sources interested in performing the services identified in the attached PWS.</p>
<p>Anticipated award will be in Q1 FY10 with the performance period to begin 1 Jan 2010. Since the facility inception in 1958, AFEWES simulations have been developed, operated, maintained, and periodically upgraded at the AF Plant 4 location by Lockheed-Martin Aeronautics Company (or its predecessors) under contract to the United States Air Force. AFEWES contains high-fidelity, fully-dynamic background (open-loop) and primary player (closed-loop) T&amp;E resources in the Radio Frequency (RF), Millimeter Wave (MMW), and Infrared (IR) spectral regions. AFEWES simulations represent widely diverse computer and technology levels. All simulations operate in real-time, at real frequency/wavelength. The RF/MMW background player simulation is the Multiple Emitter Generator (MEG). When used autonomously, the MEG provides a dense signal environment for testing passive Electronic Warfare (EW) receivers. When used in conjunction with the Primary Players, the MEG supports multi-spectral T&amp;E and the evaluation of defensive countermeasures effectiveness in a realistically dense battlefield scenario. The RF primary player simulations are high-fidelity Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM), simulations that operate between 0.5 and 18.0 GHz. IR primary player simulations are comprised of multiple red and gray SAM and Air-to-Air Missile (AAM) simulations which include representative hardware, integrated with a flight motion table and target scene projector that operates at correct IR wavelengths. AFEWES simulations support testing throughout all phases of the electronic warfare acquisition cycle for Department of Defense (DoD), foreign military customers, and contractor EW programs. Successful TO&amp;M contract performance requires in-depth knowledge, and hands-on staffing to perform daily testing, operating and maintenance functions. Additionally, technical management of the AFEWES test facility is required.</p>
<p>Firms having an interest, capability and appropriate background are invited to submit particulars of qualification and experience. This solicitation will be solicited in accordance with Air Force Material Command FARS Clause 5352.227-9001, (Jul 1997) Qualification of Offeror under Export-Controlled Restricted Solicitation, which states: This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. Only U.S. Contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC), Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084 (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. Although this synopsis is open to all interested offerors, please be advised of the following: This Program will involve technology acquisitions that have military applications and are subject to Air Force Material Command Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplemental Section 5393, Foreign Disclosure Reviews. In addition, foreign owned or influenced firms and foreign governments will not be allowed to participate.</p>
<p>Responses to this synopsis should include sufficient information for a determination of ability to perform all areas of the required support, as listed above, as part of a qualification package. Potential offerors will be screened for their knowledge, experience and demonstrated ability in the following areas: operating and maintaining the unique capability of the AFEWES legacy system simulators, as well as conducting multiple, simultaneous tests to include planning, conducting, and reporting functions. Offerors must have the capability to operate and maintain the existing AFEWES systems without the use of pre-existing operation and maintenance manuals, as they do not currently exist. The offerors ability to upgrade existing simulators according to latest information will be evaluated as well as their ability to acquire replacement or spare parts for and repair simulators and Special Test Equipment (STE). Critical to this program is the offerors knowledge, capability, and demonstrated performance to develop and/or integrate new simulators and STE into the existing AFEWES architecture as this new equipment becomes available from AFEWES upgrade tasks/contracts. Offerors must be able to immediately operate, without delay from contract award, all AFEWES Infrared and Radio Frequency simulators, including, but not limited to, the Jammer Techniques Simulator, Multi-Emitter Generator, AFEWES Clutter Generator, RF and IR high-fidelity threat simulators and other unique, one-of-a-kind AFEWES test equipment. Offerors must have the in-depth knowledge to prepare, set-up, and conduct tests without delay in all areas of the AFEWES laboratory complex. Offerors must immediately possess the knowledge to perform operation and maintenance for the entire AFEWES facility; including unique computer control systems, simulator cable maintenance, flight motion tables, data collection and analysis equipment, secure communications and data transmission hardware and software and internal/external interfaces. Offerors must be capable of integrating Government Furnished Equipment into applicable AFEWES simulators and configuring this equipment for Open Air Range data input, processing, and operations. Because of the nature of EW testing, and the technical characteristics of the simulators, the successful offeror will be required to have as a minimum, a secret clearance, and be qualified to upgrade the clearance to TOP SECRET, immediately upon award. Offerors possessing the capability to perform the requested work are invited to submit a summary of their capabilities and descriptive literature addressing the above technical areas. The statement of capability should include relevant background and experience, with contract numbers, names and phone numbers of contracting office POC, and names and phone numbers of technical office POC for each contract. Responses to this announcement should be unclassified. Any company proprietary information shall be separately marked. Offerors are advised that the Government intends to use a non-Government person to provide technical reviews of statements of capability submitted in response to this synopsis. Responses shall be single spaced; single sided and shall be submitted in five copies. There are no page limits to responses. Drawings, diagrams, or figures may be provided as an attachment to the response to clarify stated capabilities.</p>
<p>The PWS details the 412 EWG required support, therefore, the Government is requesting that interested concerns furnish the following information: (1) Company name, address, point of contact, telephone number and e-mail address. (2) Type of business, i.e., small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned, HubZone, serviced-disabled veteran-owned small business, large business, etc. under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541330 which contains a size standard of $25,000,000.00.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) seeks to identify, and obtain information from responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the potable water distribution, service water distribution, and wastewater collection systems at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ.  Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  

In conjunction with the conveyance of the systems, the Contractor will be required to provide utility services, including improvements, upgrades, repairs, expansions, investments, and plant replacement, as well as continued operation and maintenance of the utility distribution systems.  Additionally, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental services for the conveyed systems.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688  Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter Notice) is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.  Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 3:00 pm EST on Thursday, March 19, 2009.  Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:  (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (small, or any sub-category of small business, or other than small).  The potential for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Governments use as a market research tool.  As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the June-July 2009 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.  Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.  

This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.

If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DESC Contracting Office.

Installation Description
Situated on a 6,500-acre military installation located in the northwest corner of New Jersey, Picatinny plays a unique role in the United States' ability to wage war. There is no other comprehensive armaments facility like it in the country; it is a one-of-a-kind facility that provides virtually all of the lethal mechanisms used in Army weapon systems and those of the other military services. Picatinny indeed is a joint service armament research and development center. 

Through the years, Picatinny's major developments in manufacturing and technology have reduced dependence on foreign sources and provided our service members with a range of weapons. During World War II, it was the only facility in the United States producing ammunition larger than 50 caliber. While some applied research in explosives, propellants, and pyrotechnics was conducted, funding for overall research and development was almost nonexistent during the first half of the century. 

This all changed in the years following World War II when Picatinny was given a leadership role in the research, development, engineering, and production support for advanced weapon systems. From fuzes, propellants, fire control systems, and energetics to the lethal power of mortars, tanks, and artillery, Picatinny manages the process from birth to battlefield.
Picatinny's mission is to support Army transformation goals. In an effort to streamline the acquisition process and deliver the armaments soldiers need exactly when they need them-and at an affordable price- Picatinny has established increasingly close partnerships with universities and industry partners, involving them in collaborative efforts early in the research and development process. 

Picatinny uses unique laboratories and special facilities to evaluate prototype designs, thus reducing development cycle time. These facilities are also available to Picatinny's contractors and other government agencies that are part of the national energetic consortium established by Picatinny and the Army Research Laboratory.

<DESC>THIS IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY, NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE OR SOLICITATION. The Food and Drug Administration, Jefferson Laboratories, in Jefferson, Arkansas, is seeking business sources, including service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and 8(a) certified companies. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort:

The government is looking for sources to provide transgenic mice (both Male and Female) genetically engineered to over express two separate genes associated with Alzheimers disease.  The mice should over express the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the gamma secreatase enzyme which cleaves the APP to its toxic AB fragment. By expressing these double mutations, the animal closely mimics the human condition of the disease.  

The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is-541711- Research and Development in Biotechnology; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.

Potential contractors must indicate business size and proof of any set-aside certification and provide a contact name, the mailing address, phone number and email address of point of contact. Capability statements must provide enough information to determine if the company can meet the requirement. 

Interested Contractors must respond with capability statements which are due in person, by postal mail, fax or email to the point of contact listed below on or before Thursday February 19, 2009 by 13:00 hours (Central Time in Jefferson, Arkansas) at the Food and Drug Administration, OC/OSS/OFFAS, Attn: Nick Sartain, 3900 NCTR Road, HFT-320, Jefferson, AR 72079-9502.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking potential small business concerns that may be capable of providing for the delivery of training related to conducting disability hearings.  SSA has developed and implemented a process whereby disability beneficiaries who have been notified that their disability has ceased, did not exist, or is no longer disabling are provided a face-to-face due process evidentiary hearing at the reconsideration level of SSAs appeals process. This due process hearing, commonly referred to as a disability hearing, is generally the responsibility of the state agencies known as Disability Determination Services (DDS); A Federal process has been established for States that have declined the process and for cases in which the initial determination was made by an SSA employee.  The decision maker at this face-to-face hearing is referred to as the Disability Hearing Officer (DHO).  

The training will prepare the Hearing Officers with conducting face-to-face hearings for individuals whose disability benefits are going to be ceased.  These hearings are conducted under the guidance of the Goldberg vs. Kelly, U.S. Supreme Court decision that mandates how and in what manner such a hearing is to be conducted to ensure the claimant receives due process. 

The responsibilities of the SSA DHO training contractor would be: 

1) Provide a minimum of two and a maximum of 4 eight day training classes per year for a maximum of 25 trainees (the number of training classes per year is SSAs option); 

2) Provide a 3-day overview class for SSA administrators once a year; 

3) Conduct training classes in a suitable facility conducive to classroom instruction with facilities for conducting mock hearings; 

4) The training facility should be connected with a law school accredited by the American Bar Association; 

5) Provide a suitably qualified and trained faculty to provide the training; 

6) The training facility will be in close proximity to establishments providing food and lodging for the trainees; 

7) The contractor will be flexible in accommodating additional training needs that may arise; 

8) The contractor will present a plan for training Disability Hearing Officers, demonstrating knowledge of the SSA Continuing Disability Review (CDR) process and the Goldberg vs. Kelly requirements for due process; 

9) Provide for the use of up to 25 laptop computers for the use of trainees during the class; 

10) Maintain an electronic case bank for instruction of the trainees; 

11) Provide additional training as the need arises (such as the production of DVD training or IVT broadcast at SSA headquarters); 

12) Document all training to ensure accurate SSA performance audits; 

13) Provide a means of surveying student satisfaction with the training; and 

14) Ensure the security of all information in accordance with SSA-established requirements.

SSA will provide electronic case files for training purposes.  These case files will be purged of all personally identifiable information (PII).  The contractor must also be available to meet with SSA staff in Baltimore, Maryland for a 1-day meeting, to be briefed on the duties of the DHOs/DEs and to obtain information concerning the precise goals, concepts and plans developed for the DHO course. The contractor must be able to provide all personnel, materials, supplies, and services required to support the training.

As stated above, this is a Sources Sought Notice seeking information from Small Business Concerns, which may be capable of providing these services.  Information received from other than Small Business sources will not be considered.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 611310.  The size standard for this NAICS code is $7 million.  Interested small business concerns should send capability statements to Kevin.Muniz@SSA.gov in the Office of Acquisition and Grants (OAG).  The capability statement should include Central Contractor Registration (CCR) information (website: http://www.ccr.gov).  The size limitation for e-mail attachments is 5 megabytes. MS Word 2002 is the standard word processing software.  Submit responses on or before 4:30 P.M. EST on 02/16/2009.  No other responses will be accepted after this date and time.  

The Government does not intend to reimburse for any information or materials submitted in response to this sources sought notice.  This is not a request for quotes or proposals.  No formal solicitation document exists at this time.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review.  No contract award will be made on the basis of the responses received.

<DESC>Description: U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development & Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA, is seeking information from industry to determine potential sources of ballistic fragmentation and blunt trauma protective knee and elbow pads that can be integrated with current battle uniforms such as (but not limited to) the Army Combat Uniform (ACU) and Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform (MCCUU).  Pads shall be worn over said uniforms and not interfere with the form or function of the garments.  Joint protection systems must articulate and not impede the range of motion of the user. Retention must be securely maintained throughout use without causing discomfort to the user and while still allowing for quick donning and doffing. If there are no solutions that offer ballistic protection, those that offer significant low-speed impact protection will be investigated.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS, there is no Solicitation document available at this time.  Responses to this Request for Information (RFI) may be directed to Nick Tsantinis at nick.tsantinis@us.army.mil.

This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements", Application for Brand Name Subscription<br />United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires Tony Parachute Suits. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Tony Suits, manufacturer of the parachute suits. Interested parties may e-mail alyson.gowin@macdill.af.mil not later than Tuesday, February 17, 2009; 8:00 a.m. EST.<br />Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:<br />22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)
<p>The USSOCOM Para-Commandos currently have Tony Suits parachute suits to perform jumps in. The purpose of this purchase order is to replace some of the existing suits with new ones as well as purchase additional suits for the new tandem team. In order for the team to convey a uniform appearance during demonstrations as well as during tandem parachuting missions, it is essential to match the new suits exactly to the existing Tony suits. Mixing suits doesn't portray the team in accordance with the Commander's intent of the team to perform across the continental United States as ambassadors of the command. Totally replacing all current jumpsuits with a different manufacturer's model would cost the Government an additional $7,500, an approximate increase in cost of 113% and it would be detrimental to the command to use any other brand name at this point.</p>

<DESC><p>This is not a solicitation, but a Notice of Contract Action. The AFDW/A7KM, Ft. Detrick MD, intends to award a sole-source Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract to the JEOL USA for JEOL Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Model JSM-6610LV. Description:(a) The SEM shall be capable of achieving a resolution of at least 3.0 nm at high accelerating voltage in the Secondary Electron Image (SEI) mode and 4.0 nm by Backscatter Electron Image (BEI) in the differentially pumped mode. In the high vacuum mode it should be possible to attain a resolution of 15 nm at 1 kV, 8 nm at 3 kV, and 3.5 at 25 kV at the analytical working distance. Low kV imaging is the only way to see surface topology and textures. Higher kV imaging means the electron beam goes further into the sample and those emitted secondaries are from those deeper areas. (b) The SEM must have a hinged door to allow direct placement of our samples under the final lens. This removes the possibility of damaging the final lens causing extensive repair when the drawer pull out stage type is used. The stage must be fully movable after sample placement, before the door is closed to allow direct observation of exact positioning under the final lens. Must allow operator to adjust/secure uniquely shaped samples as needed before closing the chamber door. (c) Accommodation of samples 12 inches in diameter by 3 inches high and weighing up to 3 kg. A 15 lb sample weight must be achievable under limited conditions. It should be possible to tilt an 8 inch sample up to 35 degrees at a working distance as short as 10 mm and up to 50 degrees at 20 mm. (d) Stage navigation system using camera at atmosphere or vacuum to take top down color image of sample which allows point and click navigation during SEM use shall be standard. (e) SEM up-time shall be guaranteed at least 90% averaged of a twelve month period. (f) SEM must have an in-line Probe Current Detector (PCD). For quantitative analysis, a PCD must be used to guarantee probe current.(g) Must have has a zoom condenser (two-stage) to eliminate shifting of the focus stigmation when adjusting probe current between imaging and analysis conditions. (h) Must have top down Charged Coupled Device (CCD) to take color images to be used for navigation of the sample. (i) Must have dedicated rotary pump for the chamber to allow low vacuum operat ion. This dedicated pump only pumps the specimen chamber to allow cleaner operation with more efficient sample throughput. (j) The SEM must be compatible with Department of Energy (DOE) systems in order to allow direct validation of results. This requires that data files be consistent between the two systems. Under the authority of USC 2304(c)(1) pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(2)(i), supplies or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. A determination not to compete this requirement is based on market research and is solely within the discretion of the Government. This announcement is not a request for competitive quotations. Inquiries should be directed no later than 12:00 p.m., 19 January 2009, via email, referencing FA7014-09-R-0015, to Mr. Keith Hunter, Contract Specialist, keith.hunter.ctr@detrick.af.mil. The Government will review all responses, without prejudice, whether or not the Government initially determines that another firm is fully qualified to fulfill the U.S. Air Force requirement. Note: If documents are sent via email, the contractor will be responsible for validating Government receipt by call the Contract Specialist at (301) 619-8924. No solicitation is available and telephone requests for information will not be honored.</p>

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

The Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS-S&T), Explosives Division, has been tasked to conduct operational field demonstrations of remotely operated and standoff explosives countermeasure technologies to address the threat from suicide bomber, leave-behind, and vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices.  DHS-S&Ts Standoff Technology Integration and Demonstration Program (STIDP) is designed to accelerate the development of standoff explosives detection technologies, related technologies, concept of operations, and training. The ultimate goal of the program is to prevent explosives attacks at large public events via a spiral development approach to technology and systems development. 

The STIDP is planning to conduct multiple field tests, with the earliest possible time being summer/fall, 2009.  The intent of the field test is to evaluate an integrated people-tracking system/concealed object detection system as part of an overall countermeasure architecture to determine system and individual sensor technical performance, integration approaches, and concept of operations effectiveness in a live, operational environment. 


PROBLEM STATEMENT 

The program requires that sensor and surveillance camera video be generated, displayed, recorded, archived, and mined over a network for key test parameters.  During live operations, video data generated will be displayed and recorded over a network in real time.  Archiving and mining of the data will take place after live operations have been terminated and may be performed from multiple workstations. 

The program is interested in using a system for the flexible and cost-effective management, editing, and analysis of the video data. Management of the video data will include the automatic recording and storage of the video as well as providing the ability to view playbacks of the video data on networked workstations based upon user-defined date and time criteria. The video storage portion of the system will be required to automatically manage video datasets based upon date and time criteria as well as the source of the recordings. Sources supplying video feeds to the system will include various camera types (e.g. surveillance and infrared) as well as other sources such as software interface image captures, and sensors. The storage of data must be non-proprietary in format, allowing the data to be accessed and viewed by third-party software applications. The storage of data also needs to be machine-independent. Data archives managed by the system should allow for the movement of the datasets to various machines or networks without the need to create exported subsets of the data. Desired editing functionality includes the ability to create high-quality, high-resolution video clips from the video dataset based upon user-defined data and time criteria. The system should allow for the exportation of video clips in various formats such as .avi and .mpg files and enable an analyst to add notations or markings to the video image. The system should allow for clipping of a section from a single video frame.

Desired analysis capabilities include the ability to search for and play back video from one or more video sources during an active recording session as well as providing an automated manner in which to create statistics from the recorded video. These statistics may include time periods in which there is no movement present in the video as well as time periods of heavy movement. The desired analysis tools would also provide a means to perform pattern matching which would allow for the flagging of time periods in which large groupings of people are present in the field of view as well as periods in which pedestrians or objects are moving counter to the traffic flow. The tools should also provide a means to tie textual information to the individual video datasets. This textual information may include notations from analysts as well as alert descriptions and definitions generated by third-party sensors or software.

Some of the key challenges for video data management include: 
1)	Processing, storage, and transferring large video datasets
2)	Accepting input from a dynamic number of sources as well as source types (cameras, s-video)
3)	Providing the ability to play back video during the testing process while continuing to record and process incoming datasets
Ultimately, implementation of a video management, editing, and analysis system (which may include more than one technology) should address these features: 
1)	Easily scalable to any number of input sources
2)	Provides high-resolution, high-quality video exports in multiple formats (e.g. .avi, .mpeg, .mov) Provides portable datasets that can be viewed on multiple computers simultaneously
3)	Provides non-proprietary datasets that can be accessed or viewed by third-party software applications
4)	Integrates non-video meta-data with video data through the use of date and time stamps
5)	Provides editing  and analysis functionality of video datasets
6)	Provides the ability to generate statistics based upon patterns found in the video data.
REQUIREMENTS
Operating Environment
o	Provide simultaneous access to multiple computers on a network without significantly degrading other network traffic
o	Allow viewing of recorded data while real-time video is being recorded
o	Allow random-access searching and viewing based upon date and time criteria
o	Provide documented, easy-to-learn-and-use graphical user interface
o	Operate in a Windows-based operating system

Tracking Requirements
o	Provide the ability to easily and dynamically add and remove video sources with minimal changes to the systems configuration 
o	Provide a means to archive or back up the video data over a network
o	Provide the ability to set custom archiving and processing schedules
o	Allow the movement of archived data from one location to another without losing the ability to access and process the data
o	Provide the means to search the data sets based upon time or alert indices
o	Provide the ability to easily create high-quality exports of video segments in multiple video file formats
o	Provide the means to analyze and mine video data
o	Provide the means to perform self diagnostics
o	Allow for real-time playback
o	Provide the ability to create custom views of the data
o	Provide multi-sensor and camera views during real-time events and post events

First-Line Screening Sensors for Detection of Concealed Objects

DESCRIPTION

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS-S&T), Explosives Division, has been tasked to conduct operational field demonstrations of remotely operated and standoff explosive countermeasure technologies to address the threat from suicide bomber, leave-behind, and vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices.DHS-S&Ts Standoff Technology Integration Demonstration Program (STIDP) is designed to accelerate the development of standoff explosives detection technologies, concept of operations, and training. The ultimate goal of the program is to prevent explosive attacks at large public events via a spiral development approach. 

STIDP seeks to obtain information on sensors or detectors that can be used to conduct non-contact screening of patrons at large public events in large, free-flowing crowds.  One example is to use a network of perimeter-deployed metal detectors that could detect the presence of metallic fragmentation materials in an improvised explosive device (IED).  In addition to electromagnetic approaches, other possible technologies include (but are not limited to) acoustic/ultrasonic and radar.  These first line sensors would serve as a first layer of screening that could provide a means of identifying persons of interest for subsequent screening by more advanced standoff detection systems (e.g., infrared thermal imaging, millimeter wave, terahertz, etc.).  Individual sensors and networked sensors are both of interest.

The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to identify interested parties or teams that have existing or prototype sensors that can detect concealed objects (IEDs) on moving individuals and who wish to participate in a field test to evaluate the integration of first-line sensors with an overall concealed object detection architecture or system of systems.  Companies with viable technologies may receive funding for product maturation and/or system integration and for field test support.

FIRST-LINE SENSOR PROBLEM STATEMENT

Technology-based threat assessments often treat all entities in the population to be screened as equal probability threats.  Screening 100% of incoming patrons with the most effective detection technologies is presently expensive and man-power intensive. One alternative is to make an initial assessment that identifies an anomalous characteristic for some individuals in the population that triggers additional screening, with the goal of making a determination of threat or no threat, or that can eliminate portions of the crowd from the need for additional screening.  For such a first-line system to be useful, the false negative probability for the target threats must be minimized, often at the expense of higher rates of false alarms.  An effective first-line system that is highly sensitive to target threats will identify a sub-population for screening that is much smaller than the whole population, despite the high false alarm rate, because the prevalence of threats is extremely rare.
Some of the key challenges at large public events include: 
1)	There are multiple entry routes to the venue.
2)	There are porous boundaries entering the venues outer fringes.
3)	Pedestrian traffic can range from single patrons to large families or common affiliates.
4)	Patrons will mix in and out, depending on crowd flow and layout of the venues paths of ingress/egress
5)	Paths of ingress/egress range from narrow, occluded walkways to wide open grassy parks and parking lots.
6)	Pedestrian traffic does not simultaneously flow in one direction.
7)	The time-based crowd flow, in terms of numbers of people, typically has a steep ramp-up just before the event begins.
8)	During periods of heaviest crowd flow, there is significant blocking of a large portion of the crowd by people in front of them, limiting line-of-sight screening options.

REQUIREMENTS
Operating Environment
The technology or system must meet the following operating requirements: 
	Operate outdoors, with minimal impact from weather (heat, cold, rain, snow, wind)
	Operate in high and low light and in the presence of shadows
	Ideally be operable at night without artificial lighting
	Have minimal interference from other moving objects in the scene (e.g., vehicles, wind-blown trees, shrubs, and flags).

First-Line Sensor Features

The following represent the minimum technology requirements for first-line sensor technologies to be considered as a candidate technology for the STIDP:

	The first-line system must detect evidence of threats while considering potential issues of personal privacy.

	The evidence that is used by the first-line sensor or system must be a characteristic of the threat and not population profiling.

	The first-line system must be tunable for sensitivity to the threat objects, allowing for the control of the probability of detection and false alarm rate.

	The first-line system should operate without constant operator engagement.  The system should provide an alert and sufficient information (e.g., a signal output or trigger) to permit hand-off of the potential threat to other technologies or interdiction.  This must occur in real time.

	It is very likely that the first-line system will require multiple sensors to monitor the first-line boundary.   These sensors need to communicate to a console that can be managed by a limited number of personnel.  As an example, if 50 sensors are needed to monitor the first-line boundary, it is not feasible to engage 50 operators to watch the sensors.

	The first-line system must have a calibration process and a check source that can be used to assess the state of health for the technology.  A network of sensors must have a self-assessment capability and dynamic reporting of sensor failure.  Sensor failures may consist of a catastrophic loss of a sensor or sensor response drift outside of control limits.

	Networked sensor systems must be designed to minimize communication latencies and to prevent system paralysis when multiple sensors report detection events.

	Sensors must not require that a person walk through a portal or be required to stop.

Desirable Technology Capabilities

The following list represents technology capabilities that are desirable to DHS S&T, but not actual requirements at this time:

-	Battery operation (which could preclude the necessity to install power infrastructure)
-	Wireless communication (which could preclude the necessity to install communications infrastructure)
-	Low cost
-	Minimal manpower requirements (less is better)
-	Easily configured for change in location, orientation, and venue
-	Technologies with open interfaces or that are easily integrated into other 3rd-party architectures (preferably open architectures).

Key Words:  sensor, sensor network, node, detector, concealed object detection, concealed weapon detection, metal detection, improvised explosive device, suicide bomber, crowds, IED signatures, standoff, large public events

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. The Government will utilize the information provided only to develop the acquisition strategy for future requirements. All information submitted will be held in a confidential status.<BR><BR>Shaped Demolition Charge primary use is for boring holes in earth, metal, masonry, concrete, and paved and unpaved roads.  When the charge is detonated, the explosive is converted to a compressed gas.  The gas exerts pressure in the form of a shockwave.  The main charge converts the shaped liner into a high speed jet charge, which penetrates the target. The manufacture of shaped charge requires special skills and facilities. Melt pour loading of high explosives is a critical technology. Critical skills include laboratory personnel, explosive operators, quality assurance, environmental, and research and development. Critical facilities include temperature controlled cooling bays, melt pour systems, real time x-rays/x-ray technicians. X-rays are important to determine whether the melt-pour casting is free of cracks, voids, porosity, or separation.  Defects can cause malfunctioning of the charge. <BR><BR>M3A1 40 lb Shaped Demolition Charges (NSN: 1375-00-088-6691) penetrate reinforced concrete to a depth of about 5 feet, with the diameter of the hole tapering from 3.5 inches at the mouth.

It also contains a 0.11 pounds Composition A-3 booster charge. Both the Comp B (or Insensitive Comp B equivalent) and Comp A-3 will be provided as Government Furnished Material. The explosive charge is enclosed in a sheet steel container with a steel cavity liner and a tin plated steel closing cap. The shaped charge assembly also has a carrying strap made of cotton webbing and a detachable three-legged steel pedestal. The charges are covered in a barrier material and packed in wooden boxes. <BR><BR>M2A4 15 Lb Shaped Demolition Charges (NSN: 1375-01-023-7994) penetrate reinforced concrete to a depth of about 2.5 feet, with the diameter of the hole tapering from 2.75 inches at the mouth. This charge consists of approximately 11.5 pounds of Composition B (or Insensitive Comp B Equivalent), which is loaded using a melt-pour process. It also contains a 0.11 pounds of Composition A-3 booster charge. Both the Comp B (or Insensitive Comp B equivalent) and Comp A-3 explosive will be provided as Government Furnished Material. The explosive charge is enclosed in a molded fiberglass container with a glass cone liner and a tin plated steel closing cap. The shaped charge assembly also has a carrying strap made of cotton webbing and a detachable molded fiberglass standoff. Each charge with the standoff is packed in a fiberboard box with foam cushions. Then the fiberboard box is put in a barrier bag.  4 charges are packed in a wooden box.<BR><BR>Interested companies should respond by providing the government the following information: a brief summary of the company's capabilities (a description of facilities, personnel, and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above criteria) and availability.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<BR>The specific criteria against which the competing proposals were evaluated consisted of the following Factors (in descending order of importance) <BR>     Factor 1 - Technical Capability<BR>     Factor 2 - Past Performance <BR>     Factor 3 - Price<BR>C.  EVALUATION APPROACH<BR>All proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel.<BR>1.  FACTOR 1:  TECHNICAL CAPABIILTY APPROACH <BR>          Sub-factor A.  Corporate Experience and Capability - The Government will assess the offerors experience with work of similar nature, scope, complexity, Past Performance and difficulty to that which will be performed under the prospective contract contemplated by this solicitation.  Also describe secured and non-secured facilities (conference room, VTC, etc) that are available for use in the performance of the PWS. The Government will evaluate the offerors on-going and prior experience within the last three years on projects similar in size, scope, cost, and complexity to that described in the PWS.  The objective of the evaluation is to:<BR>(1) Determine the degree to which the offeror has previously encountered and successfully satisfied requirements of like breadth, detail, and challenges that it may encounter under the prospective contract; and<BR>(2) Develop insight into the offerors demonstrated capabilities and its ability to meet the Governments stated requirement.<BR>(3) Assess the offerors understanding of the requirement for the support described in the PWS. <BR>          Sub-factor B.  Quality Control - The government will assess the offerors ability to develop and maintain an effective quality control program to ensure performance of services in accordance with this PWS.  The offeror must show how it will develop and implement procedures to identify, prevent, and ensure non-recurrence of defective services.  A thorough understanding that the offerors quality control program is the means by which the Offeror assures that the work complies with the requirement of the contract. <BR>     2.  FACTOR 2:  PAST PERFORMANCE APPROACH: <BR>The Past Performance Team evaluates past performance by assessing the Offerors recent performance on projects similar in scope to the PWS of the solicitation.  When assessing performance risk, the Government will focus its inquiry on the Offerors past performance under existing and prior contracts over the past five (5) years as it relates to all solicitation requirements.  Relevancy is defined as the scope, magnitude, complexity, and similarity of Offerors past performance as it relates to this acquisition.  <BR>When an Offeror lacks institutional experience necessary to provide this information, the Offeror can use past performance of personnel proposed to perform this requirement. Offerors who have no history of past performance, or even whom past performance information is unavailable shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, the neutral rating will be used.  When unfavorable relevant past performance information is received for any Offeror, the Government may disregard or discount that information if convincing evidence demonstrates that the performance problems identified were outside the control of the Offeror or due to excusable delays.  The Government may use personal knowledge or information from other sources in its evaluation of an Offerors past performance, provided information is consistent with the established evaluation criteria of the RFP.<BR>The Past Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an Offerors likelihood of success in performing the solicitations requirements as indicated by that Offerors record of past performance.  Performance Risk Factor Rating of Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk or Unknown Risk will be assigned to the Past Performance Factor.  Offerors that would be eliminated from the competitive range solely based on negative findings in past performance shall be given an opportunity to address such findings.<BR>Adverse Past Performance may result in an overall high-risk rating. Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will be evaluated on past performance information regarding predecessor companies and key personnel who have experience relevant to the instant acquisition.  In this case, an unknown risk factor will be given. <BR>The evaluation process will consider the following:<BR>     (1)  Quality of Product or Service <BR>     (2)  Timeliness of Performance<BR>     (3)  Business Relations<BR>     (4)  Management of Key Personnel<BR>     (5)  Compliance with Environmental, Safety, Health and Security Requirements<BR>It is incumbent upon the offerors to explain the relevance of data provided in the proposal.  Offerors are responsible for completeness and accuracy of performance information obtained from other sources.<BR>    3.  FACTOR 3  PRICE:<BR>The Offeror will be evaluated based on completeness, reasonableness and balance.  The determination that the total price is reasonable will be based on information submitted with the offerors proposal (See Instruction to Offerors), the comparison of other competitive offers, and the Independent Government Estimate (IGCE).<BR>            a. Reasonableness.   An assessment of the Offerors estimating methodology <BR>to determine whether the proposed s are reasonable based upon a comparison with the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) and s proposed by other Offerors and realistic based upon the requirements.  <BR>            b. Completeness.  This includes responsiveness in addressing all RFP<BR>requirements.  The proposal will be reviewed to ensure data provided is sufficient <BR>to allow a complete analysis and evaluation of the items delineated in the CLINs <BR>and includes all information required in Instructions, Conditions and Notices to Offerors.<BR>       c. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the <BR>total for all options to the total for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the options are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <BR> (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<BR>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR>The provision at FAR 52.222-22,  Previous Contracts and Compliance Reports applies to  this acquisition..<BR>(X).

Information pertaining to qualifications of products may be obtained from Navy Clothing and Textile Research, Donna Streets, NAVY Clothing and Textiles Research Facility, Attn: N2, Bldg. 86, Kansas St, Natick MA. 01760.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NICHD2009027 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation /contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-29, Amendment 1.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 492110 with a size standard of 1500 employees.  This is set-aside for Small Businesses.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Fogarty International Center (FIC) has a requirement for a Contractor to provide services to pick up and deliver passport and visa applications and process them through the appropriate embassies or Department of State and various foreign embassies.  It is the intent of the Institute to award a contract for Base Year (12 months) plus Four (4) Option Years.

STATEMENT OF WORK

The John E. Fogarty International Center (FIC) promotes and supports scientific research and training internationally to reduce disparities in global health.  Located in Bethesda, Maryland, it has been the international training and research arm of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for the past 40 years.  As a part of carrying out its mission, FIC also supports the NIH by providing sole responsibility for the processing of official government passports, diplomatic passports, as well as visas obtained through local embassies.  
The Fogarty International Center supports all NIH employees, including the NIH Director, who travel on official business to foreign countries by providing official passports and obtaining visas for foreign country travel.
The contractor shall provide services to pick up and deliver passport and visa applications and process them through the appropriate embassies or Department of State and various foreign embassies. 
An important element in providing this service is obtaining passports and visas on short notice.  It is also important that the FIC staff who manage the visa/passport function be able to reach the contractor by telephone between the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. weekdays to obtain immediate information, advice, and updates on pending applications.
The daily pick up and delivery of passport and visas and/or applications for the morning schedule shall be between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m.  The afternoon schedule shall be between the hours of 3:30 p.m. and 5:00 p.m.  All deliveries to the FIC must be made no later than 5:00 p.m.  
	Daily pick-up and delivery (morning and afternoon) of passport and visa applications from:
John E. Fogarty International CenterNational Institutes of Health31 Center Drive MSC 2220Building 31, Room B2C05Bethesda, MD  20892
	Daily delivery of processed passports and visas to the above address.
At the discretion of the FIC, the on-site daily pick up and delivery may be cancelled if there are no passports or visas available for processing and pickup.  FIC may also determine that on-site service may not be in our best interest depending on the passports or visas needed and may opt to change the on-site service to a secure express delivery service such as Federal Express.  Notification will be provided to the contractor in either of these events.
Task One - Execution of Passports and Visas
During pick up and delivery of passport and visa applications, the contractor shall be responsible to review the documents at the FIC site to ensure accuracy and completeness.  This requires up-to-date knowledge of the Department of State (DOS) requirements and regulations and requirements specific to each foreign country embassy for passports and visas related to official travel.   
Passport applications must be processed through the Special Issuance Agency, Department of State and visa applications must be processed through the appropriate foreign embassy.
FIC will require emergency passport processing which shall include:	-  24-48 hour passport processing and	-  same day processing  and pick up and delivery for either passports or visas.
It will be necessary for the contractor to provide visa applications (obtained from foreign embassies) as required.
It will be required that the contractor provide secure handling of all documents to prevent loss and ensure privacy of information contained in documents.  It will also be required that the contractor provide tracking information of all documents.  
The contractor must be familiar with the location, hours, and requirements of each of the foreign embassies.  In the event of emergency passport and/or visa processing, it is especially helpful that the contractor staff have a good working relationship with embassy contacts.
The contractor must be able to accept credit card or check payment from travelers for additional services, such as emergency processing fees, not covered by the FIC and be able to provide a receipt to the traveler.
It is required that the contractor must provide detailed information of all processing fees as part of the invoicing process.
Provide services to foreign visitors invited by National Institutes of Health for assistance in handling foreign passports and visas.

Task Two  Communicating with FIC and Embassies
It will be essential that the contractor have the ability to readily communicate with FIC and embassies to ensure responsiveness on any changes to pick up and delivery schedules, or any emergencies that may arise.    It will be required that the contractor provide daily reports of pick up for passports and visas which can be done electronically, via hard copy (delivered or faxed), or secure delivery service such as Federal Express.
It will be required that the contractor must be able to provide expert advice to FIC regarding:
Issues pertaining to foreign NIH staff in the United States on various visas who will travel to other locations outside the United States for official NIH business; and
On requirements for obtaining visas for all countries included in travel by any HHS employees.

Task Three  Quality Control and Quality Assurance
It is a requirement that the contractor must provide verification of background investigations with clear results for contractor staff handling passports and visas. The contractor assures that passports with appropriate visas are returned to FIC one week prior to travelers scheduled departure date.  Emergency processing of passports and visas does not apply to this one week timeframe.
It is crucial that the contractor assure that passports with appropriate visas are returned to the FIC prior to travelers scheduled departure date. The contractor will also be responsible to review all visa and passport applications for accuracy and completeness.  And if possible, correct errors, if not, return application expeditiously to the FIC.
It will be the contractors responsibility to provide and continuously update foreign embassy visa requirements (in a printed or electronic format).

TECHNICAL EVALUATION

<DESC>NAICS Code:  334516, this is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) and is designated as full and open competition.

In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and FAR Part 12 Commercial Items, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to purchase a Multibiomarker Detection System for the Office of Research and Development/National Health & Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) in RTP, NC.  
The Multibiomarker Detection System is a detection system that quantifies multiple biological compounds with low background, high sensitivity with rapid throughput.  A.	STATEMENT OF WORK AND MINIMUM GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS:  
Project Description: The National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) is responsible for conducting studies of humans to characterize relationships between exposure to environmental pollutants and possible health effects. NHEERL is one of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's key research organizations that examine the effects of contaminants and environmental stressors on human and ecological health status.
Description of Work: The instrument is to be initially located in the Human Studies Facility (HSF) which is headquartered in Chapel Hill, NC.  The analyses will involve understanding the relationships between air and water pollutants of interest to the Agency and effects primarily in humans. These pollutants include, for example, diesel exhaust, arsenic, ozone, and particles in the ambient air.  The instrument used to examine human and ecological health status will be a multibiomarker (ie., multiple biological analytes) detection system which quantifies multiple biological compounds with low background, high sensitivity, rapid throughput.  
Quality Assurance Requirements: 
Analyses on this instrument will be governed by the EPA quality system, as described in the approved HSD Quality Management Plan.  Analyses will be developed into Recommended Operating Procedures and Standard Operating Procedures, if applicable.   Users will consult with HSD?s Quality Assurance Manager prior to initiating work if needed. Users will successfully complete Quality Assurance training if required.Specific requirements include:
	Maximum data per analyses from a large dynamic range, negating requirements for dilutions that double or triple the number of analyses required for a given sample.
Wide dynamic detection range, ElectroChemiLuminescence has a dynamic range that is at least two-fold over any Absorbance or Fluorescence assay.  Weak signals (ie, low amounts) can be detected due to not being obscured by background.  Strong signals (ie, high amounts) are not off-scale and can be detected.
Simultaneous detection of multiple signaling biomarkers will allow us to test a whole signaling pathway with one tiny sample and more economically than performing multiple but separate analyses. 
Analyses of  Biomarkers with kits not currently carried by a manufacturer can be developed in our lab, and can be combined and printed on multiArray plates in a Quality Controlled acceptable process.
High Sensitivity.  Sensitivity is defined as Signal divided by Background (S/B).  Higher signal derives from the sensitivity of tag detection.  The high capacity carbon electrode is optimized for high binding (Plastic plates cannot bind as much).  Small defined ?spot? concentrates material (Traditional coating of plates requires covering the entire bottom and the sides).  Emission is in the red region of visible light (Reduces color quenching). Lower background derives from minimizing background coming from the orthogonal energy source, such as with s fluorescence assays, when only tag label is near the electrode is detected (There is an equilibrium between on and off for all antibodies when antibodies are ?off? and outside the electric field, they do not emit light. (This is very unique.) No auto-electrochemiluminescence or interferences.
Simultaneously detection of biomarkers. multiarray platform to allow simultaneous screening for activity, function, specificity during the development stage 
Fast detection by the  instrumentation.  Fast read times and fast and easy to use software will not create a bottleneck for multiple investigators needing to use the detection system on the same day (flow based techniques take an hour to process a single 96well plate).  Control software is point and click.  New users will require minimal amount of time to be trained.
No washing  of assay plates which allow for better detection with low affinity antibodies (excessive washes often wash away the analyte).  B.  ADDITIONAL SPECIFICATIONS:  The Detection System shall be comprised of instruments that:Handle and analyze samples on matrices (i.e, plates) purchased from the manufacturer;Input, store, manipulate, and analyze data on a Microsoft operating system on a PC. Software is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant. Software will allow real-time display of data as it is being generated. Data can be processed and exported to external databases for use with other software including Microsoft Excel.    Warranty period: Instrument shall be free of defects in workmanship and materials for a period of one year after customer accepts the instrument.  
C.  FIELD INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS AND APPROVAL BY THE NORTH CAROLLINA BUILDING CODE COUNCIL:  	
Equipment shall be listed and labeled by a third-party listing agency approved by the North Carolina Building Code Council.  Go to http://www.ncdoi.com/OSFM/Engineering/engineering_home.asp  Click on Search button at top of page, type in ?third party agencies accredited?.   Prior to shipping unlisted equipment to EPA, a field inspection shall be performed by an approved agency in that listing.  The filed inspection shall be performed at the manufacturer?s place of business and shall be included in the vendor?s quotation.  If the equipment fails the field inspection, the vendor shall make necessary changes to meet the listing agency?s approval.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>

<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>(a) To the extent that this contract provides for furnishing supplies or performing services outside the United States and its outlying areas, this clause applies in lieu of any Federal, State, and local taxes clause of the contract.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>"Contract date," means the date set for bid opening or, if this is a negotiated contract or a modification, the effective date of this contract or modification.</p>
<p>Country concerned means any country, other than the United States and its outlying areas, in which expenditures under this contract are made.</p>

<p>"After-relieved tax," means any amount of tax or duty, other than an excepted tax, that would otherwise have been payable on the transactions or property covered by this contract, but which the Contractor is not required to pay or bear, or for which the Contractor obtains a refund, as the result of legislative, judicial, or administrative action taking effect after the contract date.</p>

<p>(d) The contract price shall be increased by the amount of any after-imposed tax or of any tax or duty specifically excluded from the contract price by a provision of this contract that the Contractor is required to pay or bear, including any interest or penalty, if the Contractor states in writing that the contract price does not include any contingency for such tax and if liability for such tax, interest, or penalty was not incurred through the Contractor's fault, negligence, or failure to follow instructions of the Contracting Officer or to comply with the provisions of paragraph (i) below.</p>
<p>(e) The contract price shall be decreased by the amount of any after-relieved tax, including any interest or penalty. The Government of the United States shall be entitled to interest received by the Contractor incident to a refund of taxes to the extent that such interest was earned after the Contractor was paid by the Government of the United States for such taxes. The Government of the United States shall be entitled to repayment of any penalty refunded to the Contractor to the extent that the penalty was paid by the Government.</p>
<p>(f) The contract price shall be decreased by the amount of any tax or duty, other than an excepted tax, that was included in the contract and that the Contractor is required to pay or bear, or does not obtain a refund of, through the Contractor's fault, negligence, or failure to follow instructions of the Contracting Officer or to comply with the provisions of paragraph (i) below.</p>

<p>(i) The Contractor shall take all reasonable action to obtain exemption from or refund of any taxes or duties, including interest or penalty, from which the United States Government, the Contractor, any subcontractor, or the transactions or property covered by this contract are exempt under the laws of the country concerned or its political subdivisions or which the governments of the United States and of the country concerned have agreed shall not be applicable to expenditures in such country by or on behalf of the United States.</p>

<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.232-33 PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER-CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003)</p>
<p>(a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.</p>
<p>(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--</p>
<p>(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or</p>
<p>(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).</p>
<p>(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.</p>
<p>(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.</p>
<p>(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--</p>
<p>(i) Making a correct payment;</p>
<p>(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and</p>
<p>(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.</p>
<p>(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--</p>
<p>(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or</p>
<p>(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.</p>
<p>(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.</p>
<p>(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>
<p>(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.</p>
<p>(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.</p>

<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g) <br />(1) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

Ombudsman Program
The Coast Guard Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests is a program intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns informally within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum. It is designed to resolve contractor protests in a faster, less expensive manner than could be accomplished at an external forum. Concerns of interested parties can be resolved through independent, government binding adjudication taking place outside the procuring activity's chain of command.

Filing Agency Protests
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Ombudsman Program
The Coast Guard Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests is a program intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns informally within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum. It is designed to resolve contractor protests in a faster, less expensive manner than could be accomplished at an external forum. Concerns of interested parties can be resolved through independent, government binding adjudication taking place outside the procuring activity's chain of command.

In addition, the Government has determined that it may award a contract to as many as three (3) contractors as a result of this procurement.
The reason for these changes stems from the potential for additional work scope that may result from future passage of Congressional legislation associated with national economic stimulus actions.

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 0pt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Department of Homeland Security Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Individual Assistance Division (IA) mission is to ensure that individuals and families that have been impacted by disasters and major catastrophic events have access to the full range of FEMA programs in the most expeditious and cost effective manner available. FEMA's goal is to provide the highest level of quality in these services as possible to such individuals. In order to accomplish this goal, FEMA has a requirement for contractors to provide comprehensive emergency management, project management and program management services as well as construction, architectural, and engineering capabilities to support the IA mission in four areas:&nbsp; (a) Housing Support&nbsp; (b) Construction Services, (c) Mass Care, and (d) Planning, Staffing and Logistics Services. Contractor support must be available for multiple disaster missions of any size, anywhere within their awarded regional sector to provide disaster relief services to individuals within the United States and its territories.&nbsp; While these contracts are generally intended to support response to an initial recovery from high impact larger Presidentially-declared Major Disaster related missions, the contracts do not preclude FEMA from contracting with others, such as local or small businesses when market research or available information indicates that such entities have the capacity and capability to meet FEMA's requirement(s). FEMA's Acquisition strategy is to divide the U.S. and it's territories into four regional Sectors as follows:&nbsp; Alpha Sector (FEMA Regions 8, 9 and 10); Bravo Sector (FEMA Regions 1, 2 and 5); Charlie Sector (FEMA Regions 6 and 7); and Delta Sector (FEMA Regions 3 and 4).&nbsp;&nbsp; The solicitation will therefore allow for four (4) separate (single) IDIQ hybrid cost reimbursement, fixed priced, and time and materials contracts to be awarded; and each successful offeror will be assigned responsibility for one of the sectors indicated above. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Each contract shall be a five (5) multiple-year contract (one base plus four one-year each options.)</span></strong> After the award of the four (4) IDIQ contracts to separate contractors for a determined sector, no further competition for subsequent task orders will take place, unless the Government determines that an awardee cannot perform the services and terminates the contract; the impact of a single disaster/catastrophic event is or becomes so overwhelming that it exceeds the ability, capacity, or capability of a sector awardee in a manner that the sector awardee cannot perform the services in the time and at the quality level and quantity required by the Government: in such a case, the Government reserves the right to compete the task order among the other three (3) awardees to meet the shortfall(s), or conduct an other than full and open competition to award a contract for services in that sector, to one of the other three (3) vendors, in a case where a sector awardee's contract has been terminated. The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 561210 Facilities Support Services. The small business size standard is $32.5 million.&nbsp;&nbsp; This requirement will be competed using FAR Part 15 procedures. The Request for proposal is anticipated to be released on February 19, 2009.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any question regarding this pre-solicitation must be in writing and will be answered during the release of the RFP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Questions/Answers: contractors shall submit all questions regarding this requirement by email to Zahra Hashmi, the Contract Specialist at <a href="mailto:zahr.hashmi@dhs.gov">zahra.hashmi@dhs.gov</a>, and copy <a href="mailto:charles.clemons@dhs.gov">charles.clemons@dhs.gov</a>.</span></p>

<DESC>Forest Service A-E IDIQ  Synopsis Number AE-R2-0002, Amendment 0002

Synopsis Adjustments, Questions and Answers

The Contracting Officer is issuing amendment two to Synopsis AE-R2-0002.  This amendment is to clarify, add to, or adjust some portions of the synopsis.



1.)  Question:  Per Solicitation Number: AE-R2-0002, I have two questions:

1.	Is this a small business set aside?
2.	Is this a request for proposal?

Answer:  No, as stated in the synopsis (synopsis, not solicitation) this is full and open, not a small business set-aside.  This is not a request for proposal.

2.)  Question:  Under Agency Specific Qualifications are interested firms required to have experience with Mineral Surveys to be considered, as mentioned by example in Criteria #1?  Answer:  Yes, except for Nebraska and Kansas where there are no mineral surveys.
 
Criteria 2(a): Is the interested firm required to have experience with obtaining azimuths by solar observations, worked in mountainous terrain and use of OPUS procedures?   Answer:  Yes, firms are expected to be fully qualified to perform all aspects for land surveying including conventional methods and GPS.
 
Criteria 2(e): Is the interested firm required to have experience working in a timbered environment?  Answer:  Yes, The work requested is in the National Forests where timber is the primary vegetation which affects the work environment.
 
3.)  Question:

After reviewing the subject synopsis we have the following questions/clarifications we would appreciate your feedback on:
 
1.     Please clarify that you are requiring that firms have State Licensed Surveyors in the various States listed by Zone only and that you are not requiring these State Licensed Surveyors to live in and/or have offices in these States as well.  Answer:  In order to perform surveys in the particular zone the firm must have a State Licensed surveyor perform the work. The FS does not require the firm to have an office in the state unless this conflicts with State Board requirements regarding firms practicing within the State. If that is the case then the firm would have to have an office in the State. Firms which are located in or within 100 miles of the perimeter are given more consideration during the evaluation process (see the solicitation)

2.     If a firm decides it wants to be considered for more than one Zone or all Zones.  Answer:  A firm may apply for one or more zones, however licensing requirements must be met and again having an office within 100 miles of the perimeter or in the zone greater consideration is given. 
This would mean that it could be chosen for one or more of the Zones it requested this consideration.  Answer:  Yes that is a possibility if qualified in more than one zone.
It would not be a situation where you would be chosen for all you requested to be considered in or none at all.  Answer:  Firms are evaluated for each zone in which they have applied as well as on the overall. So each zone carries the same weight regardless or not if the firm has applied for all. They are not disqualified for proposing on more than one zone, they must be qualified in each.

3.	Please confirm that the page limit includes resumes and example plats.  Answer:  The 60 double sided page limit includes resumes and example plats.

4.)  Question:
Has the USDA, Forest Service, utilized private surveyor(s) in the past 10 years to accomplish survey needs in the 5 Zones?  Answer:  Yes, except in Nebraska
Were there contract(s) vehicles in place during the last 10 years similar to the subject solicitation? Answer:  Yes  
If so, please quantify by Zone:
1. Number of survey contracts? Answer:  One contract per zone in the past, but could be one contract for multiple zones
2. Dollar value of surveys by year?  Answer:  it varies from year to year, usually greater than $100,000 per year
3. Names of Contractors?  Answer:  Not available at this time.
Will the USDA, Forest Service, issue more than 1 contract per Zone? Answer:  It is possible, but unlikely.
5.)  Question:

The notice says everything should be presented on 8 x 11 sheets.  Does this include the maps of the example projects you are requesting?  Can the maps be full size and folded and inserted in a pouch that is bound in the proposal?  Answer:  Yes, folded is an acceptable format.

We have a teaming agreement with a firm in Colorado that could propose on several zones.  Will the selection team look more favorably on a larger team that could work in several zones or on a small team that could cover on zone very well?  We are trying to determine if it would be in our best interest to team up and propose on a larger area, or stay smaller and propose on just one area.  Answer:  There isnt a preference one way or another regarding team size and number of zones covered.

6.)  Question:  It is clear in the "Agency Specific Qualifications" that the solicitation is asking for a separate narrative on the listed topics as well as map copies.  Should firms also submit a separate narrative and separate resumes for the "Basic Qualifications" items, or is it intended for this information be included within the Standard 330 Form?  Answer:  You need to address Basic Qualifications , this is part of how you will be evaluated; offerors are free to provide as much or as little information  as they deem appropriate within established page limits.  SF 330's are required; we are aware there is some overlap between Basic Qualifications and the SF 330.   Failure to include a response to Basic Qualifications Evaluation Factors will be disqualified.

7.)  Question:  Do all of the zones use the same Cad platform? If so, what platform is used? Answer:  Yes, or they have the ability to read .dwg or .dxf files.  Is there a preferred earthwork and coordinate geometry package? i.e. Geopak, Inroads, or Civil3D. The contractor may use whatever COGO package they prefer.  If we decide to submit a proposal for more than one zone, how will the proposal be scored. Will it be the same score applied to each zone, or will we get a different score that is based on how strong we are in each particular zone?  Answer:  All proposals for each zone are evaluated based on the qualification of the submitting firm. The firm will receive a rating and will be used in all zones for which they applied for.  I didn't see any requirement for disadvantage business enterprise (8a Company) for a certain percentage of the work. Will extra points be awarded for utilizing an 8a company? 

8.)  Question;  In clarifying that 'Firms must be licensed in the State(s) if bidding on more than one sub zones or in all States if Bidding on Zone 5 as a whole.'    When you state 'Firms must be licensed' are you referring to the 'surveyor' being licensed in that zone?  Answer:  A firm which is proposing for a zone, multiple zones or a sub zone as in Zone 5. The Surveyor responsible for the work must be licensed as a Registered Professional Land Surveyor in the State or States in which the zone is located.

9.) Question:  

in your synopsis you make mention of many of the items addressed in the SF330.    Are you listing these items to make certain they are included in our SF330 or do you wish to have a broader view included per item in documentation outside of the SF330?  If so would you like these in an individual narrative format?  Answer:  Firms must complete the SF330 form, and they must answer the Basic Evaluation Criteria, and the Specific Evaluation Criteria, there is a requirement for a narrative under the Specific Criteria. If a firm desires to add more in a narrative that is acceptable.    

(i.e.  resume for surveyor in charge to include. . .    Are you specifying information you wish to be within their SF330 resume or would you like a more detailed and explicit resume sent of the individual?  Answer:  Firms are expected to submit in the SF330 the requested information and if necessary a detailed resume of the State Registered Land Surveyor in responsible charge of the requested work and who will be the signing land surveyor.   

10.)  Question:  Does each firm of the proposed team (prime and sub-contractor) need to provide items 1 and 2 as separate firms under the Agency Specific Qualifications?  Or, as a team (prime with subcontractors), should the proposal have a single item 1 & 2 encompassing both prime & all subcontractors?  Answer:  If a firm is proposing to use a subcontractor as part of their proposal, then the primary firm and the subcontractor must both submit a full package as to their qualifications. The subcontractor must meet all the qualifications as would any of the perspective firms.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of the Department of the Under Secretary of Defense - Quality of Life Office, the Department of Defense (DoD) requires a contractor to provide services in support of the Military and Family Counseling Services/Military Community and Family Policy.  This program develops, administers and monitors the establishment of a non-medical counseling program for military Service members and their families at locations worldwide.  The non-medical counseling support is intended to augment existing military and civilian support services but is not to replace Service funded staff positions.
This effort represents a follow-on requirement to DOI/NBCAQD contract number 1406-04-07-CT-66523.

BACKGROUND
The Global War on Terror has resulted in an unprecedented level of deployments of American military personnel to Iraq, Afghanistan and other international areas of extreme conflict.  These deployments into harm's way, which are viewed nightly on national television, have placed extreme stress on military families.  Stress on marriages is at unprecedented levels and divorce rates, particularly in the Army, are at all time highs.  Military families are struggling to balance complex and competing demands requiring a wide range of problem solving skills:  being a single parent; communications; child care; financial stability; spouse employment; fluctuating family income; frequent relocations; isolation from other extended families, children's education, etc.  The Department of Defense recognizes that families also serve and is committed to supporting military families.  
The Department intends to make short term, situational, problem-solving counseling services available to Service members and families world-wide as needed.  This non-medical counseling is designed to help Service members and their families cope with the normal reactions to the stressful/adverse situations created by deployments.  Situations meeting the diagnostic criteria for the most common mental disorders found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) will be referred to TRICARE or other providers of professional mental health care.  With the exception of mandatory state, federal and military reporting requirements (i.e., domestic violence, child abuse, and duty to warn situations) this problem-solving counseling will be private and confidential to encourage the widest level of participation.  This Military and Family Life Counseling Service fills a widely recognized need for private counseling services.  

OBJECTIVE
The counseling program will consist of an as needed, short-term, situational, problem-solving counseling service for Service members and families that addresses the stressors of the military lifestyle. The counseling service will assist Service members and families in dealing with relationships, crisis intervention, stress management, family issues, parent-child communications, family separations, reunions and reintegration due to deployments.  The counseling service will also assist military members and families volunteering their support for military communities and families (i.e., Family Readiness Group Leaders, Family Support Volunteers).  	There will be four systems of counseling service delivery.  The scope of care for all four systems of delivery will cover only DSM-IV V-Codes.  	1)	Outreach/Rotational: Counseling services may be delivered by counselors enrolled in the contractor's network of providers.  Service delivery will be provided both on and off the military installations within the civilian community, but it will not be provided in military Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF). Counseling services will consist of face-to-face counseling, outreach/awareness services, and educational services provided on a short-term rotational basis to meet the need.  Contractor will provide rotational (not to exceed 90 days) counseling staff for a minimum of 84 military installations/locations world-wide.  The 84 installations include all 4 military services located in the Continental United States (CONUS) and overseas (OCONUS) and specific National Guard and Reserve Component locations (see Attachment 1 for a list of locations). The staff will be sent in teams of two counselors/consultants based on the needs of the installation/location specifically around the schedule of deployments, redeployments and return/reintegration of the Service members.   The Contractor shall develop protocols for assessing need at the installation and plan for rotation that is understood by the Service.  Installations also need to be briefed on the outset that these services are to augment existing services and meet the need of all families.  Outreach/rotational counseling may also include short-term specialized programs such as the Department of Defense Education Activity and Child and Youth Program Summer Enrichment Program which operates during the summer months to support summer school, camps, and summer child and youth programs DoD-wide. The summer program counseling staff and any specialized short-term services may be sent individually rather than in a team of two. The outreach/rotational counseling services are expected to be approximately 60% of the contract. Travel, per diem and lodging will be covered for counselors/consultants living 50 miles outside of the installation where they are working.
2)	Fulltime: Counseling services delivered by full-time counselors hired by the contractor and placed on the military installation in a social service delivery program (i.e., Family Centers, Chaplains, Child or Youth Center).  The counselors providing full-time services may be credentialed by government personnel in addition to the contractor credentialing process and depends upon specific service needs and regulatory guidance.  Counselors may keep written records of counseling sessions as appropriate in accordance with service requirements.  Fulltime counseling positions may include specific pilot initiatives which may be time limited, but should not be filled with rotational staff. Fulltime positions are primarily staffed with clinical providers.  A small percentage is staffed with Personal Financial Counselors (PFM) with specific skills related to finance.  Fulltime counseling services are expected to be approximately 20% or less of the contract.  3)	On-Demand: Non-medical counseling support and psycho-educational presentations on a variety of topics focused on deployment and reintegration, communication, and grief and loss and is primarily for drill weekends and family events for the National Guard and Reserve Component.  Counseling support is requested through the military Service HQ to the contractor and OSD.  On-demand events include support for Service members and family members to include activities for children. A contractor call center for this on-demand service is recommended for commands to call to request services ensuring consultants are available to attend this primarily weekend events. On-demand support must be requested a minimum of 7 days in advance for the contractor to meet staffing and travel requirements. On-Demand services are expected to be approximately 15% of the contract. 
4)	Counseling Referrals: Counseling referrals to a network of providers for 1-6 sessions is offered within 30 minutes of the individual requesting service primarily targeted for National Guard and Reserve Component members and their families. Counseling referrals are expected to be approximately 5% or less of the contract.  These referrals shall be provided to families via a telephone hotline which can be accessed 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, year round.   The contractor shall maintain complete call logs for each call, and complete documentation of the referral, including the number of visits utilized (maximum of six per individual), cost, service provider and dates of service.  Costs of referred services shall be tracked and invoiced on a cost reimbursable basis.

PURPOSE OF THIS REQUEST AND INFORMATION SOUGHT
This RFI represents the initiation of the acquisition planning and market research phase for this requirement.  The industry input received from this RFI may be used to prepare the official solicitation package.  The Government requests recommendations, comments, concerns, and questions relating to the contemplated services from contractors that possess demonstrable and credible experience for all of the requirements listed in the SOW.

<DESC>NORTHERN VIRGINIA  SFO 07-016  -OFFICE SPACE NEEDED - U.S. GOVERNMENT will seek to satisfy NEW AND / OR SUCCEEDING LEASE REQUIREMENTS through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program during the month of MAY - OFFER SUBMISSION PERIOD OPEN MAY 1, 2008 THROUGH MAY 7, 2008.  You MUST have an active offer under the 07 Series SFOs (07-014 (DC), 07-015 (MD), and 07-016 (VA)) in order to be considered for lease award.  REQUIREMENTS: The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) is a new web application enabling the electronic offering of building space for lease to the Federal Government.  This web application is located at the following internet address:  http://aaap.ncr.gsa.gov.  In order to access this application, participants must first go to the AAAP website (at:  http://aaap.ncr.gsa.gov) and select the Register to offer space link.  Please complete the online registration and the Government will notify you by email once a Solicitation for Offers (SFO) is posted to this website.  When you receive this email notification, you can submit your online offer using the AAAP.  Offerors can typically submit offers beginning with the 1st day of the open period every month through the last day of the open period every month.  Typically, the open period will start on the 1st of the month and end on the 7th of the month, except months in which new SFOs are posted, in which case the last day of the open period will typically be the 14th of the month.  The official opening time and closing time for each offer period will be established on the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) website at aaap.ncr.gsa.gov.  The United States Government is seeking to lease, in increments of up to 100,000 BOMA Rentable Square Feet of office and related space yielding up to 90,000 ANSI/BOMA Office Area Square Feet, office space to satisfy new requirements and compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government will relocate from existing space under lease if economics involved and other factors prove to be favorable.  The cost of moving, telecommunications, alterations, impact on agency mission and other variables to be determined by the Government, will be considered in the relocation decision in order to determine the best value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards and/or combine multiple space requirements.  OCCUPANCY: Space must be ready for commencement of tenant alterations in the fall of 2008.  DELINEATED AREA:  All properties offered to the Government pursuant to SFO 07-014 must be located in Washington, DC; all properties offered to the Government pursuant to SFO 07-015 must be located in Suburban Maryland; all properties offered to the Government pursuant to SFO 07-016 must be located in Northern Virginia.  Delineated areas are clarified further in each of the respective Solicitations for Offers posted on the AAAP website.  LEASE TERM:  Up to 10 years.  POINT OF CONTACT: Matt Lynch on (202)708-6066; E-Mail: matt.lynch@gsa.gov
