<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is soliciting proposals on a full and open competition&nbsp;basis for the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP).&nbsp; The contract will be cost plus fixed fee contract&nbsp;for the conduct of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) which will include obtaining, processing, and documenting, multiple databases of varying structures; conducting research analyses, and providing technical support and training.
<p>The solicitation and any documents relating to this requirement will only be available by downloading from the Internet through www.fedbizopps.gov . Interested Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available for downloading on or about 15 days after publication of this synopsis.</p>
<p>Through voluntary partnerships with 46 State, Federal, and Industry organizations, HCUP has grown to a family of six state- and national-level databases, covering inpatient, ambulatory surgery, emergency department, and pediatric encounters. As a result, HCUP has become the largest all-payer resource of multi-year hospital discharge data from community, non-Federal, short-term (acute care), general, and specialty hospitals in the U.S. with 97 percent of all community hospital discharges in the U.S. Detailed descriptions of the project and data can be found at the HCUP Web site at: www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov .</p>
<p>Databases:<br />The HCUP databases are quite large in size and contain a core set of clinical and nonclinical information found in a typical discharge abstract including all-listed diagnoses and procedures, discharge status, patient demographics, and charges for all patients, regardless of payer (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, uninsured). The information is translated into a uniform format to facilitate both multi-State and national-State comparisons and analyses. For example, HCUP produces the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) with inpatient data from approximately 8 million hospital stays from a national sample of over 1,000 hospitals annually. Another database is the State Inpatient Databases (SID) which contain the universe of inpatient discharge abstracts from participating states. Currently, the total of all the state inpatient records in a given year is approximately 36 million.</p>
<p>Software Tools:<br />Free software tools have also been developed under HCUP such as the clinical classification software, comorbidity software, cost-to-charge ratios, and chronic condition indicator that can be used not only with the HCUP databases, but also with other administrative databases.</p>
<p>Research and Dissemination:<br />In addition to data and tools, HCUP also encompasses such activities as creating timely information from the data, providing user support, electronic documentation, centralized data distribution, technical data training, publications, and research, among others.</p>
<p>HCUP is a highly complex and multifaceted project which includes tasks such as the annual production of over 100 inpatient, ambulatory surgery, and emergency department state-level databases, three nationwide databases, over 60 publicly disseminated databases, ten software tools, seven supplemental files, numerous presentations and trainings; and support to approximately 3,000 technical assistance and data support inquiries per year. An additional focus will be placed on conducting complex clinical, economic and health services research involving detailed exploration of a healthcare-related topic using HCUP data and tools and rigorous analytic techniques.</p>
<p>AHRQ is the lead Federal agency charged with improving the quality, safety, effectiveness and efficiency of health care.&nbsp; The primary objective of HCUP is to: create and enhance a powerful source of national, state, and all-payer health care data; produce a broad set of software tools and products to facilitate the use of HCUP and other administrative data; enrich a collaborative partnership with statewide data organizations aimed at increasing the quality and use of health care data; and conduct and translate research to inform decision making and improve health care delivery.</p>
<p>The HCUP staff is to be comprised of core group of seasoned professionals with education and experience in developing, analyzing, and supporting a large scale administrative encounter-level database. This includes demonstrated experience in areas such as: data processing (inpatient and outpatient data), computing and programming, documentation, medical coding (ICD-9, ICD-10, CPT, HCPCS), clinical expertise, securing and protecting health data, expertise in health data standards and data technology, health services research and policy analysis with varied expertise and skills with data, statistical and econometric techniques, and/or clinical research, communication (oral and written), statistics, training presentations, dissemination and outreach, Web site development and maintenance, providing technical support (interfacing with public), and experience in projects that require the participation of external partners.</p>
<p>AHRQ anticipates awarding a single cost plus fixed fee award under this soliciation for a base period of 12 months, with 4 one year options and a 2 month transition period.&nbsp; The anticipated Period of Performance will begin&nbsp;in December 2012.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 15.202 - Multi-Step Process, the following information is provided for requesting capabilities and experience for the execution of multiple Basic Ordering Agreements for EAGLE requirements:<br><br>All contractor submissions must be e-mailed to USARMY.RIA.ACC.MBX.EAGLE@mail.mil NLT 1600 CST, 12 January 2012.  Any questions regarding this request should also be submitted to this e-mail address.  This notice is also being posted to the EAGLE website: http://www.aschq.army.mil/ac/aaisdus/EAGLE.aspx.<br><br>Although this is a voluntary step, all contractors are strongly encouraged to submit the requested information. <br><br>BOA Step 1 Scope Functional Areas<br><br>1. EAGLE Scope.<br>The US Army Materiel Enterprise has a requirement for full-service prime contractors to provide an integrated approach for global logistics services in support of missions such as, but not limited to; Directorates of Logistics (DOL) installations; Army Prepositioned Stocks (APS); Theater Provided Equipment (TPE); In-Theater Maintenance; Left Behind Equipment (LBE); Pre-Deployment Training Equipment (PDTE); New Equipment Training (NET); New Equipment Fielding (NEF); and Reset within the United States and OCONUS locations. The objective of the acquisition is to provide global logistics services, primarily Materiel Maintenance Services, Retail/Wholesale Supply Services, and Transportation Support Services, that meet the Army's logistics mission needs in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. The EAGLE requirements do not include plans/operations as a separate requirement, laundry/dry cleaning, dining facilities, or aviation maintenance.<br><br>In the past, many installations placed separate contracts for maintenance, supply, and transportation support services. The EAGLE acquisition strategy centralizes functional responsibility, eliminates redundancy, and maximizes efficiency by combining these three EAGLE functions into one requirement. In other words, when installation level logistics are solicited as an EAGLE requirement, award will result in a single logistics provider prime contractor responsible for all identified maintenance, supply, and transportation support services. The installations that have logistic requirements other than those within the three EAGLE functional areas may or may not have one single logistics provider performing this work. For example, the successful maintenance, supply and transportation support prime contractor for the Detroit Arsenal DOL, may or may not be the same contractor performing other potential requirements at Warren, MI.<br><br>1.1 EAGLE Functional Areas. The EAGLE functional requirements involve field level logistics and sustainment. Examples include but are not limited to the following:<br><br>1.1.1. Material Maintenance (North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 811118*): Examples of types of requirements are, but not limited to; Installation Materiel Maintenance Activity Operations, Installation Modification Work Order and Warranty program coordination, Equipment Condition Classification, Base Operation Equipment Maintenance (i.e. construction equipment, emergency equipment, etc.,)Tactical Equipment Maintenance (i.e. armament, combat platforms, ground support equipment), Corrosion Protection Programs, Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) program, and use of applicable Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS)/Army Information Systems (AIS). <br><br>1.1.2. Retail/Wholesale Supply (NAICS Code 493190*): Examples of types of requirements are, but not limited to; Supply Support Activity Management (Classes of Supply include I, II, IIIP, IV, VII and IX), Central Issue Facility Operations, Individual Chemical Equipment Management Program (ICEMP), Property Accountability, Ammunition Supply Operations and Ammunition Supply Point (ASP) Management, Installation Property Book and Equipment Management, Fuel Support (CL III Bulk), Central Receiving Point, and use of applicable Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS)/Army Information Systems (AIS).<br><br>1.1.3. Transportation Support (NAICS Code 488999*): Examples of types of requirements are - Central Travel Office, Non-tactical Equipment Management, License Equipment Operators, Railroad Operations, Household Goods Operations, Personnel & Cargo movement (Shipping and Receiving Point), Local Drayage Operations, Movement planning and Transportation Motor Pool Operations, Unit movement planning, Arrival and Departure Control Group (ADG), Installation Transportation Office, and use of applicable Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS)/Army Information Systems (AIS).<br><br>*Individual industry NAICS codes are identified as references only.<br><br>As contemplated, the EAGLE contract will be solicited under the NAICS Code 561210, Facilities Support Services.<br><br>BOA Step 1 Submission Instructions<br><br>1.0 Format for Submissions<br>Potential Offerors for the EAGLE acquisition are requested to provide the information outlined below.

<a href="mailto:oscar.m.clark.civ@mail.mil">MICC Center - Fort Eustis (Joint Base Langley-Eustis)</a>
<DESC>It is the intent of the Mission Installation Contracting Command MICC Mission Contracting Office - Fort Eustis, VA to contract for Lifelong Learning Center (LLC) for the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Office of Capability Manager (TCM) Army Training Information System (ATIS), Fort Eustis, Virginia.  <br><br>The TCM-ATIS LLC support gives TRADOC the ability to create a training and education environment that takes advantage of major developments in information technologies and training and education methodologies.  It provides the ability to support a force in transformation by providing relevant, standardized training and education, on demand, to the right Soldier, leader, or unit, at the teachable moment, regardless of location.  The LLC Project specifically addresses that portion of TRADOC's mission to train and educate the Army's Soldiers; develop leaders; and support training in units.  Key in the development of the lifelong learning process is ensuring the process is user-friendly.  All players associated with the mission to train and educate the force will improve their ability to perform their jobs and more importantly, the Soldier and leader will benefit from a process that allows them to learn, grow, and achieve in their profession throughout their career, wherever they serve.  The Lifelong Learning (LLL) blends the traditional resident education and distributed learning.  It uses the most effective mix of locations, materials, and methods delivered just in time, on demand, and are adaptive to Soldiers and leaders, and mission requirements, regardless of location.  The organizational structure for lifelong learning is a combination of hardware, software, facilities, connectivity and people providing lifelong learning materials, information and support to Department of Army (DA) Soldiers/leaders, both active and reserve, and civilians.  Distance learning and web based education and training materials are tools of lifelong learning (are subsets of Lifelong Learning).  The requirement include; (1) maintain the portals / knowledge networks (web link) from the LLC to the student, via AKO. The home page configuration is based on the AKO credentials of the Soldier/user and/or Common Access Card (CAC).  The portal is a powerful content management solution allowing the proponent to establish controls over the content of each portion of their website.  (2) Provide each LLC a digital library that supports storage of Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) and Functional Course lesson plans, programs of instruction (POIs), computer-based simulations, streaming video, and web-based training software and databases. The digital library shall also include a comprehensive search capability.  (3) Maintain 365/24/7 support desk that shall provide assistance to users and / or direct calls to Subject Matter Experts (SME) that will assist users with technical or content issues and provide other LL material support as required.  (4) The contractor shall maintain the student management database that enables the proponent institution to manage each Soldier's training plan and document his/her training progress from enlistment to end term of service (ETS)/retirement.  (5)  Provide VC support capability to reach out to remote locations to establish a relationship between the LLC and other training locations where proponent training is occurring. The VC support shall include coordinating training schedules, writing standard operating procedures (SOPs) for use of the LLC, and providing training in the use of the LLC technologies.   (6) The contractor shall deliver technology-based documentation and support for production servers, development servers, collaborative servers  (Digital Library; Staff and Faculty Collaboration), collaboration Software tools  (Virtual Meetings; Virtual Soldier Support System), Testing Servers & Software Storage and Management (Includes All Software-Based Training Content [i.e., PC-Based Simulations and Interactive Multimedia Instructional Products).  (7) Maintain Contractor program management to include overall management of the HTS program, projects, Contractor costs, Contractor personnel, quality control planning and execution, direction, and coordination and reviews.  (8) Demonstrate flexibility in the performance of the requirement.  The highly dynamic nature of the LLC mission and related perishable technologies and concepts may require some aspects of the tasks identified to be accelerated and support provided on short notice.  <br><br>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this solicitation is 541513, Computer Facilities Management Services.  The Small Business Size Standard for this NAICS is $25.5 million.  The Product Service Code is R699, Other Administrative Support Services.

<DESC>Description in English - On behalf of the Inter-American Foundation (IAF), an independent agency of the United States Government, the Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) is seeking a consultant in Mexico to provide grant data-verification services. The IAF approves approximately six to eight grants per year per country. Grants are usually awarded for a one, two, or three-year period and include the following mandatory visits: a Data Verifier orientation visit, a verification visit every six months, and a final visit after the project has closed. Most grants are for a three-year period; therefore, over the life of a three-year grant the Contractor shall visit the grantee approximately seven times. It is estimated that each visit to a grantee takes approximately 5 days, including preparing for the visit (contacting grantee, reading grant documentation, copying reports), travel time, interviews with the grantee and its beneficiaries, and drafting visit reports. This requirement includes the following tasks: contractor shall train grantees in the use of the IAF data collection instrument; train grantees on data collection strategies; assist grantees in the selection of indicators that present problems in collecting the required data; document and verify grant results with grantees, beneficiaries, and grantees' partners; draft reports documenting data verification visit findings; and write project history reports for terminating grants. In addition, when requested by the IAF, contractor shall accompany the IAF staff and Contractors on field trips; provide grant results verification services in other countries; and participate in training and/or conferences. The Contractor shall possess the necessary language abilities applicable to the country, which is Spanish. The Contractor shall have a physical presence in Mexico and be willing to travel to remote areas of the countries to conduct fieldwork at the grantees' physical location or where grant activities are taking place.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Education (Department) has a requirement for support and assistance to the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) in carrying out the development of a a ten-year evaluation plan and accompanying tools for evaluation of the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) and its various programs. The specific purpose of this contract is to identify a set of ongoing activities, timelines, measures and data sources to assess the degree of success of NIDRR programs in producing outputs and outcomes that meet NIDRR mission, goals and objectives. The plan may include both internally and externally managed processes, but must include significant attention to a program of ongoing internally managed processes. Internally managed processes refer to evaluation activities that can be completed by NIDRR staff without assistance by outside contractors. Externally managed processes refer to activities undertaken by an external, independent source to evaluate NIDRR-funded outputs and outcomes. The plan should be based on a ten-year cycle and include a description of evaluation activities and suggested timelines for implementing those activities. The plan should also include recommendations about needed data collections and supporting systems. The action plan should be sufficiently detailed as to allow NIDRR staff to engage in internal evaluation processes with minimal start up time, and to guide NIDRR staff effort in designing the specification for RFPs for any recommended externally managed processes.</p>
<p><br />This procurement will be issued using the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulations FAR Subsection 6.102(b), and Section 12.203 and Part 15.</p>
<p><br />The contractor must demonstrate expertise in research and development programs which includes reporting structures, oversight techniques, audit or site visit schedules, and /or assessment of program data quality so that NIDRR can use the findings from this evaluation plan to increase accountability and improve grantee management.</p>
<p><br />It is anticipated that the Request for Proposals (RFP) will be posted on or about April 2, 2012. A firm fixed price base contract with option year is anticipated. Contract award is planned no later than June 30, 2012.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a sole source synopsis for the acquisition of a five month performance period extension, 01 May 2012 to 30 September 2012, for current Unclassified IT Support and Services (UITSS) contract HR0011-06-D-0001 with Wyle Information Systems, for commercial Information Technology services in support of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Support Services Office (SSO) Information Technology Services (ITS) support and services effort. In accordance with the authority at FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements", DARPA intends to negotiate a contract modification for the three month extension. This announcement constitutes the only synopsis for this requirement and is issued for notification purposes only.</p>
<p>The current support services are set to expire on 30 April 2012 and the release of the Request For Proposal for the follow-on effort was delayed. The five month contract extension will allow sufficient time to conduct a competitive solicitation and allow for adequate turnover of duties to a follow-on contractor. Having Wyle Information Systems continue providing the support services for the five month period is necessary because DARPA SSO/ITS requires a team of individuals that is familiar with the current DARPA IT environment and strategic plan in order to provide full-spectrum Information Technology (IT) Services including network and security architecture, file storage and backup, email and scheduling, server, desktop, laptop and printer provisioning and support, COTS and Legacy application provisioning and support, software development, Web page development and support, and configuration management for Agency personnel (approximately 1000 customers). On 7 March 2012, U.S. Army ACC-APG-RTP published a Request for Proposal with solicitation number W911NF-12-R-0002 on FedBizOpps for the subsequent acquisition of the commercial Information Technology services. The deadline to receive proposals is 6 April 2012.</p>

CONDUCT SITE STUDY OF UNDERGROUND
WATER & SEWER INFRASTRUCTURE

GENERAL SCOPE:  The primary focus of the work is to provide an in-depth study of the facility's underground water and sewer utilities to provide complete investigation and upgrade recommendations for these site utilities at the G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery VA Medical Center campus, Jackson, MS.  The study will include, but not limited to, information gathering, site investigation, and system design.  The evaluation shall note any deficiencies within the systems and provide recommendations for corrections.  
The existing water service includes an 8" main loop around the facility site with several taps to feed into various the buildings.  The water loop also feeds the site fire protection system (including both fire hydrants and building fire protection systems, through post indicator valves (PIV) and fire pumps).  The existing loop is connected to the facility's well and elevated tank system, as well as two city water main feeds (valves are currently closed to city mains, connection is for emergency backup only). [Water loop is ~4600' in length, with approximately 5 building feeds, 6 PIV fire connections (including 2 fire pump feeds), and 10 fire hydrants]
The facility sewer system is divided into separate sanitary and storm sewer systems.  The sanitary sewer ranges in size from 8" to 12", serves all the facility buildings, and connects to a single point of discharge from the site.  There is approximately 4000' of sanitary lines serving the site, connected thru approximately 27 manholes.  The storm sewer system ranges from 6" to 36" and discharges from the buildings in multiple, decentralized feeds into various collection and run-off locations.  There is approximately 8000' of storm sewer serving the site, connected thru approximately 20 manholes.   
A.	Conduct necessary site survey to identify extents and locations of the underground water and sewer systems.  In addition, perform required survey to identify all utilities, roads, sidewalks, curbs, and other features that would affect the design of replacement system components or system repair services.  
B.	Perform sewer pipe camera inspection of all exterior storm and sanitary mains.  Confirm location of manholes, clean-outs, etc.  Provide a complete report, including a video record, which identifies all damaged sections or potential problems within the system.  
C.	Provide plans and specifications for work required to repair (either by sleeving or replacement) of items identified by the above sewer system inspection.
D.	Provide plans and specifications for design of a replacement domestic water distribution loop.  New system to include, but is not limited to, new backflow preventers and meters at connections to City of Jackson mains, connections to all existing building feeds/fire service feeds, and connection to the existing well and elevated tank system.  New distribution system to be constructed with C900 piping and mechanical joint fittings (or an alternative piping system, upon VA approval).  Evaluate existing demands and potential future needs (of up to 250,000 square feet of building addition) to properly size the new loop.  
E.	All repair or replacement design shall include all road patching, sidewalk/curb/gutter replacement, and road/parking striping, as required by the installation work.
F.	Distribution loop design shall include multiple isolation valves, throughout the loop, to allow for sections of loop to be isolated for repairs, while minimizing the overall system disruption.
G.	Distribution loop design shall be modular in nature to allow for installation of sections in multiple, smaller phases, over time as allowed by future funding availability.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to conduct a full and open competition under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (a) and in accordance with FAR Part 15 for the Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) Technology Development (TD) contract. NAVAIR does not intend to use the provisions of FAR Part 12 for this acquisition. The objective of the TD phase is to develop a cost effective jammer system to enhance aircraft survivability. NGJ is an electronic attack system that will provide significantly improved Airborne Electronic Attack capabilities against advanced threats through enhanced agility and precision within jamming assignments, increased interoperability and expanded broadband capability for greater threat coverage against a wide variety of radio frequency emitters. Initially, the NGJ system will be integrated on the EA-18G tactical aircraft to replace aging ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System pods.<br /><br />The successful offeror in the TD phase will be required to mature and demonstrate critical technologies, complete the system architecture, and complete the requirements derivation and decomposition to subsystems. The TD phase will include: (1) Technology Readiness Assessments (TRAs) that substantiate Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 for Increment 1 (mid-band) Critical Technology Elements (CTEs); (2) System Designs to a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) to establish the functional and allocated baselines for Increment 1; and (3) Refining technical trade space including those to improve affordability, system efficiency, and host platform compatibility. <br /><br />The Government intends to release a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) in early April 2012, including sections L&amp;M. Industry input will be sought prior to the release of the Formal RFP in mid June 2012. Proposals will be required 60 days after Formal RFP release. <br /><br />Publicly releasable unclassified documentation such as the RFP sections A-M will be posted directly on the NAVAIR Open Solicitation Homepage website (http://www.navair.navy.mil/) and listed under "Business Opportunities/Open Solicitations" as solicitation number N00019-12-R-0035. All subsequent RFP amendments and publicly releasable documentation will reside on the NAVAIR Open Solicitation Homepage and will not be posted to any other website. <br /><br />Unclassified documentation with distribution statement restrictions such as the Statement of Work and Contract Data Requirement s Lists (CDRLs) will be made available through a secure website that will serve as an unclassified virtual bidder's technical library. Other documentation to include Industry Day briefs, the voluntary interested vendors list, and Industry Day Questions &amp; Answers will be posted to this library as well. Access to this library will be restricted to potential Prime Contractors. Upon request, classified documentation such as the updated System Performance Specification classified appendix will be shipped as CD/ROM via approved means. The list of all classified documentation will be hosted on the technical library along with procedures for access to these documents. Potential Contractors are asked to submit comments, questions, and requests for additional information directly to Kara Briscoe at kara.briscoe@navy.mil or by phone at (301)-757-7086.<br /><br />Please note that potential Prime contractors will need a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate and NAVAIR Applications (APPS) domain account to access the unclassified virtual bidder's external library. If a potential contractor does not already possess a PKI, please consult the following site for details on how to obtain a compliant Medium Assurance PKI certificate: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html. Be advised that this process can nominally take several weeks to complete. <br /><br />Potential Contractors must meet the requirements of the DD 254, Contract Security Classification Specification. To request access to the secure web site and to request transmittal of the classified documentation, potential Prime Contractors must contact the contract specialist, Kara Briscoe at kara.briscoe@navy.mil, with the following information: Company name, classified mailing address, phone number, email address (if available), current CAGE number, DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) number and acknowledgement of the contractor's responsibility under the U.S. export control laws and regulations. Potential contractors shall acknowledge that no dissemination of any export-controlled technical data subject to this requirement will occur in a manner that would violate applicable export control laws and regulations (DD Form 2345). Upon review of your written request, verification of your status and acknowledgement of the contractor's responsibility under the U.S. Export laws and regulations, the classified documentation, APPS account application and web site access instructions (https://www site address, user name, and password) will be provided. <br /><br />Offerors shall be required to have completed the design effort for a NGJ system prototype prior to entry into TD. The Government will evaluate only those offerors' proposals that include a copy of a NAVAIR Design Readiness Review 2 (DRR2) letter stating that the exit criteria for a DRR2 has been met, establishing a product baseline for the offeror's NGJ system prototype. DRR2 is a tailored version of a Critical Design Review (CDR). The DRR2 will ensure a reasonable expectation of characterizing operational effectiveness and suitability of the design, and a plan to demonstrate technical maturity of at least a TRL 6 by the end of TD. Entry Criteria for the DRR2 shall be in accordance with the DRR2 checklist (tailored NAVAIR SETR CDR checklist). The DRR2, as a minimum, shall include: Mutually agreed to topics from the DRR2 entry criteria, presentation of the Product Baseline, and CTE Technology Readiness Assessment. Firms that have not conducted a DRR2 but are interested in competing as a TD Prime Contractor must contact Kara Briscoe at kara.briscoe@navy.mil, or by phone at (301)-757-7086, no later than 29 June 2012 to obtain the DRR2 checklist and schedule a design review. <br /><br />Any prospective offeror who believes that their NGJ TD proposal will require submission of information protected as Special Access Required (SAR) or Special Compartmented Information (SCI) must contact their SAR or SCI Sponsor and the Department of the Navy Special Access Programs Coordinator [N89-Steve Kiepe (703-692-9305) or N89B-CAPT Rick Watson (703-693-2305)] for SAR program related requests or the PEO(T) Intelligence Officer (Pete Crosby 301-342-6307) for SCI related requests as early as possible. This is in order to allow the appropriate coordination to occur as early as possible and to gain the requisite approval from the SAR or SCI Sponsor, prior to any submittal of SAR/SCI information. Upon approval of the SAR or SCI Sponsor, specific instructions for submission of SAR/SCI information will be provided. Interested parties are advised that any classified submission will be subject to review with the SAR or SCI Sponsor.<br /><br />After release of the draft RFP, prospective prime contractors with their respective subcontractor teams may request one-on-one meetings with the Government to be conducted the week of 23 April. Requests to schedule a one-on-one meeting are to be made to Kara Briscoe (kara.briscoe@navy.mil, or by phone at (301)-757-7086) no later than 16 April 2012.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Patuxent River, MD intends to negotiate and award a contract on a sole source basis to L-3 Communications Vertex Aerospace LLC to extend current support efforts for TH-57 Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) under contract number N00019-12-D-0003, which consists of all maintenance, logistics services and materials necessary to provide for Organizational (O) and Depot (D) level maintenance required to support and maintain the TH-57 aircraft located at Naval Air Station (NAS) Whiting Field, FL and Depot and supply support for TH-57 aircraft at Patuxent River, MD. <br />
<p><br />The TH-57 Training System (TH57TS) consists of a five seat, turbine powered, light utility helicopter utilized by Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) as the Navy's Undergraduate Helicopter Pilot Trainer (UHPT). There are a total of 126 TH-57 aircraft in active inventory. Of these 126 aircraft, CNATRA is the Aircraft Controlling Custodian (ACC) for 124 TH-57 aircraft which are located at Naval Air Station (NAS) Whiting Field, Florida. All maintenance, logistics support, and pilot services for the TH-57 aircraft are provided through Contractor Logistics Support (CLS). The aircraft is maintained in compliance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, Government directives, and instructions for O and D levels of maintenance.</p>
<p><br />The resultant Indefinite Delivery Requirements type contract will commence on 1 October 2012 and will consist of&nbsp;a 6 month base and a 3 month option. NAVAIR intends to award this TH-57 CLS effort to L-3 Communications Vertex Aerospace LLC, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements). To mitigate the risk that award for the competitive follow on contract might be after 30 September 2012, award of a sole source contract to the current performing contractor is necessary in order to continue to meet CNATRA's training mission. A gap of CLS support would result in a negative impact to Naval Aviation readiness.</p>
<p><br />This notice of intent is not a request for proposals. This sole source synopsis is provided for informational purposes only.</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.
The project will relocate the Sterile Processing and Distribution (SPD) department from the basement of Building 31 to a new building with direct connection to the operating suite on the fourth floor of Building 31.  The existing SPD location will be minimally renovated for reuse as storage space.  Approximately 1,600 sf of the OR suite will be reconfigured to allow access to the pedestrian bridge.  The 155 foot long, two story, pedestrian bridge will allow for direct communication and immediate access between the operating suites and the sterilization department located on the same floor.  Separate clean and dirty circulation paths have been provided between hospital services and the new building.  The new building is 18,441 GSF, approx. 8,500 of which are dedicated to house the Sterile Processing and Distribution department.  A four story addition to the east wing of Building 31 will feature a four story egress stair and elevator addition of approximately 830 square feet per floor.  The project will connect to all floors of Building 31.
The top story of the new building houses the SPD department.  The primary function of which is to decontaminate, sterilize and store the required instrumentation, and supplies for the OR suite and other uses around the hospital.  The equipment to be relocated to this space, under this contract, include walk-through sterilizers, an ETO sterilizer, decontamination washers and various stainless steel countertops, sinks and equipment.  This building includes a 5,000 lb pedestrian elevator for the transport of clean linen and supplies to the SPD department from warehouse level.  
Warehousing, which supports all of the shipping; receiving and distribution of goods throughout the hospital will be located on the ground floor of the addition and will connect to the hospital with a designated bridge on the third floor.  It will house a 'high bay' warehouse, loading docks and offices for the general storage of goods for use in the facility.  
The building site is located to the east of Building 31. The pedestrian bridge crosses an existing intra-campus road, large parking area and loading dock access courtyard for Building 31.  The building site has a steep cross-grade which requires an extensive cut into the existing banking for the building footprint as well as the truck drive and turn around area.  Vehicular access is limited to the north end of the site and is designed to accommodate the maneuvering of large trucks into position for the two standard loading dock bays.  The truck area features an extensive large block style retaining wall and underground chambered storm water management system.  
The Building 31 addition houses two 5,000lb pedestrian elevators to allow the distribution of clean and dirty goods to the various floors of the building 31.  A new 4 story stair is included to replace the existing stair slated to be demolished to make room for the bridge connection.  The renovated area will include relocating an existing AHU to the roof of the existing SPD department, relocation of site utilities and relocating existing sprinkler, plumbing and electrical risers in the existing building.
The project includes sustainable building practices with the incorporation of a high performance building envelope, energy efficient mechanical and electrical systems, low VOC material choices, building upon the VA design guidelines and Space Planning Criteria.  The project includes, but is not limited to, the following trades:  site work, structural steel, spray fireproofing, concrete placement, masonry, mechanical, electrical, insulated metal panel envelope, elevators, epoxy flooring, quartz tile flooring and sheet vinyl flooring, HM doors, frames and hardware and roofing. 
The project requires extra attention to the phasing and coordination of work to maintain the operation of critical hospital function.  It is expected that certain portions of the work will require night and weekend work to minimize disruption to the hospital and operating suite.  One such example would be the drilling of elevator shafts adjacent to Building 31.  Access to and use of the intra-campus road, O2 tank farm and Building 31 loading dock will be required to be maintained, all disruptions will be coordinated with the VA contracting officer's representative.  All existing campus buildings will remain occupied throughout the duration of the project.

<DESC>The CTII system creates a network that links aircraft with each other and with ground stations. SIPRNET users can log into the CTII network using a computer loaded with Tracker software, send/receive messages, and track CTII-equipped aircraft. The CTII system has roll-on/off capability for multiple aircraft platforms. Within each satellite footprint, a single CTII is configured as a Control and Relay Station (CRS). In this mode, the equipment operates as the network master for a satellite channel and defines the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) frame boundaries by periodically transmitting a start-of-frame message. The other CTIIs within the satellite footprint are configured as In-Transit Units (ITUs). ITUs log-in with the CRS and are assigned a time slot within the frame for transmitting GPS-based position reports. Other portions of the frame are available for text messages, tactical information, and other types of data.

<DESC>BACKGROUND:  Product Manager - Soldier Protective Equipment (PM SPE) is seeking sources and information relating to the possible production of Tier I - Protective Under Garment (PUG).  The prevalence of IEDs during dismounted operations in Operation Enduring Freedom is causing a greater number of injuries to the lower body such as blast injuries surrounding the groin area affecting the colon, femoral artery, and genitalia.  The current Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) add-on groin protector equipment only offers protection from frontal threats.  PM-SPE believes a two-tiered system will provide the optimal combination of protection and user acceptance. The Tier I - PUG, part of the Pelvic Protection System, is an item that will provide protection against ground based IED threats.   The PUG is worn next to the skin and provides protection of the pelvis, femoral arteries, and lower abdominal organs in a blast or fragmentation event.  The PUG will also help reduce the penetration of dirt and fine debris into a wound area thus aiding in infection prevention.<br><br>II.PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS:<br><br>At a minimum, the Tier I Protective Under Garment (PUG): <br><br>-Shall provide the Soldier with femoral artery and soft tissue protection, including the genitals, perineum, anus, and inner thigh against sand, debris, and small fragmentation threats.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center is hereby soliciting information about potentialsources for Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) Hosted Payload Opportunities (HPO) andAccommodations.BackgroundNASAs Earth Science Division (ESD) will be developing Earth Science Instruments, some ofwhich may be suitable to fly as hosted payloads on HPOs. The development of theinstruments as well as the HPOs will be conducted independently of each other with thegoal of matching a specific instrument with a specific HPO by the instrument PreliminaryDesign Review (PDR) timeframe. In an effort to facilitate matching instruments to HPOs, ESD initiated the CommonInstrument Interface (CII) Project. The charter for the CII Project is to work withindustry, academia, and other governmental agencies to develop a set of commoninstrument-to-spacecraft interfaces that could serve as guidelines for instrumentdevelopers. If used properly by instrument developers, these guidelines would helpproduce instruments that have a less complex interface and would improve the probabilityof matching a given instrument with a HPO or platform.The CII Project has recently completed a draft set of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) guidelinesand a draft HPO Database document. Additional information on the CII project may be foundat this website:http://science.nasa.gov/about-us/smd-programs/earth-system-science-pathfinder/common-instrument-interface-workshop/. Current CII Guideline and HPO database documents may be foundon the Earth Venture Instruments 1 Program Library:http://essp.larc.nasa.gov/EV-I/evi_programlibrary.htmlCurrent IntentionThe CII Project is now interested in identifying HPOs, and their associatedaccommodations, for future GEO missions in order to develop a draft set of GEO guidelinesto complement our LEO guidelines, and to update the publically-available HPO databasedocument. Additionally, the CII Project is investigating flying and operating a hostedpayload on an upcoming GEO HPO as a pathfinder initiative (hereafter described as theInitiative) to better understand the programmatic and technical challenges for acommercially-hosted NASA science payload.  The CII Project would document lessons learnedfrom conducting the GEO pathfinder initiative and feed them back into the GEO guidelinesdocument to help developers intending to fly a payload on a future GEO HPO.The purpose of this RFI is to:1)	Identify the GEO HPOs for the period from 2013-2023;2)	Obtain a description of available HPO payload accommodations on future GEO HPOs;and3)	Obtain information on all of the steps required to fly the Initiative asdescribed later in this RFI.The CII Project can accommodate responses containing properly-marked proprietaryinformation.  The CII Project will safeguard the proprietary information on hostedpayload opportunities (Requested Information #1) and payload accommodations (RequestedInformation #2) within the Project organization.  The CII Project intends to utilize thenon-proprietary portions of Requested Information #1 to update the publicly available HPOdatabase.  The CII Project intends to use Requested Information #2 to bound/envelope thepayload accommodation parameters that will inform the future GEO Guidelines Document. NASA may also use Requested Information #1 and #2 to assess the suitability of hostedpayload-to-spacecraft matches associated with future NASA Earth Science missions.The CII Project will use the requested information for the GEO pathfinder initiative(Requested Information #3 above) to assess the feasibility of such an Initiative, toprovide an overview of the hosted payload process in the future GEO Guidelines Document,and to inform future Earth Science hosted payload planning and programming activities.Requested Information1. Please identify your organizations HPOs for the period of 2013-2023 with theirassociated mission parameters including but not limited to:	Mission Name	Launch Date	Owner/Operator	Primary Customer	Spacecraft Bus Manufacturer	Spacecraft Bus Model	Launch Vehicle	Orbital LongitudeIf the data are not available beyond your current business cycle, please suggest atechnique for the CII Project to obtain those data once they do become available.2. Please describe what Payload Accommodation and Interface resources your HPOs canprovide to a prospective hosted payload without significant modifications to your nominalmanufacturing, integration, test and launch processes.	Please also describe theenvironment the prospective hosted payload might expect to encounter:	Payload Accommodation Parameters and Interfaceo	Maximum Payload Mass Available without System Redesign [kg]o	Maximum Payload Orbital Average Power without System Redesign [W]o	Maximum Payload Peak Power without System Redesign[W]o	Main Bus Nominal Voltage [V]o	Volume (l x w x h) [mm x mm x mm]o	Sensor Mounting Location on Spacecraft (e.g. Nadir, Zenith, Ram, Wake, North,South, East, West, )o	Command and Control Interface (1553B, RS-422, SpaceWire, etc.) with average andpeak data rates [kbps]o	Payload-to-Transponder Interface (RS-422, SpaceWire, etc.) for Science DataTransmission with average and peak data rates [Mbps]o	Host spacecraft constraints or preferences for digital formats most suitable forconversion to RF in system architectureo	Payload command and control encryption requirementso	Pointing Control  [arcsec]o	Pointing Knowledge [arcsec]o	Pointing Stability [arcsec / sec]o	Spacecraft absolute position accuracy, each axis [m]o	Spacecraft absolute velocity accuracy, each axis [m/s]o	Limitations with respect to payload-induced uncompensated torques [N x m] byfrequency [Hz]o	Limitations with respect to payload-induced uncompensated forces [N] by frequency[Hz]o	Typical Integration and Test Facility Cleanliness [Cleanroom Class]o	Thermal Rejection With Heat Pipes [W]o	Thermal Rejection Without Heat Pipes [W]	Payload Environmento	Temperature Rangeo	Quasi-static loadso	Minimum resonant frequencyo	Random vibration and acoustic loadso	Shock environmento	Disturbance torqueo	RF Field EMI/EMC/ESDo	Molecular contamination as a function of mission elapsed time and hosted payloadlocation3.  As a specific potential near term opportunity, please provide information on all ofthe programmatic and technical steps required to fly a GEO Pathfinder Initiative on yourHPOs as described below.GEO Pathfinder Initiative InformationThe Initiative will also provide NASA with experience with the commercially-hostedpayload process.  The Initiative will also mitigate space environmental risks to futureGEO missions by measuring vibration and contamination of an Instrument Suite hosted on acommercial GEO spacecraft.  Both objectives will reduce risk on futurecommercially-hosted GEO Earth Science missions.  See attached Figure 1 for an example ofa notional Instrument Suite, which the CII Project will develop and provide, with thefollowing characteristics:	Mass: 50 kg	Power: 125 W	Volume: 1000 x 500 x 500 mm	Data Rate: 60 Mbps	Thermal Control: Electronics thermally isolated, with exterior boxes insulatedwith multi-layer insulation (MLI).	The Instrument Suite is presumed to be mounted on the host spacecraft nadir deck.	The Instrument Suite has a nominal operational lifetime of 3 yearsNote: The Initiative is designed to exercise the GEO hosted payload process whoseparameters are a subset and likely smaller than those of a typical future science flightmission.GEO Pathfinder Initiative Requested InformationPlease provide information related to the accommodation of the Instrument Suite by yourmission:	Date the contract needs to be signed relative to Launch Date	Government-provided technical / programmatic deliverables required (e.g. mass andthermal models)	Instrument Suite delivery date required relative to Launch Date	Rough Order of Magnitude Price Estimate to fly and operate the Initiative.  Inaddition to the Total price, please estimate the following components:o	Integration, Test, and Launcho	Operations	Any concerns with FAR Part 12 terms and conditions:https://acquisition.gov/far/html/FARTOCP12.html	Concept of operating hosted payload, including communications architecture	Safety and mission assurance requirements levied upon hosted payload 	The level of NASA participation allowed during spacecraft development andinstrument integration (e.g. spacecraft design reviews, environmental tests, etc.)NASA is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, SmallDisadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service DisabledVeteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) forthe purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small businesssubcontracting goals.

<DESC><br />BACKGROUND
<p>The overall objective of the VITA Program is to enable and accelerate the development of promising diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for certain diseases within the purview of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). In that context the NHLBI has identified two "opportunity gaps" in the early stages of the development process by which new medical research is translated into new medical products.</p>
<p>The first gap occurs between the conceptualization of potential medical advances and the experimental validation of those concepts as medical product candidates (designated as the "Concept to Proof-of-Principle" stage).</p>
<p>The second gap resides between the demonstration of proof of principle and the completion of studies required for the assessment of a product candidate in human clinical trials (designated as the "Proof-of-Principle to IND/IDE" stage).</p>
<p>The term "product candidate", as it concerns the VITA Program, is used to refer to new diagnostics, new therapeutic interventions (agents or devices), or novel applications of existing therapeutic interventions. The product candidate(s) under study and development can include, but are not limited to: small molecules, small peptides, proteins or antibodies, devices, diagnostic tests, imaging probes, genetic markers, and cell or gene agents.</p>
<p>The VITA Program will provide support for early-stage translational development of product candidates in the fields of vascular disorders, thrombotic diseases, and pulmonary hypertension. Proposed project areas of interest may include peripheral arterial disease, aortic aneurysms and dissections, pulmonary vascular disorders, venous and arterial thrombosis, thromboembolic disorders, and disorders of the lymphatic system. Not included as specific topics in this program are diseases of the coronary and intracranial arteries.</p>
<p>ACQUISITION PLAN</p>
<p>This acquisition will employ a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) solicitation to seek proposals for two (2) different study stages e.g. concept to proof of principle (POP) and proof of principle to investigational new drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE). This BAA will be repeated in a second round in FY-2016. Although, the same number of awards and funding are planned in the second round, the NHLBI reserves the right to revisit this issue based on the results of the first BAA round. Up to six (6) contracts (with, up to 3-year duration each) are planned for the Stage-1 awards and up to three (3) contracts (with, up to 3-year duration each) are planned for the Stage-2 awards. A total of $10.8M is available for these two (2) BAA rounds (i.e. $5.4M in FY-2013 and $5.4M in FY-2016). A BAA is not eligible for any small business set-aside program.</p>
<p>Companion to this BAA solicitation, is a request for proposals (RFP) solicitation for a Program Coordinating Center (PCC) to award a single contract to provide project management, meeting coordination, and regulatory advice for the awarded BAA contractors that require such services. The RFP solicitation for the VITA PCC is being synopsized in a separate Sources Sought Notice. Interested Offerors should look for it elsewhere in the FEDBIZOPPS.</p>
<p>The BAA and the RFP solicitations are planned for issuance in late May 2012, with proposals due in late August 2012. Awards are planned for September 2013.</p>
<p>Further details regarding the VITA program may be found at: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/faq-NHLBIVITA.htm</p>
<p>EVALUATION PLAN</p>
<p>Awards for the BAA solicitation will be made based on weighted evaluation factors of technical merit, programmatic balance, and funds availability. Individual award amounts are expected to vary depending on the scope and capacity of the technical objectives and statements of work proposed by the Offerors.</p>

Proposed project areas of interest may include peripheral arterial disease, aortic aneurysms and dissections, pulmonary vascular disorders, venous and arterial thrombosis, thromboembolic disorders, and disorders of the lymphatic system. Not included as specific topics in this program are diseases of the coronary and intracranial arteries.</p>
<p>The VITA Program will provide support for early-stage translational development of diagnostic and therapeutic product candidates. In this program, "product candidate" refers to new diagnostics, new therapeutic agents, or novel applications of existing agents and/or therapeutic interventions. The product candidate(s) under study and development can include, but are not limited to: small molecules, small peptides, proteins or antibodies, imaging probes, devices, diagnostic tests, genetic markers, and cell or gene agents.</p>
<p>VITA is designed to fund proposals that fall under one of two broad early stages of product development: 1.) those projects seeking support for experimental research in the window between discovery and the demonstration of "proof of principle (POP) in the form of various preclinical efficacy assessments and preliminary safety evaluations, and 2.) those proposals for further development and testing of product candidates with established proof of principle, such as studies that are required to support an application for the initiation of human clinical trials (such as an IND or IDE application).</p>
<p>The primary objective of the PCC is to serve as the focal point for the coordination of the VITA Program. The PCC will work with the investigative sites and the NHLBI to ensure that the funded research projects are on track to meet defined milestones along the translational pathway. The responsibilities of the PCC include, but are not limited to, the coordination of Program meetings, teleconferences, and possible site visits; logistical management of the EAC (External Advisory Committee); providing Project Management guidance and oversight to the research sites; providing Regulatory Support to the research site investigators; assisting investigators in identifying and securing additional research and development resources; and conducting in-service training/instruction sessions as needed to the various Program components.</p>
<p>The main roles of the PCC will be to ensure efficient project management at the research sites, provide regulatory support to the research sites, and to coordinate the meetings and overall workings of the VITA Program. As long as the PI/Supervisory Project Manager and the Primary Project Manager have demonstrated track records of successful experience in the management and oversight of multi-component scientific or clinical programs, certification in the field of project management is not required. Additionally, while potentially helpful, it is not imperative that the PI/Supervisory Project Manager or the Primary Project Manager have a background in the biological sciences.</p>
<p>Specifically the PCC shall:</p>
<p>1. Schedule and coordinate the logistics of the VITA Investigators meetings, meetings of the External Advisory Committee (EAC), teleconferences, any site visits conducted by PCC and NHLBI staff, and any other face-to-face meetings between NHLBI, the EAC, and PCC, and research investigators as needed.</p>
<p>2. The PCC will work with the NHLBI to establish an External Advisory Committee (EAC) composed of up to seven members who are not affiliated or in conflict with the research sites. The PCC will be responsible for ensuring that the proper Conflict of Interest forms/disclosures have been obtained from EAC members.</p>
<p>3. From the outset of the program, the PCC should work with all of the investigative sites to facilitate the establishment of accepted standards for terminologies, data elements, methodologies, and assessments to the extent feasible in the projects.</p>
<p>4. Provide Project Management assistance and oversight to the investigative sites, by participating as a member on each individual Steering Committee. The PCC Contractor shall maintain an updated summary of the activities related to the research projects and regularly apprise the NHLBI of the progress towards the milestones on each research project.</p>
<p>5. Establish a plan for regular meetings or teleconferences with NHLBI to review and discuss the status of the ongoing projects and any outstanding matters in the VITA program.</p>
<p>6. The PCC should develop a system for receiving, reviewing, prioritizing, and tracking requests for regulatory or other types of assistance from the investigative centers. When necessary, the NHLBI can assist the PCC in prioritizing these requests. The PCC must get NHLBI approval before beginning work on any request(s) that could potentially consume an inordinate amount of time and resources.</p>
<p>7. Develop and maintain a private, password-protected website for internal use only to facilitate communications between the VITA Program participants, NHLBI, and EAC members</p>
<p>8. Gather the information from investigators and maintain a database of information regarding publications, presentations, invention disclosures, companies formed, and patents, copyrights, or trademarks applied for or awarded, or any other significant achievements that resulted from work supported by or conducted in the VITA Program</p>
<p>9. Ensure that the investigative sites have up-to-date versions of all required certifications, inspections, and assurances required for the type of work they are performing (e.g., animal or human protections certifications) and ensure that these are available for review if NHLBI were to conduct a site visit. At a minimum, these updates should be on a yearly basis, but more frequent updates may be required.</p>
<p>10. The PCC will schedule and coordinate the logistics of meetings and teleconferences for the NHLBI-appointed EAC. The annual face-to-face EAC meeting will be held in conjunction with the annual VITA Investigator's meeting in the general Bethesda-Rockville-Gaithersburg, Maryland area. The PCC will be responsible for ensuring that the proper Conflict of Interest forms/disclosures have been obtained from EAC members.</p>
<p>11. Manage and coordinate travel-related expense reimbursements (airfare, hotel, and the standard government per diem and honoraria payments as applicable) for up to seven EAC members attending face-to-face meetings or participating in teleconferences</p>
<p>12. Assist investigators as needed in identifying and applying for services or support from other NIH resource programs such as, but not limited to, Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) centers, the Gene Therapy Resource Program (GTRP), Science Moving towArds Research Translation and Therapy (SMARTT), and resources offered by the NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)</p>
<p>13. Assist Investigators as needed to identify sources for capabilities or services not readily available at the research site or through an NIH program such as, but not limited to, pharmacokinetic or toxicology testing, high throughput screening, chemical libraries, product formulation or production, or provision of a marketed drug or placebo matching services.<br /><br />14. Develop and maintain a Manual of VITA Operations and Procedures (MOP) describing the operating procedures of the VITA program, including any standard operating procedures (SOPs) related to the PCC's interactions with the research sites, the EAC, and the NHLBI.</p>
<p>15. Arrange the logistics for one potential "for cause" site visit by the NHLBI and up to two PCC staff to one research site per year.</p>
<p>16. Work with the NHLBI to develop any informational materials about the VITA Program for display and distribution; securing exhibitor space and staffing an exhibit booth if requested by NHLBI for up to one scientific meeting per year; work with other NIH Institutes, Centers, or Offices on collaborative efforts to advance translational research on vascular diseases; assist NHLBI in the preparation of materials for presentation by NLHBI staff at various meetings; and assisting the NHLBI in planning and executing the logistics of meetings, seminars, or symposia related to the VITA Program or other NIH translational research programs</p>
<p>17. Provide Regulatory Affairs support to the research investigators as requested. Such support may include, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>a. Assisting investigators in scheduling meetings and preparing the materials for the meetings/teleconferences with oversight bodies such as the FDA (e.g. pre-pre-IND or pre-IND meetings), IRB, IBC, NIH-OBA, DSMB, and the EAC.</p>
<p>b. Assisting the investigators in the preparation and submission of required reports to the oversight bodies.</p>
<p>c. Assisting investigators in the preparation and submission of an IND or IDE application in compliance with 21CFR312 and 21CFR812, respectively.</p>
<p>d. Ensure that all required approvals from oversight bodies are in place prior to the conduct of the relevant research.</p>
<p>e. Assist investigators at research sites with the preparation or management of materials for the conduct of a clinical study or trial such as, but not limited to: a Manual of Operations/Procedures (MOP); other site management materials; submission of copies of the clinical protocol to the relevant oversight bodies and the NHLBI, and ensuring submission of the required reports to the oversight bodies.</p>
<p>f. Assist research sites conducting clinical trials by offering regulatory support services such as pre-initiation site visits, study monitoring, site-initiation and periodic site visits by the PCC, close-out visits, or other technical regulatory support, even if this requires the PCC to sub-contract these services.</p>
<p>g. Ensure that any applicable clinical trials are registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov web site.</p>
<p>h. Providing general instruction or education in regulatory affairs matters to the investigative sites as needed or requested by either the site or by NHLBI</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."</p>
<p>The information from this market research will help the DMID, NIAID, NIH, and DHHS, plan their acquisition strategy. Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract, a contract on GSA 8(a) STARS, or a contract on GSA VETS GWAC.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) (www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/clinresearch) supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents. This includes basic, clinical, and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics that are funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.</p>
<p>The evaluation of new and improved vaccine, diagnostics and therapeutic candidates in clinical trials and clinical studies is an essential element of the efforts of the NIAID. One key NIAID program that has been carrying out these studies since the 1960's is the Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEU). Approximately 40 clinical trials and clinical studies have been conducted during the past three years under current contracts. (HHSN272200800002C, HHSN272200800003C, HHSN272200800004C, HHSN272200800005C, HHSN272200800006C, HHSN272200800007C, HHSN272200800008C, and HHSN272200800057C; all due to expire on or about October 31, 2014.) Several of these clinical trials/studies were performed in a compressed time frame to address emergent public health research needs, for example the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The purpose of the proposed solicitation is to provide for the recompetition of the VTEU, to continue designing and conducting a broad range of clinical studies and clinical trials of bacterial, viral and parasitic vaccines, therapeutics, and other biologics and drugs as preventive and therapeutic measures against infectious diseases in people of all ages and risk categories. These studies have and will continue to include IDE, IND and non-IND trials, many Phase I first in man clinical trials, and Phase II proof-of-concept trials. The VTEUs have and will continue to undertake a variety of other studies, which include targeted surveillance for pathogens of interest in study populations; evaluations of novel investigational product delivery systems; and reevaluation of current vaccine formulations, schedules and modes of delivery.</p>
<p>In addition to conducting clinical trials, the VTEUs are responsible for identifying new concepts for clinical trials. These concepts have and will continue to include new methods to utilize currently available vaccine, diagnostics, and treatments; clinical trials of promising investigational products; and clinical studies conducted to better characterize responses to vaccines. The VTEUs work with DMID protocol teams and other collaborators to develop concepts, proposed by the VTEUs or other sources, into clinical protocols. The VTEUs also provide expert consultation to DMID in areas of infectious disease clinical research. Finally, the VTEUs have an important role in responding to emerging public health needs at the direction of the NIAID.<br /><br />The objective of the VTEUs is to support the conduct of clinical studies and clinical trials related to infectious diseases in a variety of domestic and international populations. Examples of studies that will be conducted include Phase 0 through Phase IV clinical trials, clinical trials for devices and diagnostics, clinical studies, sample collection, sample analysis, surveillance, and epidemiology studies. In addition and in order to carry out clinical studies and clinical trials spanning as wide a variety of infectious diseases as possible, the VTEUs will be required to have the ability to conduct studies in international populations. To this end, for any contract awards made the contractor(s) MUST document and have the ability to access at least 200 subjects per year from an international population in a resource poor setting (low and middle income countries as defined by the World Bank (see: http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups) that includes healthy volunteers from birth to mature adults, pregnant women and subjects with endemic diseases for the specific international location.</p>
<p>The NIAID anticipates awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts to organizations that meet the overall qualifications needed to fulfill the technical requirements of the proposed solicitation. Task orders for specific tasks will be issued after the award of the IDIQ contract. All projects carried out under this contract must be conducted in a manner consistent with all applicable Federal regulations and the DMID, NIAID, NIH and DHHS policies and guidelines for the conduct and oversight of research involving human subjects. The anticipated start date is on/or about September 13, 2013 with an ordering period of seven years.</p>

<SUBJECT>Request For Information: Development and Implementation of a single authoritative import injury questionaire data source
<SOLNBR>ITC-RFI-12-0001
<RESPDATE>050712

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Project Title</strong>: Development and implementation of a single authoritative import injury questionnaire data source.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Purpose</strong></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather information from industry to improve the U.S. International Trade Commission's (USITC) understanding of market capabilities, and to identify potential small business vendors capable of providing support and consulting services. It is issued solely for market research and planning purposes. It does not constitute a request for proposal or a commitment to issue a request for proposal. The USITC is not responsible for any administrative cost incurred by a vendor in response to this announcement.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">The USITC is interested in services to develop a cost-efficient electronic questionnaire data (see link 1 below for current template questionnaires) management and reporting system for import injury questionnaire data that ensures data integrity, provides real-time data, and allows for multiple input and user facilities. The USITC envisions a single authoritative system to manage questionnaire information that seamlessly integrates technology and work processes to support the investigative work of Commission managers and staff. The information provided in response to this RFI will broaden the USITC's knowledge base, allowing it to assess the availability of commercial data management software and business consulting services and assess the tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed with the project with the ultimate goal of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of its import injury work process.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Introduction and Background</strong></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">The USITC's mission is to: (1) administer U.S. trade remedy laws within its mandate in a fair and objective manner; (2) provide the President, the United States Trade Representative (USTR), and Congress with independent, quality analysis, information, and support on matters relating to tariffs and international trade and competitiveness; and (3) maintain the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. As part of the USITC's mission, the Commission conducts antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) investigations under title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930. In AD/CVD investigations, the Commission determines whether an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury, or whether the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports of the merchandise that are under investigation. The Commission develops an extensive record during these proceedings, including a substantial amount of confidential business information from questionnaires issued to U.S. producers, foreign producers, U.S. importers, and U.S. purchasers, and also develops a staff report (see link 2 below for example of Commission staff report). To expedite the investigative process, the Commission has developed generic questionnaires that are modified for each investigation to reflect the investigation- and industry-specific requirements. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The USITC is located at 500 E Street SW, Washington, DC 20436.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Objectives </strong></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-INDENT: 0.25in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">The overall objective of this effort is to implement a single authoritative source for quantitative trade, financial, and pricing data that allow automated extraction by all members of the investigative team. The specific objectives of this effort are:</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo3"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Reduction of manual data entry</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo3"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Reduction in the time and resources needed between data collection, entry, validation, updating, analysis, and presentation</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo3"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Improvement in the ease of creation, modification, and updating of data tables and data download</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo3"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>A team-oriented exchange of data while maintaining real-time data access and overall data integrity.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">This process is taking place in an IT environment that is transitioning from one that has been driven by individual Office needs into a more unified and simplified IT environment that greatly reflects broader Agency needs. MS Office products are part of all user software profiles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Staff on AD/CVD investigations currently uses multiple individually developed database and analysis tools, with a variety of approaches to organizing and storing data. The current process by which data moves from questionnaire respondents to final staff reports involves several stages, is characterized by overlapping areas of responsibility and use, is continuously updated and augmented, and requires substantial direct involvement from investigative, statistical, and support staff (see attachment). Best practices and recommendations must allow for the USITC's focused, but gradual transition in technology, process, and culture.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Considerations</strong></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">The following should be considered when assessing and recommending applications and solutions:</p>

<DESC>Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Radiation Portal Monitoring System
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP or Broad Area Announcement (BAA). Furthermore, those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback with regards to its submission; other than acknowledgment of receipt - IF a request for an acknowledgement is requested by the submitter. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. DHS DNDO Product Acquisition and Deployment Directorate (PADD) is not seeking proposals at this time. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or BAA. If a solicitation is released, it will be via the Government-wide Port of Entry (GPE) at (http://www.fedbizopps.gov). It is the responsibility of the potential responders to monitor the website for any information that may pertain to this RFI. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p><br />1.0 Description<br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is conducting targeted market research to determine available sources for a current, state-of-the-art, radiation portal monitor system. The information provided in response to this RFI will support acquisition decisions for the Radiation Portal Monitor Program within DNDO.</p>
<p>2.0 Objective<br />The DNDO is taking a commercial-first approach in seeking commercially available solutions to fill the needs of DHS Components in the area of radiation/nuclear (rad/nuc) detection. Specifically, this RFI seeks technical information on commercially available Radiation Portal Monitoring Systems that can detect radiological/nuclear threats in conveyances that transition through land and sea ports of entry (POEs.) and could supplement or supplant current deployed fixed radiation panel monitors (RPM) detection systems. The vendors who submit information will also need to demonstrate readiness to participate in a government COTS Performance Characterization Test (i.e., evidence that key system capabilities have been tested at the system-level in a relevant operational environment.). Vendors are requested to respond to this notice if they are interested in providing this type of product.</p>
<p>3.0 Information Sought<br />This RFI seeks commercial sources of RPMs for immediate deployment at land and sea ports of entry that use technologies other than helium-3 for neutron detection. Information solicited by the Government in this RFI will assist the Government in identifying the sources and solutions that are available (as is) in the market place or are available in the market place with (minor) modifications that exhibit the minimum set of operational capabilities. The responder must offer information for a commercially available solution that is at technology readiness level (TRL) of 9 (i.e., actual system completed and "operationally qualified" through test and field demonstration) and a manufacturing readiness level (MRL) of 9 (i.e., manufacturing process in place for full rate production).</p>
<p>Specifically, this RFI seeks information on relevant technologies, capabilities, and concepts in the following deployment vectors:<br />&bull; Land border crossings (i.e., car and truck traffic)<br />&bull; Seaport terminals (i.e., truck traffic moving sea containers)<br />&bull; Mail and Express Consignment Courier Facilities (i.e., could be a single panel configuration)<br />&bull; Air Cargo Terminals (i.e., air cargo containers)</p>
<p>From the standpoint of radionuclide and associated activity levels of interest, Table 4 in ANSI 42.35-2006 (American National Standard for Evaluation of Radiation Detection Portal Monitors in Use in Homeland Security) provides an initial starting point of interest.<br />Please note this RFI is not interested in a System Integrator, or a company that has no technology or system design available.</p>
<p>Responders can refer to the instructions below for specific information requested.</p>
<p>4.0 Submission Requirements</p>
<p>4.1 General Submission Requirements<br />Responders should adhere to these instructions for responses. In general, formatting should include Times New Roman 12 point font, single spaced, 8.5 x 11 inch paper, with 1-inch margins.

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers Fort Worth District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) for large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) for the following project: <br><br>Design-Build VOLAR Barracks Renovations and Site Drainage Improvements, Fort Polk, LA<br><br>Project Description includes the design and phased renovation of 10 VOLAR barracks at Fort Polk, Louisiana, to improve energy efficiency, eliminate mold and mildew, and provide a better living environment for the soldiers that will last for the next 20 years. Work will include design and renovation of 10 barracks to house one soldier per room; replacement of water and sewer service lines to each barracks; site and site drainage improvements; landscaping; LEED Silver certification for each barracks.  The design and construction will be performed in 3 phases.  Phase 1 will include all design, site drainage improvements, and renovation of 2 barracks.  Phase 2 will include renovation of 4 barracks, and Phase 3 will include renovation of 4 barracks.  <br><br>Range of Magnitude:  Between $100,000,000.00 and $250,000,000.00.<br><br>Period of Performance:   1330 calendar days after Notice to Proceed. <br><br>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:<br><br>  a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<br>b. The complexity of the project.<br>  c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br>  d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br>  e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area.<br>  f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br>  g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br>  h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.<br><br>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). <br><br>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: <br><br>  a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. <br><br>  b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will<br><br>     1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and <br><br>    2. Be consistent with law.<br><br>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<br><br>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:<br><br>  a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the Fort Worth District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?<br><br>  b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?<br><br>  c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability?  Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?<br><br>  d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters?

<DESC>Mission and Installation Contracting Command - Installation Contracting Office (MICC-ICO), Fort Campbell, KY, has a requirement for two (2) Trimble R8 Model Radios and Associated Accessories. The Government intends to enter into a firm-fixed-price contract with Precision Products, 1311 Elm Hill Pike, Nashville, TN 37210.  The procurement will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) which states,  "For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name or industrial mobilization)."  The basis for restricting competition is that Precision Products is the only authorized dealer for the Kentucky/Tennessee area for Trimble Products and has the ability to provide installation as well.   Due to proprietary rights, only authorized dealers and the manufacture are authorized to provide required products/installation.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (Committee) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL, a Committee-authorized nonprofit agency becomes the mandatory source for procurement of the product when the Government has a requirement for the product.  When products are determined to be essentially-the same- as the product being added to the PL, they are not authorized for purchase by Government employees as well.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following products to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		6230-00-NIB-0032<br />Name:		Safety Flare, Programmable Flicker Pattern, Red LED, 8in Diameter, AA Battery <br /> Operated<br />Description:	8in diameter single unit alkaline battery operated, waterproof, rechargeable, non-incendiary safety light flare featuring red LED. Multiple flash patterns, including proprietary omni-directional "Fire Flicker" pattern that simulates incendiary road flares. Features commercial-grade design to withstand weight of industrial/ military vehicles and constructed with tread-lock cleats for traction. Replacement for incendiary road flares. Flare dimension: 8 inch diameter, 2.5 inches high. Five AA batteries required. Batteries are included. UoI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		6230-00-NIB-0033	<br />Name:		Kit, Safety Flare, Programmable Flicker Pattern, Red LED, 8in Diameter, <br />AA Battery Operated<br />Description: 	8in diameter safety flare alkaline battery kit. Kit includes eight (8) waterproof, single unit alkaline battery operated, rechargeable, non-incendiary safety light flares featuring red LED and heavy duty plastic storage case. Multiple flash patterns, including proprietary omni-directional "Fire Flicker" pattern that simulates incendiary road flares. Kit includes five (5) "AA" alkaline batteries per flare. Features commercial-grade design to withstand weight of industrial/ military vehicles and constructed with tread-lock cleats for traction. Flare dimension: 8 inch diameter, 2.5 inches high. Storage case measures 14" x 14" x10". Replacement for incendiary road flares. Batteries are included for each flare. UOI is KT. KT = 8 flares.</p>
<p>NSN:		6230-00-NIB-0034<br />Name:		Kit, Safety Flare, Programmable Flicker Pattern, Red LED, 8in Diameter, 				Rechargeable Power Unit<br />Description:    	8in diameter safety flare rechargeable battery kit. Kit includes eight (8) waterproof, rechargeable, single-unit non-incendiary safety light flares featuring red LED. Multiple flash patterns, including proprietary omni-directional "Fire Flicker" pattern that simulates incendiary road flares. Kit includes AC power cord, DC power cord, AC charger, car charger, and plastic formfitting impact resistant smart charger case that also acts as the recharging base. Features commercial-grade design to withstand weight of industrial/ military vehicles and constructed with tread-lock cleats for traction. Flare dimension: 8 inch diameter, 2.5 inches high. Storage case measures 14" x 14" x 10" Replacement for incendiary road flares. Batteries are included for each flare. UOI is KT. KT = 8 flares</p>
<p>Should these products be added to the PL, the contracting activity will be the Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support, Construction &amp; Equipment, Philadelphia, PA.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact on commercial firms who are providing the products, or those products determined to be essentially-the-same products being added to the PL, to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on a firm's revenues and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such revenues from the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL are offset by any potential adverse impact on the commercial firm(s).</p>
<p>For the products being considered for addition to the PL in this Notice, no other products have been determined to be essentially-the-same as those products. This means that only the sales of firms selling identically the same products as those listed in this Notice may be effected should the Committee approve the addition of the products to the Procurement List.  Pictures of the products listed above are provided as attachments to this Notice.</p>
<p><br />In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected MAS/BPA vendors, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by selling the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 29, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  By providing this information, you are helping to ensure that the Committee can complete an accurate impact analysis.</p>
<p>If the information is not received by the date requested, the Committee may conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC><p>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine, Center of Information to negotiate with Corman Technologies for the brand name Enterprise Application Monitor (EAM) software and support. More information is listed below.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to acquire a license for the brand name Enterprise Application Monitor (EAM) software and support from Corman Technologies, 1060A Fourth Street, Santa Rosa, California 95404 for a Base Period of 04-16-12 through 04-15-13, with four (4) successive 12-month Option Periods. <br />Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:</p>
<p>Part of DECA's current responsibilities is to provide expert support to the NIH Clinical Center in the acquisition of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software tool (including support) to monitor a user's experience of the Clinical Research Information System (CRIS). Part of a user's experience with this enterprise system includes items such as the timing to open patient list and the individual tabs to view specific data once a patient is selected from the list.</p>
<p>The NIH Clinical Center includes the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center (CRC) which is the on-site hospital for the NIH campus, providing full support for clinical research in inpatient and outpatient settings. The CRC facility is comprised of clinical, laboratory, and administrative space with 242 inpatient beds and 90 day-hospital stations.</p>
<p>The NIH Clinical Center's Department of Clinical Research Informatics (DCRI) manages and supports CRIS. CRIS is a Windows SQL-based hospital information system, Allscripts (Eclipsys) Sunrise Acute Care (version 5.5 sp1), which includes provider order entry, result retrieval, and clinical documentation for all NIH inpatient and outpatient visits. CRIS is a group of comprehensive modules that support clinical care and the collection of research data for the intramural clinical research programs of the NIH. This enterprise system also includes the Allscripts Sunrise Medication Management module, plus the Allscripts Enterprise Scheduling module and Allscripts Patient Portal, which are both currently being implemented.</p>
<p>The Clinical Center utilizes Allscripts (Eclipsys) Sunrise software as the core application for CRIS. The continuous operation and performance of CRIS is critical to patient care. The system is based on Microsoft SQL server technology and has multiple databases and interfaces that must be operational 24x7.<br /><br />The Clinical Center has a requirement to monitor CRIS at the component level. Most COTS monitoring tools look at the physical components such as CPU usage, memory, I/O, storage, and network connectivity. While these items are important, they fail to get to the root cause of the problem or monitor what the end user experiences. Allscripts, the manufacture of the hospital information system (HIS), does not offer any tools to allow the customers to monitor the system to this level. Allscripts only provides monitoring services as an option to its customers that focuses on the back end of the system, such as database, services and connectivity.</p>
<p>The performance of the components within CRIS, including the system monitoring tool, is vital to its operation.<br />Nature of the Acquisition and Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications:</p>
<p>The necessary software monitoring tool (and support) for CRIS must provide the combination of all the following functionalities:</p>

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Sole Source for a Feasibility Study to Supply Steam and Electricity to Norfolk Naval Shipyard
<SOLNBR>N6247012R5006
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:maureen.hoesly@navy.mil">maureen.hoesly@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Atlantic intends to award a sole-source, firm-fixed price (FFP) contract to Navigant Consulting, Inc., 30 S. Wacker Drive, Suite 3550, Chicago, Illinois, 60606-7481. 

The award will be made under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source exists and it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. This requirement is considered a logical follow on to Task Order 0046 under the expired contract N62470-06-D-7201.

 The period of performance will be for one year. The rationale that only one responsible source (Navigant) exists is based on: Navigants specialized expertise in the area of steam energy analysis; Navigants specific experience with the NNSY energy requirements and pertinent steam system alternatives gained through previous analyses performed pursuant to the 2000 NNSY Energy Vision and Task Order 0046 under Contract N62470-06-D-7201; and, the services sought in this contracting action are based upon and a continuation of the prior analyses.
 Navigant created the original energy vision analysis of the steam node concept and employs the personnel uniquely familiar with its development.  Also, under Task Order 0046 (Contract N62470-06-D-7201), Navigant completed data collection tasks now needed to support the new requirements.  This data includes information on base energy loads, consumption patterns, and building information.  Correct application and interpretation of the data is foundational for analyzing new opportunities to increase steam consumption, to formulate information necessary for negotiations with Wheelabrator, and to quickly and efficiently update the Energy Vision analysis of the steam node concept.

Any other contracted source will have to collect this body of information and develop the analyses already performed.
  This is because Navigants data collection method and processes are arguably proprietary, and because any other contracted source would not rely on Navigants analysis and recommendations without an independent data collection and review.  In addition, the Government will have to facilitate any new contractors collection of data and then review and comment on the new contractors analysis to ensure its quality.

The North American Industrial Code System (NAICS) code is 541618 with a size standard of $14 million in average annual receipts. Interested parties must submit their capability statements in writing within 15 days of the date this notice is posted. Written responses can be emailed to maureen.hoesly@navy.mil.
 Telephone calls will not be accepted. Any responses received after the 15 day submission period will not be considered. Responses will be used solely to determine whether a competitive solicitation should be issued and will not be the basis for an award. A determination not to compete this action based upon responses received is at the sole discretion of the Government.

 Application software will be transferred to a MARCORSYSCOM server. PMTRASYS user licenses on the TECOM server will be transferred to MARCORSYSCOM.   It is the Government's belief that only one source is capable to meet the requirements, and no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirement. 

All questions, concerns, and information should be addressed to Fred Boehne at fred.j.boehne@usmc.mil or mailed to Fred Boehne at the contracting office address listed below. No phone calls will be accepted. 

Contracting Office Address:

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items<br />EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable best value source selection. Award will be made to the lowest evaluated price offeror that is determined to have a technically acceptable proposal and receives an acceptable past performance rating. <br />The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. The Government will evaluate the technical proposals and assign ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable.</p>
<p>(1) The offeror's proposal shall, at a minimum, address each of the sub factors in (3) below, as they apply to the PWS. Detailed instructions are included in the proposal preparation instructions section of this solicitation. During evaluation of each proposal, the Government<br />will assign each sub factor a rating as shown in table (2) below. A rating of unacceptable in one or more technical sub factors will constitute an overall rating of unacceptable for the technical evaluation and may result in the entire proposal being eliminated from the competition.</p>
<p>(2) The ratings consist of:</p>
<p>TECHNICAL ACCEPTABLE/UNACCEPTABLE RATINGS</p>
<p>RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Acceptable: Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Unacceptable: Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>(3) Description of Sub factors:</p>
<p>(a) Sub factor: Long Term Lodging</p>
<p>Description of Sub factor: Contractor is required to provide sufficient documentation that clearly demonstrates the ability to provide Long Term Lodging facilities IAW the PWS.</p>
<p>(b) Sub factor: Transportation</p>
<p>Description of Sub factor: Contractor is required to provide organization's approach to meeting all student transportation requirement IAW the PWS.</p>
<p>(c) Sub factor: Proximity to leisure activities Submit a description of amenities within shuttle distance provide by your facility i.e. dinning, malls and recreational facilities.</p>
<p><br />Description of Sub factor: Contractor is required to Submit a description of amenities within shuttle distance provided by your facility i.e. dinning, malls and recreational facilities.</p>
<p>B. Price Evaluation. The Government will evaluate the price proposals, and any other relevant proposal data submitted, to determine if proposed prices are reasonable and balanced based on the offeror (s) proposed approach. Price will contribute substantially to the source selection decision, and the source selection will be conducted with the expectation of adequate price competition per FAR 15.403-1(c)(1), therefore, cost or pricing data are not required. However, the offeror may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the Contracting Officer to determine price reasonableness.</p>
<p>(1) For the purposes of the initial price evaluation, the offeror shall submit Description of Services CLINS 0001 and 0002. Any other information provided by the offeror will not be considered or evaluated. All proposals will be evaluated for reasonableness. A Total<br />Evaluated Price (TEP) will be presented to the Source Selection Authority (SSA) for award decision purposes. The offeror's TEP will be calculated as the sum of the Firm-Fixed-Price CLINs 0001-0002. The Government may use any of the following price analysis techniques IAW FAR 15.404-1(b): comparison of proposed prices received, comparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government and commercial prices, use of parametric estimating/rough yardsticks, comparison with competitive published price list or market prices, comparison with independent Government cost estimates, comparison with market research, and analysis of pricing information provided by the offeror. If the price analysis techniques are<br />insufficient to make a determination of price reasonableness, the contracting officer may request information other than cost or pricing data in order to make a determination of price reasonableness.</p>
<p>(2) To the extent necessary, the Contracting Officer may use other proposal analysis techniques, such as technical analysis and cost analysis to determine price reasonableness. In addition, proposed unit prices will be evaluated for unbalanced pricing (FAR 15.404-1(g)). Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items or sub line item appears to be significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of price analysis techniques. An offeror's proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to<br />the Government. Also a contract will not be awarded to an offeror whose price is not determined reasonable.<br /><br />C. Past Performance Evaluation. The Government will evaluate past performance to assess how well the offeror performed work relevant to the type of effort and type of requirement described in the solicitation as an indicator of an offeror's ability to perform the contract successfully. The past performance evaluation results is an assessment of the offeror's probability of meeting the minimum past performance solicitation requirements. This assessment is based on the offeror's record of relevant and recent past performance information that pertains to the services outlined in the solicitation requirements. There are two aspects to the past performance evaluation. The first is to evaluate whether the offeror's present/past performance is relevant or not relevant to the effort to be acquired. The second aspect of the past performance evaluation is to determine how well the contractor performed on the contracts. The past performance evaluation performed in support of a current source selection does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror's past performance on past contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well the offeror performed those past contracts.</p>
<p>The Government will use the following procedures in evaluating past<br />performance:</p>
<p>(1) Recency is defined as performance occurring within the last three (3) years of the date of this solicitation, except that ongoing programs must have begun no less than three (3) months from issuance of the RFP.</p>
<p>(2) The Government will evaluate the relevancy of offeror's past performance and assign ratings of Relevant, or Not Relevant:</p>
<p>PAST PERFROMANCE RELEVANCY DESCRIPTIONS</p>
<p>RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of<br />effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and<br />magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p><br />(3) The Government will determine how well the contractor performed on past contracts and assign ratings of Acceptable, or Unacceptable:</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION RATINGS</p>
<p>RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Acceptable</p>
<p>Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below)</p>
<p>Unacceptable</p>
<p>Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to<br />have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability,"unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>(4) Sources of past performance information for evaluation is as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Offeror's shall submit past performance information on at least one (1) but no more than three (3) recent contracts during the past three (3) years from RFP date that you consider most relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform the proposed effort. Include rationale supporting your assertion of relevance. Complete and submit information required in the Addendum to 52.212- 1 of the RFP "Past Performance Information," for each of these contracts.</p>
<p>(b) Past performance information shall be obtained from any other sources available to the Government to include, but not limited to, PPIRS or other databases; interviews with Program Managers, Contracting Officers, and Fee-Determining Officials; and the Defense Contract Management Agency. The past performance evaluation team will review this past performance<br />information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to the requirements of this solicitation. See FAR 15.101-2(b)(1) for treatment of past performance relative to small business. Failure to receive an acceptable past performance rating may result in the entire proposal being eliminated from the competition.</p>
<p>D. After initial evaluation of each offeror's technical and price proposals, and assessment of each offeror's past performance, if the lowest reasonably priced technically acceptable offer (by TEP) is determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104, and has an acceptable past<br />performance assessment rating, award will be made to that offeror without entering into discussions as this represents the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>E. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. Offerors shall submit sufficient information and in the format specified in Proposal Preparation Instructions in the Addendum to 52.212-1. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (e.g.,the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past<br />performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Exchanges conducted with regard to adverse past performance or to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions, and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a<br />contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>F. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. If the Government elects to hold discussions, a competitive range may be established based on FAR 15.306(c) procedures and this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to further limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. If the contracting officer determines that an offeror's proposal should no longer be included in the competitive range, the proposal will be eliminated from consideration for award. Written notice of this decision shall be provided to unsuccessful offerors in accordance with FAR 15.503. Offerors excluded or otherwise eliminated from the competitive range may request a debriefing in accordance with FAR 15.505 or 15.506.</p>
<p>G. After conclusion of discussions and receipt of final proposal revisions, the Government will make an award to the lowest reasonably priced technically acceptable offer (by TEP) that is determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104, and has an acceptable performance assessment rating, as this represents the best value to the Government.<br />(End of provision) <br /><br />FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items. Offerors are reminded that Representations and Certifications are maintained at the following website: http://orca.bpn.gov/publicserach.aspx.

The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, the Foreign Affairs Handbook (FAH), the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.</p>
<p>E. COMPLEXITY<br />The programs implemented by INL are generally highly complex multi-year development and capacity-building programs. The programs often require the ability to resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.</p>
<p>Programs are also characterized by large obligations of USG funds, a potentially high-risk security environment, a geographically broad operating platform, demanding program schedules, frequently changing requirements, politically sensitive outcomes, multiple interagency and international actors, multiple contractor and sub-contractor relationships, and intense audit/oversight scrutiny. Detailed plans, goals, objectives, and evaluation criteria are required for the long-range implementation and administration of the programs. Decisions concerning planning and organizing the programs are complicated by the intricacy of the contracts and the need to deal with multilayered concepts. Problems can arise that require intuition - the ability to tell when something is wrong or is likely to go wrong; inductive reasoning - the ability to combine pieces of information to form general rules or conclusions (includes finding a relationship among seemingly unrelated events); and deductive reasoning - the ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense.</p>
<p>F. PHYSICAL DEMANDS<br />The work requires the ability to travel to and from several remote areas. The work requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Successful completion of a State Department Class 1 unrestricted medical exam is required. Extended assignments to remote program sites will be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the work difficult and may not be capable of passing the State Department required medical exam.</p>
<p>G. SUPERVISORY CONTROLS <br />The COR carries out duties on behalf of the CO but reports to the INL Director at Post. The GTM is delegated authority by the CO to assist the COR. The incumbent's actions, decisions, and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of demonstrated professional judgment, results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.</p>
<p>H. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE.<br />The period of performance will be one year from the date of award with four option years.</p>
<p>III. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS<br />A. U.S. citizen, holding at least an actual or interim State Department Top Secret security clearance.</p>
<p>B. A Bachelor's Degree in architecture, construction science, construction management, or engineering; preferably structural or civil engineering preferred. Master's degree is preferred.</p>
<p>C. A total of fifteen years' professional work experience, of which: <br />1) Two years shall have included managing projects of similar scale, scope, and complexity as described in paragraph II.E above. <br />2) One year shall be equivalent to the GS-13 level in the federal service. <br />3) Overall, experience should demonstrate to the maximum extent possible:<br />i.

<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>I. BACKGROUND, ORGANIZATION AND PURPOSE<br />A. BACKGROUND. <br />The mission of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is to minimize the impact of international crime and illegal drugs on the United States and its citizens through providing effective foreign assistance and fostering global cooperation. INL is responsible for developing policies and managing programs to strengthen law enforcement and other rule of law institutional capabilities outside the United States. INL relies on contractors to assist in fulfilling its responsibilities. Because these programs require resources well beyond those organic to INL, INL has three indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts under which it provides the services of experienced law enforcement, judicial, corrections and counternarcotics advisors to provide support to host nation civilian law enforcement and rule of law programs overseas; provide pre-deployment and in-country support for advisors; and perform other related functions.</p>
<p>INL currently administers about fourteen task orders issued under its IDIQ contracts in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo, the West Bank, Haiti, Sudan, Lebanon and Liberia. The task orders range in value from $10M to approximately $1B. The task orders include both fixed labor rate and cost reimbursement contract line items (CLINs).</p>
<p>B. ORGANIZATION. <br />The IDIQ contracts are administered by the U.S. Department of State (DOS) contracting officer (CO) in Rosslyn, VA. Organizationally, the CO for these contracts resides within the DOS Office of Acquisitions Management (A/LM/AQM).The CO designates a contracting officer's representative (COR) and government technical monitors (GTM) from INL to deploy overseas to the location of contractor performance and serve as the "eyes and ears" of the CO. The COR reports contract issues directly to the CO. The GTM assists the COR. All personnel deployed on INL missions are assigned to and report operationally and administratively to the INL Director at post. The programs at post are supported by INL Headquarters in Washington, DC. Of note, Program Offices support respective field operations in various regions of the globe in terms of program policy, budget formulation, strategic guidance and monitoring and evaluation. The Program Offices are: <br />&bull; The Office of Iraq Programs (INL/I); <br />&bull; The Office of Western Hemisphere Programs (INL/WHP); <br />&bull; The Office of Afghanistan/Pakistan Programs (INL/AP); <br />&bull; The Office of Europe and Asia Programs (INL/EA); and <br />&bull; The Office of Africa and Middle East Programs (INL/AME.) <br />Within INL's Office of Resource Management (INL/RM), the Contract Administrative Support Division (INL/RM/CAS), maintains liaison and coordination with contract oversight personnel by providing guidance on contract administrative policies, procedures, training and other support. CAS functions are carried out in strict coordination with the Acquisitions and Grants Support division (INL/RM/AGS.)</p>
<p>C. PURPOSE. <br />The purpose of this statement of work is for INL to obtain the services of a Contract Administration Advisor to deploy anywhere worldwide and assist with administering one or more IDIQ task orders in a country. As such, duties will include functioning as a COR or GTM.</p>

<DESC>Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 3 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received.  However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.   

PLEASE NOTE:  ALL RESPONSES SHALL BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY AS EOFFERS

  Contact Dennis Bilger who can be reached at 215-697-9626 or email dennis.bilger@navy.mil.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  
 
FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement.  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award will be based on a combination of factors - a combination of price and past performance.  The relative importance of the factors is as follows [past performance is more important than price.] 

The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms.
 Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.
  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoters past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.
  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ. The Government reserves the right to award the contract to other than the lowest priced quoter.

Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/ . 

All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>Coast Guard Acquisition Procedures (CGAP)<br />APPENDIX C - CHAPTER 3033 <br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS </strong>- United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />Proposal Submission Place:<br />Mr. Sergii Shevchenko<br />Director<br />SVIT-M Ltd.<br />36 Prokofyeva Street<br />Sumy, 40030<br />Ukraine</p>
<p>Phone: +38-0675401160<br />Fax: +38-0542635823<br />Email: <a href="mailto:alex.s.shev@gmail.com">alex.s.shev@gmail.com<br /><br /></a>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a waste recycling and refuse derived fuel plant in Sumy, Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Grantee, SVIT-M, Ltd., was originally founded in 2002 with the purpose of providing the City of Sumy with services related to the transporting and reprocessing of solid domestic, non-radioactive, and non-toxic industrial waste. The City of Sumy signed a ten-year tender agreement with SVIT-M in September 2006 to provide these services. The terms of agreement include the requirement to build a Municipal Waste Processing (MSW) and Processed Engineered Fuel (PEF, also known as Refuse Derived Fuel) production plant.</p>
<p>As such, the Grantee plans to build and operate a MSW processing (sorting and recycling), PEF manufacturing plant and transfer station at an existing site in the City of Sumy in Ukraine. MSW collected by the collection contractors will be delivered to the Project site and sorted to separate glass, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and a potion of plastics, paper and cardboard for recycling. The remaining combustible materials, after removing inert and non-combustible material, is dried, compressed and pelletized or briquetted for use as fuel in the boiler houses of Sumska Oblast . An oblast is a type of administrative division in Ukraine, similar to a zone or province. The non-combustible material or tramps (e.g., any non-recyclable glass, and metals, food scraps, construction waste such as drywall, etc.) will be transferred to a recently opened landfill for disposal. The proposed project will also be used as a transfer station where MSW received in smaller trucks could be combined and reloaded into larger trucks and delivered to the new landfill 45 kilometers (km) from the city. The project site is only about 7 km from the center of the city, and the use of the transfer station is expected to result in transportation fuel cost savings.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to assess the technical, economic, and financing viability of the proposed project.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $350,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) and in direct payments of cash contributions from the Grantee in the amount of $106,875. The total contract amount will be fixed at $456,875.</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a><br /><br />Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP. The Grantee's cash contributions are not subject to USTDA's nationality provisions.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4:00 PM, May 14, 2012</span></strong>, at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Worldwide</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>The Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI's Operations and Management Division (OMD) in Washington provides OTI with an advanced level of operational and management support to help ensure ongoing and improved flexible, rapid response in political transition programming overseas. OTI/OMD is responsible for instituting and maintaining office-wide systems and processes, office practices and procedures, and the creation of an enhanced response capability through teamwork, responsiveness, fiscal responsibility, quality control, and customer service.</p>
<p>Within OMD, the Information and Technology (IT) Team is responsible for analyzing needs, developing solutions, and advising on issues related to business process and information management in direct support of OTI's numerous field programs. The IT team regularly participates in core DCHA/OTI process design, development and training exercises. The goal of the IT team is to create and maintain an enhanced response capability to support information management and effective processes for OTI field and Washington teams. The team accomplishes this through analyzing business process and information management needs in order to institute and maintain office-wide systems, processes, practices and procedures that support the overall mission of the office as well as address the needs of individual teams.</p>
<p>Program and operations staff in OTI work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to hire an Information and Technology (IT) Advisor within OTI's Operations and Management Division (OMD). The IT Advisor will provide administrative support for program funded U.S. Personal Services Contract (USPSC) employees and program operations in OTI. The OTI IT Advisor will be supervised by the Chief, Operations Management Division or his/her designee, and will also work under the general guidance and direction of the relevant OTI Team Leader for specific assignments.</p>
<p>This is a key position in an exciting and busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations overseas. For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support. The IT Advisor will provide ad hoc support and advice on IT matters and has the ability to maintain flexibility in a fast-paced dynamic environment while managing competing priorities and meeting aggressive deadlines. Providing knowledgeable, rapid response using standard operating procedures and making recommendations for improvements or innovations to increase effectiveness and efficiency is critical to successful implementation of OTI's programs and fulfillment of OTI's mandate.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire an Information and Technology (IT) Advisor within OTI's Operations and Management Division (OMD).</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Information and Technology Advisor requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the OTI Information and Technology Advisor requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The OTI Information and Technology Advisor is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The OTI Information and Technology Advisor is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The OTI Information and Technology Advisor has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. OTI Information and Technology Advisor is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>The IT Advisor is responsible for assisting in management of OTI's information and technology resources, and providing information, technology and communications support services for OTI program implementation staff. The IT Advisor is a member of OTI's Operations and Management Division's IT Team. Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI IT Team Leader or his or her designee, the IT Advisor will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull; Monitor and understand agency IT and Information Security systems, requirements and policies, especially as they affect OTI and implementing partner staff in the field. Analyze OTI business processes and work products in order to seamlessly integrate OTI's systems into agency systems, while also reducing redundancies in OTI systems whenever additions and/or changes occur in agency systems.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the IT Team in providing scheduled and ad hoc training for Washington and field-based staff on use of standard OTI information technology equipment and systems with a special focus on OTI-established web-based applications.</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of the OTI mandate, such as backstopping the IT Team members.</p>
<p>&bull; Travel overseas in fulfillment of duties as required.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide recommendations on OTI business system improvements or additions using current web technologies and techniques through the development, maintenance, and support of OTI's information management systems across all OTI field programs worldwide.</p>
<p>&bull; When required, perform some systems administration work primarily with regards to managing webservers and databases running on the Linux platform. Assist the IT Team in designing and maintaining product release and backup procedures.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective January 23, 2012 electronically. IMPORTANT: CURRENT SCHEDULE 084 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NOTICE: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES: Please review the solicitation document for clause changes. Please note that effective January 1, 2005, all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must have their Offeror Representations and Certifications updated in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website. The ORCA website can be accessed http://www.bpn.orga.gov. Please note that any offer submitted after February 22, 2012 MUST be submitted on the Solicitation dated January 23, 2012 (Refresh #18) and must be submitted through the eOffer system. Offers received after February 22, 2012 that are submitted on prior versions will not be accepted. Effective December 10, 2010, firearm lubricants added by modification to current contracts or awarded under new contracts for Special Item Number (SIN) 426-4G, Firearms Storage, Securing and Cleaning Equipment; Unloading Stations; Bullet Recovery Systems and Gun Racks must meet the Bio-preferred standard. Executive Order 13514 (http://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/eo13514/]) requires that 95% of all new contract actions are designated for green products and/or services through certification guidelines established by governmental agencies. In order to begin implementation of that order, GSA has designated that one SIN on Schedule 84 will require green certification. For SIN 426-4G (Attachment 5), firearm lubricants must be certified as Biopreferred by obtaining certification from the U. S. Department of Agriculture at www.biopreferred.gov. The offeror must make an affirmative statement that the products offered are compliant with the applicable standard and the products are listed on the USDA website. If not listed, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to ask for copies of the certification. This refresh includes the addition of five (5) new SINs for Ancillary Supplies and/or Services: 260-1000, 465-1000, 633-1000, 246-1000, and 426-1000. These SINs may only be offered in conjunction with the offer of a corresponding product SIN. Effective with this refresh (18), offers longer accepted under SIN 246-50; services previously covered under SIN 246-50 are now covered under new SIN 246-1000. Effective with this refresh (18), offers longer accepted under SIN 260-98; services previously covered under SIN 260-98 are now covered under new SIN 260-1000.

<p>Note Regarding Publication:</p>
<p>Results from the work will be presented for external peer review and publication. Additional work may be required by a journal or other peer reviewed publication. Financial support will not be provided for this additional work; however, the contractor may choose to participate at no cost to the Government. Decisions on authorship will be made by CSR in a manner consistent with scientific standards for publication.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Requirements:</p>
<p>CSR will inspect the product after sample submission to ensure that the service meets quality standards and is on time.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:<br />The period of performance will be from the date of award through June 2, 2012. The date of award will be on or before April 9, 2012.</p>

THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES ARE APPLICABLE AND ARE HEREBY INCORPORATED INTO THE SOLICITATION BY REFERENCE AND BY FULL TEXT (Listed Below).

THE FULL TEXT OF THE CLAUSES/PROVISIONS FROM THE FAR AND DFARS CAN BE ACCESSED VIA THE INTERNET USING THE FOLLOWING WEB-SITE ADDRESS: www.arnet.gov or http://farsite.hill.af.mil

It is the responsibility of the Quoting Contractor(s) to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and or clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation.
  Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render a contractor(s) quote(s) to not be accepted by the Government. 

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items

NOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely. It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation. In addition, Quoting Contractors are instructed to complete and submit the attached past performance survey (found on the NECO site) with submitted quotes prior to the closing date of this notice specified herein.   

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items; 

(a)  The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Quoting Contractor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes.  

     (i)  CAPABILITY TO PERFORM
    (ii)  PAST PERFORMANCE
    (iii)  PRICE

(b)  Only those Quoting Contractors which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically capable of performing under Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating quotes determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is as important as Factor (iii), PRICE.  

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a purchase order without discussions with Quoting Contractors.  Each initial quote should, therefore contain the Quoting Contractors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.
   

(c)  By submitting a signed quote under this solicitation, Contractor asserts that it is technically capable of performing the specification/ statement of work and all aspects of this contract.  The contracting officer will validate contractors technical capability to perform by verifying that the contractor that supplied a quote has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract.  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, contractors will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the quote to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award.
  

(d)  Quoting Contractors PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the contractor supplying a quote has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Contractors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years with submitted quotes. 

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation (posted on the NECO site).  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information. 

A quoting Contractor which lacks relevant past performance history will receive a NEUTRAL rating for this factor.
  Any Quoting Contractor which has no relevant past performance history, while rated NEUTRAL, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the other quotes received.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate Quoting Contractors PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Quoting Contractor has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives demerit for this factor.

OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the quoting Contractor's past performance.

SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the Quoting Contractor's past performance.

MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the Quoting Contractor's past performance.


A written notice of award otherwise furnished to the successful Quoting Contractor within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a purchase order without further action by either party.
  Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may place a purchase order, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

This information should include contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers, delivery date, a description of the product and other relevant information.</p>
<p>Evaluation:</p>
<p>Award will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror IAW FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source Selection Process. The Government reserves the right to award no contract depending on the quality of the proposals. Proposals shall include pricing and technical capability in a written proposal per Instructions to Offerors.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a single contract made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. The Government intends to award without discussions, but reserves the right to conduct discussions if in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>a. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) Technical Capability -</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's technical capability to satisfy the GenSet Locomotive SOW and solicitation requirements. For the proposal to be technically acceptable, the Technical Capability factor must be rated as acceptable. The Technical Capability factor will result in one of the following evaluation ratings:</p>
<p>a. Acceptable: Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation <br />b. Unacceptable: Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Offeror must satisfy the proposal requirements in the Instructions to Offerors, Technical Capability, items 1 thru 9 (above) in order to be qualified as technically acceptable. If a proposal receives an "unacceptable" rating on the Technical Capability factor, the entire quote will receive an overall unacceptable rating, rendering it ineligible for award in the absence of discussions.</p>
<p>Past Performance: As part of the technical capability, this criteria will assess the ability of the offeror to perform successfully upon an evaluation of its relevant past performance history on work of the type and complexity described in the SOW. The past performance will be evaluated on:<br />i. Quality of Product/Service<br />ii. Similarity of products manufactured to the proposed<br />iii. Timeliness of Performance<br />iv. Overall Satisfaction Rating</p>
<p>Offerors without any record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. <br />(ii) Price<br />Total Price - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the offeror's proposed total price for the basic requirement (CLIN 0001) plus all proposed option total prices (CLINs 0002 thru 0006).</p>
<p>b. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.</p>
<p>c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>Representations and Certifications:<br /><br />All offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification-Commercial Items (Feb 2012).

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>The Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI's Operations and Management Division (OMD) in Washington provides OTI with an advanced level of operational and management support to help ensure ongoing and improved flexible, rapid response in political transition programming overseas. OTI/OMD is responsible for instituting and maintaining office-wide systems and processes, office practices and procedures, and the creation of an enhanced response capability through teamwork, responsiveness, fiscal responsibility, quality control, and customer service.</p>
<p>Within OMD, the Information and Technology (IT) Team is responsible for analyzing needs, developing solutions, and advising on issues related to business process and information management in direct support of OTI's numerous field programs. The IT team regularly participates in core DCHA/OTI process design, development and training exercises. The goal of the IT team is to create and maintain an enhanced response capability to support information management and effective processes for OTI field and Washington teams. The team accomplishes this through analyzing business process and information management needs in order to institute and maintain office-wide systems, processes, practices and procedures that support the overall mission of the office as well as address the needs of individual teams.</p>
<p>Program and operations staff in OTI work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to hire an Information and Technology (IT) Advisor within OTI's Operations and Management Division (OMD). The IT Advisor will provide administrative support for program funded U.S. Personal Services Contract (USPSC) employees and program operations in OTI. The OTI IT Advisor will be supervised by the Chief, Operations Management Division or his/her designee, and will also work under the general guidance and direction of the relevant OTI Team Leader for specific assignments.</p>
<p>This is a key position in an exciting and busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations overseas. For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support. The IT Advisor will provide ad hoc support and advice on IT matters and has the ability to maintain flexibility in a fast-paced dynamic environment while managing competing priorities and meeting aggressive deadlines. Providing knowledgeable, rapid response using standard operating procedures and making recommendations for improvements or innovations to increase effectiveness and efficiency is critical to successful implementation of OTI's programs and fulfillment of OTI's mandate.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire an Information and Technology (IT) Advisor within OTI's Operations and Management Division (OMD).</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Information and Technology Advisor requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the OTI Information and Technology Advisor requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The OTI Information and Technology Advisor is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The OTI Information and Technology Advisor is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The OTI Information and Technology Advisor has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. OTI Information and Technology Advisor is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>The IT Advisor is responsible for assisting in management of OTI's information and technology resources, and providing information, technology and communications support services for OTI program implementation staff. The IT Advisor is a member of OTI's Operations and Management Division's IT Team. Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI IT Team Leader or his or her designee, the IT Advisor will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull; Monitor and understand agency IT and Information Security systems, requirements and policies, especially as they affect OTI and implementing partner staff in the field. Analyze OTI business processes and work products in order to seamlessly integrate OTI's systems into agency systems, while also reducing redundancies in OTI systems whenever additions and/or changes occur in agency systems.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the IT Team in providing scheduled and ad hoc training for Washington and field-based staff on use of standard OTI information technology equipment and systems with a special focus on OTI-established web-based applications.</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of the OTI mandate, such as backstopping the IT Team members.</p>
<p>&bull; Travel overseas in fulfillment of duties as required.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide recommendations on OTI business system improvements or additions using current web technologies and techniques through the development, maintenance, and support of OTI's information management systems across all OTI field programs worldwide.</p>
<p>&bull; When required, perform some systems administration work primarily with regards to managing webservers and databases running on the Linux platform. Assist the IT Team in designing and maintaining product release and backup procedures.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Modification of previous notice to the draft RFP is to correct the answer previously posted to Question 28 and to answer additional questions.  Questions 1 through 33 have previously been answered.<br><br>28.  In the most recent amendment to the draft RFP, the Government states that the AS 9110 and AS 9100 certifications required under FAR 52.246-11 must be met by the prime contractor.  Since we intend to submit our proposal as a Joint Venture, will the Government allow the ISO 9001, AS 9100 and AS 9110 certifications that are held by the individual owners of a Joint Venture to be attributed to the Joint Venture as the Prime Contractor for purposes of satisfying Subfactor A-Corporate Capability, (a) Corporate Certifications and FAR 2-246-11?<br><br>Answer:  Offerors should ensure their approach complies with the "Limitation on Subcontracting clause 52.219-14".  This procurement is a total small business set-aside, joint ventures contemplating the submission of a proposal in response to this request for proposal should be mindful of 13 CFR 121.103(h)(3).<br><br>Paragraph H-15. Is there a need to establish a heavy metals baseline for each employee and continued exposure testing program?<br><br>Answer: This narrative has been deleted in the formal RFP.<br><br>35.	 Paragraph H-18 of RFP states: "H-18 WAIVER OF ALLOWABLE COSTS. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, for each of the contractor's accounting periods during the life of this contract, the parties agree that the Government shall not be billed or obligated to pay any of the following costs: (To be completed for offeror for any normally allowable cost, such as shift premiums, material handling, or facilities capital cost of money)."<br><br>Question: The term "such as" is used in the above reference. Is the Government requiring contractors to waive shift premiums, material handling, and facilities capital cost of money? Is this an opportunity to waive otherwise FAR based allowable costs or a mandate by this RFP?<br><br>Answer: This narrative has been deleted in the formal RFP.<br><br>36.	Paragraph L-25. Will the Government add the clause for New Mexico Services tax (FAR 52.229-10) to the solicitation?<br><br>Answer: No.<br><br>37.	Paragraph L-31 Item 3a(1) file Packaging - The Government is requesting in paragraph L-31 2(c) digital copies for each volume, apparently as separate disks. Paragraph L-31 Item 3a(1) says to zip all of the proposal files into one file entitled proposal zip. Does the Government require separate disks for each proposal volume or multiple disks that contain all proposal volumes zipped?<br><br>Answer: Paragraph L-29, 1) File Packaging has been revised in the formal RFP.  Each volume of the proposal shall be submitted on a separate DVD-R.  Offerors are instructed to submit their proposal in accordance with the instructions found in this section.<br><br>38.	 Paragraph L31 item 3c)(1) Contract Rate Pricing -  In the establishing of contract rate pricing tables of firm fixed price and cost plus fixed fee rates; can an offeror submit rates for subcontractors for the same labor category as a separate line item or should the rates of the prime contractor and subcontractors be blended based on the estimated hours provided with the tables?<br><br>Answer: The Government's intention is to have FFP and CPFF rate tables that are inclusive of subcontractors proposed as team members by the prime contractor. (Note: This includes all subcontractors who will be providing critical hardware/services or whose subcontract is for more than 10% of the total proposed price.) See section L-29 of the RFP for further instructions regarding the Contract Rate Pricing.  See also answer to Question #33.<br><br>39.	If the rates are to be binding for fixed price task orders, it is recommended that a contractor offeror be allowed to separate the fixed price hourly rate for the prime offeror and each individual subcontractor. Is this approach acceptable to the Government?<br><br>Answer: See answer to question 38.<br><br>40.	Will the Government provide an estimated number of labor hours by labor category to be used to form the offerors' basis for the rate pricing tables along with the estimate location of the support and provide a plug number for materials / ODC's based on historical orders?<br><br>Answer: See exhibit D in the formal RFP.  Hourly rates should not be dependent upon the location of the support.<br><br>41.	Will the contractor be allowed to adjust its proposed hourly fixed labor rate for the firm fixed<br>price rate table if a location not previously quoted in this solicitation is ordered or requested in an individual task order?<br><br>Answer: See answer to question 40.<br><br>42.	Will the Government provide historical labor hour order information under the current<br>incumbent's contract to aid the offeror in determining number of estimated labor hours by location that have been / or are likely to be ordered in the future?<br><br>Answer: This contract is not a level of effort type contract.  Hours will not be ordered.  There is no distinction of effort by location for this LSFMA requirement.<br><br>43.	Paragraph L31 item 3c)(1) Contract Rate Pricing - Background: Since there is no way for the Government to ascertain each specific future LSF task order requirements, an assumption is made that an IDIQ Multiple Award Contract (MAC) prime contractor (post IDIQ award) will be allowed to propose/add any subcontractors (subs, material vendors, service providers, consultants, other non-prime offeror support/materials) on a task order by task order basis to meet emerging Government warfighter requirements. At the point of Task Order Government Evaluation, the Government will evaluate subcontractor/materials proposal reasonableness.<br><br>Question: Does the Government concur that subcontractors/material providers can be added/proposed by an LSF MAC Prime on a task order by task order basis in order to tailor task order teams that meet unique LSF requirements?<br><br>Answer:  Each successful offeror under the multiple-award IDIQ contract will submit proposals tailored to specific delivery order requirements and will be evaluated.  See answer to question #38 regarding subcontractor pricing.<br><br>44.	Section L, Volume I - Technical, Subfactor A - Corporate Capability, Page 67<br>(c)(vii) The minimum tool/equipment requirements identifies an "Aviation Tool Set" as part of requirement to support the LSFMA.<br><br>Question: Will the National Stock Number (NSN) for this Tool Set be provided as Government Furnished Equipment?<br><br>Answer: See Attachment 0015 of the RFP.  Commercial equivalents are authorized where available.<br><br>45.	 As long as the prime contractor fulfills the 60 mile radius facility requirements for the solicitation, would there be any performance limitations for team members or subcontractors on task orders that they must be performed within the 60 mile radius?<br> <br>Answer:   The final RFP will reflect that the prime contractor's facility must be within 60 miles of Redstone Arsenal.  The requirements in Section L&M are applicable to the prime contractor.  Subcontractor opportunities are not restricted by the 60 mile requirement.  <br><br>46.	 Question: In the initial sources sought solicitation the requirement for ISO certifications and FAA Part 145 certification pose a question as to when the actual certifications need to be in full force.  The GAO, in their ruling on April 1, 2011, File B-404666, states that the certifications are due at the time of performance.  Will AMCOM adhere to this ruling?<br><br>Answer: Upon the conversion of the RFP from draft to final, the certifications will be required by the effective date of the award.<br><br>

Delivery method from contractor's facility to USCG customer will be by auger or pneumatic feed pellet delivery truck, with 28 foot auger or pneumatic equivalent pellet feed mechanism. Product delivered in bulk into facility silos from contractor's facility as required. Maximum capacity each silo is 100 TNS. Pellet Fuels Institute (PFI) premium pellet specifications will be required. Solicitation is projected to be issued February/March, 2012 timeframe. Separate Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) notification will be posted at fbo.gov sent when solicitation is issued. Indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) requirements type contract will be awarded, one year base contract with 2 option years. Pellet Fuels Institute (PFI) specifications as follows:</p>
<p>Product Specifications:<br />PFI Standard Specification for Residential/Commercial Densified Fuel<br />American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standards<br />PFI Wood Pellets are certified by the PFI North American Residential/Commercial Densified Fuel Standards Program. Below are the PFI Premium specifications required. <br />&emsp;</p>
<p><br />Fuel Property PFI Premium Specs<br />Normative Information - Mandatory <br />Bulk Density, lb/cubic foot: 40.0-46.0<br />Diameter, inches: 0.230-0.285<br />Diameter, mm: 5.84-7.25<br />Pellet Durability Index: greater than or equal to 96.5<br />Fines, % at the mill gate: less than or equal to 0.50<br />Inorganic Ash %: less than or equal to 1.0<br />Length, % greater than 1.50 inches: less than or equal to 1.0<br />Moisture, %: less than or equal to 8.0<br />Chloride, ppm: less than or equal to 300</p>
<p>Additional information regarding densified product:<br />To assure the consistent quality of densified fuel leaving the production facility, certified product must be packaged, stored, handled, transported, and/or delivered in a manner that will maintain the integrity of the densified fuel produced. As the quality of the densified fuel leaving the production facility is not decisive for customer satisfaction, but rather the quality of the densified fuels that arrive at the end consumer's location, the complete supply chain is considered. The minimum requirements for certified densified fuel packaging, storage, handling, transport, and delivery are as follows:<br />&bull;Densified fuel must not be exposed to moisture, e.g., through contact with condensed water, rain or snow.<br />&bull;Handling areas, silos conveyor equipment, storage containers, and transport vehicles must be regularly checked for soil and/or debris.<br />&bull;Equipment is to be cleaned if necessary to prevent contamination.<br />&bull;Wood pellets usually have a moisture content level of approx. 5-10%. Pellets tend to lose their effectiveness and crumble and thus become unusable if they are exposed to moisture or damp surfaces, therefore it is essential that the wood pellet remain dry for the entire transit, storage, and delivery cycle.<br />&bull;Certified densified fuel of one grade must not be allowed to co-mingle with densifed fuel product of another grade or with non-certified product.<br />&bull;Prospective contractors shall be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award. Contractors may register via the Internet at www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-866-606-8220<br />&bull;DLA point of contact is Joanie M. Brickhill, PH: 703-767-8524</p>

The applicable NAICS code is 237110, "Water and Sewer Line and related Structure Construction". The small business size standard is $33.5 million. This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis, open to large and small business concerns.
PURPOSE OF the contractSCOPE OF WORK: As part of its capacity building efforts in Iraq, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is working with the Government of Iraq (GOI) to renovate the Iraqi Ministry of Agricultures (IMOA) Al Sewaira Agricultural Research Station, located in Wasit province.   This USDA project is being managed by USDAs Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and is part of an overall United States Government effort to build capacity in various areas within the Government of Iraq.  USDA is working to build the capacity of the GOI in agricultural research and extension, as well as other agriculture-related subject areas. In a general Letter of Agreement between the USDA and the Iraq Ministry of Agriculture signed March 3, 2011, USDA and the IMOA agreed to collaborate on the renovation of the Al Sewaira Agricultural Research Station.  The Al Sewaira Research Station is located in Wasit province approximately 60 km (35 miles) southeast of Baghdad and covers approximately 150 hectares (375 acres or 625 donums) of fertile land.  It is located approximately 2,150 meters from the Al-Dohan canal, which is its primary source of water for irrigation.  Irrigation water is currently supplied from the canal via an open trench from the Al-Dohan Canal.  The Al Sewaira Research Station was established to conduct research on water management techniques and other aspects of agricultural production.  Its experimental fields are also used for extension purposes.  The major problems facing the Station are inadequate water supply, outdated and inefficient irrigation systems, and blockage of drainage pipes.  The renovation of the Station will improve the supply of irrigation water to the Station and improve the irrigation and drainage system used on the Station in order to improve the agricultural research and extension capacity of the Station.  FAS Office of Agricultural Affairs is located in the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq and is part of the FAS global network of agricultural economists, marketing experts, negotiators, and other specialists stationed in more than 90 countries to support U.S. agricultural interests.  One of the key objectives of the Agricultural Affairs Office is to develop a regionally competitive and sustainable agricultural and food sector in Iraq.USDA has an Agricultural Counselor stationed at the Embassy who serves as the senior USDA official in Iraq.  Also currently stationed there is a USDA Soil and Water Conservation advisor.  The USDA Agricultural Counselor and the USDA Soil and Water Conservation Advisor, or their designees, will be the contractors USDA points of contact in Iraq.  
The contractor will provide the personnel, labor, supervision, equipment, transportation, and materials needed to fulfill the requirements.  In summary, the contractor shall conduct the renovation of the Al Sewaira Agricultural Research Station in Iraq by:
1)	Confirming to USDA in writing through meetings and site visits, all of the equipment, materials and their specifications needed;

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to conduct a full and open competition under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (a) and in accordance with FAR Part 15 for the Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) Technology Development (TD) contract. NAVAIR does not intend to use the provisions of FAR Part 12 for this acquisition. The objective of the TD phase is to develop a cost effective jammer system to enhance aircraft survivability. NGJ is an electronic attack system that will provide significantly improved Airborne Electronic Attack capabilities against advanced threats through enhanced agility and precision within jamming assignments, increased interoperability and expanded broadband capability for greater threat coverage against a wide variety of radio frequency emitters. Initially, the NGJ system will be integrated on the EA-18G tactical aircraft to replace aging ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System pods. <br /><br />The successful offeror in the TD phase will be required to mature and demonstrate critical technologies, complete the system architecture, and complete the requirements derivation and decomposition to subsystems. The TD phase will include: (1) Technology Readiness Assessments (TRAs) that substantiate Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 for Increment 1 (mid-band) Critical Technology Elements (CTEs); (2) System Designs to a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) to establish the functional and allocated baselines for Increment 1; and (3) Refining technical trade space including those to improve affordability, system efficiency, and host platform compatibility. <br /><br />The Government intends to release a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) in early April 2012, including sections L&amp;M. Industry input will be sought prior to the release of the Formal RFP in mid June 2012. Proposals will be required 60 days after Formal RFP release. <br /><br />Publicly releasable unclassified documentation such as the RFP sections A-M will be posted directly on the NAVAIR Open Solicitation Homepage website (http://www.navair.navy.mil/) and listed under "Business Opportunities/Open Solicitations" as solicitation number N00019-12-R-0035. All subsequent RFP amendments and publicly releasable documentation will reside on the NAVAIR Open Solicitation Homepage and will not be posted to any other website to include FedBizOpps. <br /><br />Unclassified documentation with distribution statement restrictions such as the Statement of Work and Contract Data Requirement s Lists (CDRLs) will be made available through a secure website that will serve as an unclassified virtual bidder's technical library. Other documentation to include Industry Day briefs, the voluntary interested vendors list, and Industry Day Questions &amp; Answers will be posted to this library as well. Access to this library will be restricted to potential Prime Contractors. A list of all classified documentation will be hosted on the technical library along with procedures for access to these documents. Potential Contractors are asked to submit comments, questions, and requests for additional information directly to Kara Briscoe at kara.briscoe@navy.mil or by phone at (301) 757-7086.<br /><br />Please note that potential Prime contractors will need a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate and NAVAIR Applications (APPS) domain account to access the unclassified virtual bidder's external library. If a potential contractor does not already possess a PKI, please consult the following site for details on how to obtain a compliant Medium Assurance PKI certificate: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html. Be advised that this process can nominally take several weeks to complete. <br /><br />Potential Contractors must meet the requirements of the DD 254, Contract Security Classification Specification. To request access to the secure web site and to request transmittal of the classified documentation, potential Prime Contractors must contact the contract specialist, Kara Briscoe at kara.briscoe@navy.mil, with the following information: Company name, classified mailing address, phone number, email address (if available), current CAGE number, DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) number and acknowledgement of the contractor's responsibility under the U.S. export control laws and regulations. Potential contractors shall acknowledge that no dissemination of any export-controlled technical data subject to this requirement will occur in a manner that would violate applicable export control laws and regulations (DD Form 2345). Upon review of your written request, verification of your status and acknowledgement of the contractor's responsibility under the U.S. Export laws and regulations, the classified documentation, APPS account application and web site access instructions (https://www site address, user name, and password) will be provided. <br /><br />Prime Contractors shall be required to have completed the design effort for a NGJ system prototype prior to entry into TD. The Government will evaluate only those offerors' proposals that include a copy of a NAVAIR Design Readiness Review 2 (DRR2) letter stating that the exit criteria for a DRR2 has been met, establishing a product baseline for the offeror's NGJ system prototype. DRR2 is a tailored version of a Critical Design Review (CDR). The DRR2 will ensure a reasonable expectation of characterizing operational effectiveness and suitability of the design, and a plan to demonstrate technical maturity of at least a TRL 6 by the end of TD. Entry Criteria for the DRR2 shall be in accordance with the DRR2 checklist (tailored NAVAIR SETR CDR checklist).

<NTYPE>PRESOL
<CONTACT>Courtney Stallworth

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to add the missing attachments to the Draft PWS.  The two attachments are 1) Sample Tracking Data Example; and 2) Small System Data Specifications Example.  There are no other changes at this time.
TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UNREGULATED CONTAMINANT MONITORING REGULATION AND DRINKING WATER STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT (SOL-CI-12-00010)
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires contractor support to provide technical, analytical, and administrative support services for the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation (UCMR).  The Agency has the responsibility to investigate chemical and microbiological contaminant occurrence to characterize drinking water threats.  EPA relies on independent research efforts but also is heavily engaged in conducting occurrence studies to obtain new data.  The largest of these is the monitoring program mandated by the UCMR.  The UCMR is a cyclic monitoring program that allows the Office of Ground Water Drinking Water (OGWDW) to evaluate contaminant occurrence in finished drinking water.  Every five years EPA selects, through the process of regulatory proposal and promulgation, a new group of contaminants for monitoring.  Data collected under UCMR can then be correlated with the consumer population to conduct an assessment of contaminant exposure.  This assessmen t supports OGDW?s mandate to make determinations on the regulation of currently unregulated contaminants.
The RFP SOL-CI-12-00010 will be solicited as a total small business set-aside.  The applicable NAICS code designation for the acquisition is 541620 with a size standard of $14 million.  The Government anticipates award of a single Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF)-Term contract from this solicitation with a base year and five option years.  The period of performance for the resultant contract is anticipated to begin on or about August 1, 2012.  This is a follow-on to contract EP-C-06-041.
The solicitation is expected to be issued no earlier than April 9, 2012 on EPA?s website: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  This office does not intend to mail hard copies of the solicitation.  It is the responsibility of the offerors to frequently check the EPA website for updates or changes.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.  Contract award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting Negotiation.
Due to unavoidable organizational conflict of interests, the Government will exclude any entities that own or operate a certified analytical laboratory facility that performs drinking water monitoring and sample analysis for the UCMR and are therefore considered ineligible for award of this contract (See http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd).  A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) and draft Conflict of Interest Clauses can be obtained from the OAM website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.  The PWS and draft clauses are not final in nature but reflect EPA?s intentions at this time.
The point of contact for this solicitation is Courtney Stallworth, Contract Specialist, USEPA, 26 W. Martin Luther King Drive, Mail Code: NWD-001, Cincinnati, OH 45268, who may be reached via email at stallworth.courtney@epa.gov or via telephone at (513)487-2002.

<p>A sources sought notice was released in March 2011 to determine availability and capabilities of firms under the GSA IT Schedule 70 capable of providing the follow-on activities sought by the OCIO.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Due to an unforeseen delay in awarding the follow-on mechanism(s), at this time, the OCIO's current acquisition schedule anticipates master vehicle(s) award(s) in the third quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2012; with initial task orders competed and awarded by the third or fourth quarter of FY 2012.</p>
