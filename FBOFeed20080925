AETC CONS/LGCT , AFCESA Support Flight, 136 Barnes Avenue, Building 856 Annex, Tyndall AFB, FL 32403 is soliciting competitive offers for Air Force Utility Privatization Grissom AFRC, Indiana Natural Gas Distribution System.  Anticipated release of RFP for this effort is Jul 2008. 

Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. §2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority. Contract term is anticipated at 50 years. 

The following is a brief description of the system to be privatized:

The Grissom ARB natural gas distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Way.  The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters.  The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred.  The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system.  The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate.  The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Under no circumstances shall the Contractor be entitled to any service charge adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory.
Specifically excluded from the natural gas distribution system privatization are:  None.
Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSC) supplies natural gas to Grissom Air Reserve Base under an interruptible gas service contract. This type of contract allows the local utility to curtail gas service to customers on the interruptible agreement under extreme weather conditions when their priority customers, e.g., hospitals and residential customers, require the supply of additional gas. 
A single eight-inch (8”) pipeline enters the base at a fenced compound and runs alongside Harry Forman Drive.  Gas service is supplied to the base at 55 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) through a regulating station located on the service main ahead of the metering station and the installation distribution network.  The gas main passes through one metering and valve station, and gas is distributed to each facility at a reduced but variable pressure.  NIPSC owns and maintains the odorizing equipment.  There is a limited amount of tracer wire on the remaining system.  However the exact location and amount is unknown.  
The natural gas is distributed throughout the main base through approximately four miles of underground pipeline.  These lines are owned entirely by Grissom ARB.  The average depth of burial is 36”.  The gas main is constructed of either polyethylene pipe (PE), or in some locations, high-density polyethylene (HDPE).  There are 32 buildings within the cantonment area supplied natural gas directly.  The majority are not separately metered.  Grissom ARB deactivated their steam plant August 2000.  All facilities within the cantonment area are on alternative heating systems.
The NIPSC central metering point located was relocated from just inside the fence to a point by the truck scales.  There are ten government owned secondary metering points on base.  
The most significant impact to the natural gas system was the deactivation of the central steam heat plant and the construction of new support facilities inside the cantonment area.  A study of the heat plant identified potential energy savings in gas demand of 20-30% by converting individual buildings to alternative independent heating systems.  Additionally, the new facilities, while adding over 285,000-sq. ft. of heating space, replace over 400,000-sq. ft. of older less energy efficient structures.  The combined savings from both programs are estimated at 33.5% gas demand.
Grissom’s natural gas piping system is relatively new.  The entire gas main piping network was replaced under several different contracts between 1989 and 1997.  The mains include both PE and HDPE pipe according to construction drawings and discussions with NIPSC and shop personnel.  The specific locations and ranges of each type of distribution piping are not identifiable with assured accuracy. 
NIPSC provides maintenance on an as needed and emergency-repair arrangement with the base.  Over the last four years, only minor maintenance repairs were required.  NIPSC identified and satisfactorily corrected each problem.  NIPSC also maintains the repair records and documentation.

<a href="mailto:steve.manley@faa.gov">steve.manley@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>On September 10, 2008, the FAA's En Route and Oceanic Services Unit (ATO-E) announced a requirement for preparation and delivery of an Operational Safety Assessment (OSA) and an Operational Performance Assessment (OPA) in support of development of performance requirements for Surface Conflict Detection and Cockpit Alert Capabilities with consideration of arrival applications.  
An industry day was held on September 3, 2008 where details of the strategy to award multiple Memorandums of Agreement were explained.  The industry day briefing documents can be viewed at http://www.ads-b.gov.     
Prior announcements may be viewed as archived documents at http://faaco.faa.gov/  using key word "ADS-B".  
This announcement clarifies FAA expectations regarding vendor responses and provides answers to questions which are common to all potential vendors. 
The FAA plans to enter into Memorandums of Agreement with multiple vendors.  Under the agreements, vendors are expected to prepare as deliverables a draft OPA and OSA for a preliminary design review (PDR) and a final OPA and OSA for a critical design review (CDR).  Vendors are expected to determine what teaming arrangements, resources, and disciplines are needed to prepare and deliver the documentation.  The overall FAA strategy is for vendors to develop a team consisting of an avionics manufacturer and an airline in order optimize the delivered performance requirements and the associated validation demonstration.  
FAA envisions a cooperative interchange association with the successful vendors.  FAA will invite knowledgeable experts such as controllers, operations personnel, flight services personnel, etc. as required to participate in technical interchange meetings with the vendors as the work progresses.     
The knowledgeable experts will be drawn from either Government personnel or personnel under contract to support FAA.  Accordingly, vendor teaming arrangements under this effort should not include resources which are currently supporting the Surveillance and Broadcast Services program office such as Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and support contractors.  
The following answers are provided in response to specific industry questions.  
1.  Will the FAA meet with vendors individually (in person or teleconference) to address questions/issues after the Industry Day, but before final contract language is written? 
Response:  We will entertain E-mail questions to Steve.Manley@FAA.gov or clarifying telecons.  It is likely that some discussion will be necessary in finalizing the actual agreements.  
2. Will the FAA provide the surface map data (data base), or will is be from a 3rd party vendor?  Who is responsible for acquiring the airport surface map data? 
Response:  FAA will not provide surface map data.  The vendor is responsible for acquiring airport surface map data which is commercially available.  
3. Will the ground to air uplink of alert data (computed on the surface) be available in all the ASDE-X airports on the FAA list provided, or only specific airport(s)
Response:  Ground to air uplink of alert data will not be provided.  
4.  Will all vendors have access to the signal in space specification and protocols, or separate vendor to vendor/provider agreements is needed? 
Response:  Vendors will have access to signal in space, TIS-B data and essential services data as reflected in the essential services specification.  .

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), Regulatory Support Affairs contract will provide regulatory expertise, technical, and administrative support for DMID's clinical research programs.<br></br>
Research supported and conducted by the NIAID, NIH, DHHS, strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID, DMID supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents other than Human Immunodeficiency Virus. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics, which is funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.<br> 
</br>
Developing and testing new vaccines and therapies have historically been a major focus of the research supported by the DMID.  Much of this research is devoted to addressing critical public health needs, such as those related to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (e.g., avian influenza and West Nile Virus), as well as those supporting the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic candidates against potential agents of bioterrorism, including NIAID priority biodefense pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/bandc_priority.htm).<br>   
</br>
In order to ensure that the development, testing and manufacture of products evaluated under DMID-supported clinical research are executed with a rigor that will support licensure by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), DMID supports an infrastructure to provide regulatory assistance in the development and testing of these products.<br>  
</br>
Currently, DMID sponsors approximately 100 Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) or Master Files (MFs) which span more than 200 clinical trials.  This includes both multicenter trials and single center studies, and encompasses Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials performed at both domestic and foreign sites.  DMID files approximately 10-20 new INDs each year, and in this capacity, serves as the official IND sponsor and liaison with the FDA with respect to all regulatory requirements.  Currently, the DMID IND portfolio is comprised of approximately 75% vaccine and other biologic INDs (monoclonal), 20% drug INDs, and 5% MFs.  In addition, it is anticipated that Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) will be required during the contract period of performance.<br>
 </br>
It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a seven-year period of performance beginning on or about 
April 1, 2008.<br>  
</br>
Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about May 22, 2007 and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

In order to ensure that the development, testing and manufacture of products evaluated under DMID-supported clinical research are executed with a rigor that will support licensure by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), DMID supports the establishment and operation of a Clinical Agent and Specimen Repository (CASR) that adheres to current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP), Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) for the acquisition, receipt, storage and shipping of clinical agents and clinical specimens in support of DMID sponsored clinical trials and research programs in the U.S. and abroad.  Regulatory support services are currently being recompeted through a separate contract solicitation.

Clinical agents include investigational study products (drugs, vaccines, and therapeutics), commercial products, placebos, syringes, and other protocol-mandated supplies to be used in DMID-sponsored clinical trials.  For the purposes of this contract, other protocol-mandated supplies include electronic adherence measuring devices and associated devices for downloading data, thermometers, oral syringes, adaptors for transferring liquids from bottles to syringes, syringes for injection, and pregnancy test kits. Clinical specimens include sera or other protocol-mandated specimens obtained from DMID-funded clinical research sites, to be distributed to DMID-approved testing laboratories for analysis.

It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year base period of performance beginning on or about 
August 2008, with the following options:  Option 1: Increase clinical specimen capacity of the CASR in order to accommodate the following: -80oC (approximately 1600 cu. ft.) and -20oC (approximately 1600 cu. ft.). Option 2: Increase the length of time for the storage of clinical specimens in the CASR to exceed the short-term storage requirement of two (2) years as specified in the base requirement, to provide for storage until the end of the contract period of performance. Option 3: The Government may extend the contract for up to an additional two (2) years.  It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately as follows: for Option 1: 0.6 FTE; for Option 2: 0.4 FTE; and for Option 3: given that this is an expansion of the base, 11.05 FTEs would be required.

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about August 27, 2007, and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA is soliciting proposals to procure electronic parts on a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) basis to include the requirements listed below.The procurement is for approximately 300 different components.  Individual components will be specified in the Request for Quote.  The components may be listed by Brand Name and part number as it is impractical to develop specifications for each individual component.  Anyone proposing an alternate part number/ manufacturer is required to clearly demonstrate that the substitute is equal to the specified part number/manufacturer.  Per PGI 211.105, a justification for using brand names is required.  That justification is as follows: due to the vast quantity of electronic components being purchased, and the impracticality to describe each component and its functionality in a manner that would promote competition, we have opted to give brand names and part number, which allows potential offerors to decide if they have a component that has the same function. This competitive procurement is processed under the simplified acquisition procedures at FAR Part 12 and 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The solicitation will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online website at http://www.neco.navy.mil and the FEDBIZOPPS website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about October 27, 2008.

The response shall be in writing to Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Code 210000D Attn: Margaret Keen, 429 E. Bowen Rd., Stop 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108.

SUP 5252.213-9402 Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance-Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (Apr 1999)
ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet.(b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, f! irst article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.  (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows:	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed.	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.(e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data.

<DESC>Fleet and Industrial Supply Center-Norfolk, Contracting Department, Norfolk Naval Shipyard Maritime Industrial Division intends to contract for services to transport, treat and dispose of Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program (NNPP) mixed waste components on a sole source basis to EnergySolutions, LLC (formerly Envirocare of Utah, Inc.).  The proposed requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis via Request for Proposal N00189-08-R-E018.  The requirement shall be awarded as an indefinite delivery/requirements type contract with firm fixed unit prices for a base ordering period of one (1) year with four (4) one year options utilizing FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  All options will be evaluated with the base period.  These components may contain radioactive lead solids and painted exterior surfaces with Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) regulated polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) greater than 50 ppm and Resource Conversation and Recovery Act (RCRA) heav! y metals such as cadmium, chromium and lead.  These components will be controlled as mixed waste.  Mixed waste is a waste that has both a hazardous component (defined under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) - 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 260 through 270) and a radioactive component (i.e. source, special nuclear, or by-product material subject to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954).  In addition, some mixed waste may contain State-only wastes, asbestos, and/or Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) regulated polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).  As identified in 40 CFR Part 268 Subpart D, macroencapsulation is the required treatment technology for radioactive lead solids.  As identified in 40 CFR Part 761.62, disposal in a hazardous waste landfill permitted by EPA is the required treatment technology for TSCA regulated PCB bulk product waste.  The desired treatment and disposal method for these components is in-cell macroencapsulation within a contractor ow! ned and operated Subtitle C landfill.  The large components are Department of Energy (DOE) classified components requiring Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory approved controls to be used to prevent access by uncleared vendor personnel to classified or sensitive information and to permit treatment and disposal of the components on an unclassified basis.  The Contractor will be required to have in place a security plan with procedures for governing the secure management of Unclassified-Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information (U-NNPI) waste.  The security plan must also establish a method for unloading, transporting, processing and disposing  of U-NNPI waste in accordance with DOD/DOE approved security procedures.  The contractor will be required to:
	(1)	Receive mixed waste from the following NNPP sites:		Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY), Portsmouth, VA;		Naval Operations Base (NOB), Norfolk, VA;		Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNS), Kittery Maine;		Trident Refit Facility (TRF), Kings Bay, GA;		Trident Refit Facility (TRF), Bangor, WA;		Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance			Facility (PNS & IMF), Bremerton, WA;		Point Loma Naval Base, San Diego, CA;		Naval Air Station North Island (NASNI), San Diego, CA;		Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance			Facility (PHNSY & IMF), Pearl Harbor, HI;		Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory (KAPL), Kesselring Site 		Operations, West Milton, NY;		KAPL, Knolls Site, Niskayuna, NY;		Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory, West Mifflin, PA;		Naval Reactors Facility, Idaho Falls, ID;		Nuclear Regional Maintenance Department (NRMD), New London CT		Nuclear Power Training Unit (NPTU), Charleston, SC;		Electric Boat Shipyard (EB), New London, CT		Northrop-Grumman Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock			(NGNN), Newport News, VA
	(2)	Treat the regulated constituents to meet the treatment standards		identified in 40 CFR Part 268 Subpart D, 40 CFR Part 761.62 and		the disposal site waste acceptance criteria.
	(3)	The contractor's treatment technologies must comply with all 		Federal, State, and Local regulations.
	(4)	Perform all work (i.e., actual processing, treatment, and disposal		of the components) in the continental United States.
	(5)	Process the components within the timeframe for which the 		contractor is licensed, not to exceed one (1) year from the date		the waste is received by the contractor.  
	(6)	Dispose of waste at the contractor owned and operated		Subtitle C landfill.
	(7)	Propose appropriate safeguards that will be approved by the 		Contracting Officer for security from actual, potential, or 		inadvertent release by the contractor of any Naval Nuclear		Propulsion Information (NNPP) in any form, classified or 		unclassified.  
	(8)	Provide facilities, materials, licenses, and permits necessary to 		transport, receive, store, treatment and dispose of all wastes		generated under the contract.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 811219   On behalf of the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), National Decontamination Team - the purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification (Service Disabled Veteran-Owned; Veteran OwnedSmall Business; Women Owned Small Business; HubZone 8(a); 8(a); HubZone; Small Business; Emerging Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) and Large Business relative to NAICS code 811219 (size standard of $6.5 million).  Response to this request for information synopsis will be used by the government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  Responses to this RFI shall NEITHER constitute responses to a solicitation (which is not currently available) NOR a request to be added to a prospective bidders list to receive a copy of the solicitation.  The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely the Government's discretion.  This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.  Respondent will not be notified of the result of this announcement.  However, the information received will be utilized to assist in formulating the strategy for competitive procurements.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, hereafter referred to as USEPA, is seeking information from potential offerors to provide a mechanism for conducting maintenance, modifications, and upgrades to existing and new Infrared (IR) systems used by the Airborne Spectral Photometric Environmental Collection Technology (ASPECT) program.  Most but not all of this effort will be focused around the existing MR-254AB spectrometer.  This contract will also provide a capability to assist the government in various field test and data collection programs.  Based on the dynamic nature of the ASPECT program, the contract will also provide a mechanism to examine, construct and evaluate new systems to enhance the mission of ASPECT.BACKGROUND:  Under the authority of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) of 1980, as amended: Section 311 of the Clean Water Act (CWA), as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA); and pursuant to the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP); and Presidential Decision Document (PDD) #39, the EPA has been delegated the responsibility to undertake response actions with respect to the release or threat of release of oil, petroleum products, hazardous substances, or pollutants and contaminants, that pose an actual or potential threat to human health or welfare, or to the environment.  EPA is responsible for conducting evaluations of uncontrolled hazardous substance release sites.In addition, EPA has authority, under the Emergency Preparedness and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), the Robert T. Stafford Natural Disaster Act pursuant to the Federal Response Plan (FRP) and other laws to help address and or mitigate endangerment of the public health, welfare or environment during emergencies and natural disasters and to support other federal agencies, states and communities in preparing for and responding to releases of oil, petroleum products and other hazardous substances.THE US EPA, NDT is the unit responsible for the operation of the Agency's standoff detection project called ASPECT.  This program is an emergency response program and has the primary mission of remote detection of chemical vapors, plumes, and clouds during times of need.The main components of remote chemical sensor packages typically consist of infrared detectors and their associated control systems, geo-spacial locators, computers and communication equipment.  Reliable operation of the ASPECT system is mandatory due to the emergency response nature of the program.  The program currently uses two suites of identical sensor packages with one set being in flight status and the other serving as a backup.  Sensors and instruments are pulled from flight status at routine intervals for preventive maintenance or after a unit have failed to operate correctly.Maintenance and/or repair of the sensor must be accomplished in as short a time as possible to prevent down time of the program.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and FAR Part 12 Commercial Items, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with MIDAC Corporation, 130 McCormick Ave. Costa Mesa CA, to purchase a Fourier Transforming Infra Red (FTIR) spectrophotometer system for the Office of Research and Development/National Health & Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL), in RTP, NC.
NHEERL requires a system that will perform simultaneous measurements of two inhalation exposure chambers (a dual system) concentrations of volatile organic compounds, standard emissions from vehicle engines, stack effluents, and standard gases.
A.  MINIMUM GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS:  
1.  The system must be able to measure temperature and pressure and transmit that data to allow the operational software to compensate for the effects of both.  The system should have multiple analog inputs/outputs, digital inputs/outputs to allow interfacing between it and other computers or sensors to allow simple communications between each other.  The system should have a digital input to receive a signal from our data acquisition system allowing the spectrophotometer to know which chamber it is sampling.
2.  The system must be designed as an industrial grade system (process type/use) for use in harsh environments.  The interferometers (2) must be of 90 degree Michelson design or modified Michelson design with 0.5 cm(-1) resolution.  The interferometers optics should be in the Mid-IR rang [7000 ? 400 cm(-1)] and may be coated for protection.  The instrument is required to have two (2) ADC?s (analog to digital converters) 20 bit data collection which increases sensitivity.  The interface between the control PC9s) and instrument ADC?s resolution.  The units should run on 110/120 volt 60 Hz power, single phase.
3.   The system control and data acquisition software must allow for unattended operations.  The software should allow the control PC?s to calculate the concentration of the selected compound, selection of various gases and should allow custom calibrations to be done by the operator, as well as Quality Control/Assurance testing. The software should allow batch re-process previously collected data. The data files (spectra) should be compatible with GRAMS/AI software (industry standard) for visualization, quantifying and reporting data from various spectroscopic instruments.   4.  The sampling compartment of each instrument needs to be a gas cell of the ?White Design?, a non-reactive casing, mirrors should be gold coated to allow maximum light throughput and non reactive, a fixed path length of 6 meters to allow the concentration determination of assorted gaseous compounds from ppm to percent (%) levels, be of a volume (approximately 285 milliliters) that will allow the rapid (2 minutes) exchange of compounds at a flow rate of 1.5 liters per minute, the, and be able to withstand temperatures from room temperature (15?C) to 240?C.
5.  The detector module needs to be a ?DGTS? detector to operate at room temperature (12 ? 25 Deg C?) without liquid nitrogen cooling with a minimal spectral range of 400 - 5000 cm-1 wavenumbers. 
6.  Performance criteria lowest detectable limit with 5 minute measurement: NH3 = 0.1 ppm, CO2 = 0.05 ppm, NO2 = 0.05 ppm, SO2 = 1 ppm, Xylene = 0.1 ppm
7.  The data acquisition and instrument control system can be a PC or Laptop.  If a PC it must minimally be:  Intel Pentium 4, 2.5 GHz, 512 MB RAM, 80 GB hard drive, CD-RW drive, integrated graphics controller, keyboard, mouse, 17? SVGA Flat panel monitor.  If a laptop it must minimally Intel Pentium M 1.73 GHz, 512 MB RAM, 40+ GB hard drive, CD-RW drive, 14 inch XGA monitor, integrated graphics controller.  Common to either MS XP pro or Windows 2000 operating system and must be Section 508 compliant.
8.  Orientation of the Gas cell. The preferred orientation of the gas cell is horizontal to prevent any liquids for depositing on the optics or mirrors, and allow the cell to be drained if there is liquid intrusion or condensation.
9.  The footprint of the analytical instrument (including the gas cell) should fit in an area that is 26? X 26?X 30? 
B.  FIELD INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS AND APPROVAL BY THE NORTH CAROLLINA BUILDING CODE COUNCIL:

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLICIT USING 
OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

USA Armed Forces Recruiting 
225 E. 16th Street
Denver, CO 80203

This is a notice of intent for the General Services Administration to solicit space for the USA Armed Forces Recruiting (USAF) in Denver, Colorado.  The Government anticipates negotiating a succeeding lease at the existing location (225 E. 16th Street, Denver, CO 80203) which currently provides 23,440 usable square feet of contiguous office and a minimum of 27 reserved parking spaces, 13 of which must be covered parking spaces, for Government vehicles.  GSA is interested in considering alternative space if relocation is economically advantageous to the Government.  In making such a determination, GSA will consider cost factors including, but not limited to, the total cost of the physical move (including telecommunications and computer cabling costs); tenant improvement costs (whether included in the rent or compensated separately from the rent); and anticipated rent for the space.  Proximity to employee services, such as moderately priced restaurants, banks, public transportation, and a fitness center, as well as hotel accommodations for visitors is also necessary.  Other factors impacting the Government’s rights under a prospective lease, such as the length of any firm term that may be required at an alternative location, length of time necessary to deliver occupancy-ready space, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term, will also bear.

Space must be located within three blocks of the present leased location.  Space must meet the Federal Government's standards for fire safety, be capable of being fully accessible to the physically challenged, and be located outside a 100-year floodplain.  Space must be ready for occupancy on February 24, 2009, or sooner.  A lease term of 5-years firm is sought.     

Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building’s ownership.  If you desire to submit a location for inspection, please forward information by 5:00 PM EDT, October 8, 2008.  Expressions of interest should include building name and address, location of space in the building, rentable square feet offered and rentable rate per square foot (specifying services and utilities included), ANSI/BOMA defined usable square feet, percentage of common area factor used to determine the rentable square feet, one-eighth inch scale drawing of space offered, and contact information for owner or authorized agent. 

Required:  All services, supplies, utilities, and tenant alterations to be provided as part of the rental consideration.  
Occupancy:  The space is required on or before February 24, 2009.  
Term:  The lease term will be for 5 years firm.  
GSA Contracting Officer: Dan McPherson, 303-236-8000 ext 2359. Owners/Agents:  Any expressions of interest should be directed to Brian L. Wells of CB Richard Ellis, 1225 17th Street Suite 2950, Denver, CO 80202, Phone: 303-628-1706, Fax: 303-628-1751, E-mail:  brian.l.wells@cbre.com.

The Corps nonfederal partner on the Delaware Estuary Salinity Monitoring Study is the South Jersey Port Corporation (SJPC).   SJPC has contracted with SFI to conduct various tasks associated with the Delaware Estuary Salinity Monitoring Study.

Those tasks include utilizing a physical model to identify dominant circulation phenomena in Delaware Bay, and assess current population distribution patterns and movements of sturgeon in the Delaware River and Bay by expanding upon acoustic telemetry studies currently in place.    No RFQ will be issued based on this notice.  However, all information received within five (5) calendar days after date of publication of this notice will be considered SOLELY for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for information received.  All contractors are required to be registered in the DoD Central Contractor<BR>Register before award as required by DFARS 204-7300.  Information on obtaining registration may be obtained by phoning 1-888-227-2423 or by accessing the following internet website:  http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR6.302-2, its the Government's intent to award a Sole Source to Azimuth, Inc., 3741 Morgantown, WV 26501 for the purchase of services for a administrative and project management support of 1 personnel for the duration of 6 months.  This is not a formal solicitation.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  All responsilbe source may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered bu the agency.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that cmpetition would be most advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the purchase will be awarded without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based in this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Sole Source is attached for reference.  Detailed capabilities, proposal, or quote must be submitted to the following email address no later than 9:00 a.m. eastern standard time, 27 September 2008.  Email:  erin.becker@amedd.army.mil.<BR><BR><BR>Urgent and Compelling Justification for Sole Source Award<BR><BR>Background:  TATRC's Advance Information Technology Group (AITG) is responsible for the integration, prototyping and fielding of information management technologies, emerging technologies and other telemedicine projects and systems to satisfy Department of Defense and Army Medical Department requirements.  The AITG utilizes the OASIS, developmental test and evaluation platform, as its laboratory to perform all integration and prototyping actions required for the division's advanced technology, telemedicine, hospital information and communication projects.  Management support and project engineering support is required within the division, and the Oasis to facilitate project planning and management, operations, logistics and personnel actions, related to current ongoing and future projects<BR><BR>The OSIS Site Manager contract involves project management, conduct of day-to-day operations, site and equipment repairs and maintenance, and property accountability.  The previous support contract expired 25 Aug 2008, and all service was terminated on that date with no follow-on contract in place.  The lack of a support contract has created a serious situation where coordination and planning for upcoming tests and demonstrations has been severely compromised.  On-going maintenance and repairs have ceased.  Property accountability for the $1.3 million hand receipt is compromised due to the lack of daily visibility that the on-site manager provides.  Management tasks to monitor site conditions insuring that shelters and equipment are prepared for inclement weather and storm conditions have been severely compromised due to the lack of manpower.  <BR><BR>Need:  Therefore, TATRC is requesting that a sole source award be made to Azimuth, Inc, a service-connected disabled veteran-owned small business based upon urgent and compelling circumstances.  Azimuth is a proven reliable vendor and has past performance history in supporting TATRC with OASIS project management on a previous contract.  They are ready and able to implement immediate support.  This requirement will be for $ 79,806.<BR><BR>Justification:  Approving an immediate sole source award to Azimuth will re-establish the capability to execute the prototyping actions required for the AITGs advanced technology, telemedicine, hospital information and communication projects.  Failure to award a contract immediately will delay prototyping projects that could possibly result in the loss of funding.  The lack of a contract greatly increases the risk of compromising property accountability of a hand receipt valued at over $1.3 million.  Access control to the OASIS site and visibility of equipment entering and leaving the site is absolutely essential to preventing loss of equipment.  TATRC does not have the manpower to provide this capability and relies on this service contract to provide that capability.  Constant repair and maintenance is required to keep the shelters, environmental control units, generators and ancillary equipment operational to support prototyping activities.  This cannot be accomplished without the manpower provided by this service contract.<BR><BR>Bottom Line:  TATRC has an urgent and compelling need for a follow-on service contract for OASIS Site Management to be awarded immediately.<BR><BR>Approval:                         24 September 2008<BR>Fay J. Peiffer			     DATE<BR>Contracting Officer<BR>

<DESC>B- Uganda: Balancing Biofuels and Food Security Technical Assistance

POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  PLEASE DO NOT CONACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Godfrey Ndawula; Head Procurement and Disposal Unit; Amber House; 1st Floor Room C109; Plot 23/29; Kampala Road; P. O. Box 7270; Kampala, Uganda.  

The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD) of Uganda, the Grantee, invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for Balancing Biofuels and Food Security.

Uganda’s rapidly growing demand for electricity necessitates further public and private investment in power infrastructure projects.  Recently, Uganda has experienced prolonged drought, significantly reducing the production of its hydroelectric power plants.  This, combined with the sharp increase of global fuel prices, has led to substantial increases in energy costs in Uganda, hitting the industrial and business sectors particularly hard.  Fortunately, Uganda has an abundance of indigenous energy resources including biomass, hydropower, solar and geothermal energy, which are gradually beginning to be exploited.  

To take advantage of these resources, the Ugandan government is currently pursuing a new set of policies, including the recently passed Renewable Energy Policy, to encourage the development of renewable energy resources, especially biofuels.  In order to support those efforts, the government has requested assistance in designing regulatory framework which will encourage the development of a biofuels industry without jeopardizing the country’s food supply.   Specifically, the US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA)-funded technical assistance will assist the government in establishing biofuel quality regulations, content monitoring, regulations for testing facilities, tax incentives, blending requirements, and analysis of potential feedstocks and tariff requirements.

The Government of Uganda (GOU) is concerned that without proper guidance and regulation the development of a biofuels industry could have adverse effects on local farmers and potentially raise the cost of food.  Since the majority of Uganda’s population lives below the poverty line, the GOU does not want to inadvertently develop an industry that would have a detrimental impact on the majority of its population. Therefore, the government has requested USTDA assistance to conduct the following: 
(1) perform an analysis of the potential biofuel market within Uganda; 
(2) compare potential biofuel resources and technologies, and provide cost-benefit analyses to show the true impact of developing one resource verses another; and 
(3) recommend appropriate regulations to govern the market and potential incentives for the development of safe and responsible biofuel production.  

Technical Assistance Components:

•Task 1: Conduct Project Kick-Off Meeting
•Task 2: Prepare Market Estimates
•Task 3: Indentify and Compare Potential Biofuel Resources
•Task 4: Prepare an Investment Plan to Implement the Strategic Blueprint
•Task 5: Conduct Economic Analysis for Generic Biofuel Refineries
•Task 6: Review Regulation and Incentives for Development
•Task 7: Determine Developmental Impacts
•Task 8: Prepare Lists of Proposed Equipment and Services
•Task 9: Conduct Preliminary Socio-Economic and Environmental Impact Analysis
•Task 10: Prepare Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $527,280 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW) intends to release a solicitation to acquire Command and Control System-Consolidated (CCS-C) Block 2 upgrades in support of Transformational Satellite Communications (TSAT) S-Band operations, Wideband Global SATCOM  (WGS) Block 2 satellites, and other MILSATCOM programs.  In addition, CCS-C architecture extensions will support NetCentric command and control and Information Assurance requirements identified by Headquarters Air Force Space Command will be supported. The CCS-C development and deployment will support the launch, on-orbit operations, and anomaly resolution of the TSAT satellites from its command and control system through the AFSCN (Air Force Satellite Control Network). CCS-C capabilities include: activity planning; telemetry processing; commanding; orbit management; resource management; space vehicle and ground system simulation; support planning and execution; and interfaces with dedicated ground and payload control systems.  Satellite platform and payload state-of-health operations include launch, early-orbit, on-orbit, anomaly resolution, and disposal operations.  Future migration to USB (Unified S-Band) waveforms and data formats shall be supported.  Contractor must be able to sustain existing CCS-C hardware, software, databases, and command procedures.  Continuing upgrades to address Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) hardware and software obsolescence are anticipated.
The period of performance is anticipated to be for 10 years and will begin in FY09 lasting through FY19. This is a follow-on effort to the existing CCS-C development, procurement and support contract currently performed by Integral Systems Inc. (ISI), 5000 Philadelphia Way, Lanham, MD 20706-4417.  The projected Request for Proposal (RFP) release date for this effort is October 2008.  On-site locations include but are not limited to Schriever AFB, CO and Vandenberg AFB, CA.  A minimum DoD security clearance of Secret is mandatory for all personnel supporting this effort.  

Interested Contractors must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) by 5:00 pm (Pacific) on Tuesday, 8 January 2008 demonstrating knowledge of CCS-C hardware and software design and test procedures.  The submission must also include an assessment of actual, potential, or perceptions of Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) through the submission of an OCI Mitigation Plan.  The mitigation plan will be evaluated to ensure proper safeguards are implemented or will be implemented to protect the Government's interests and to identify perceptions of bias and unmitigable OCIs in accordance with FAR 9.5. OCIs can occur at any level; prime, subcontractor, or other types of teammates.  Additionally, there are two underlying principles of OCI; 1) conflicting roles that might bias or impair a contractor's judgment, and 2) unfair competitive advantage (where a competing contractor has access to proprietary information of a competitor(s) or has access to source selection information that is not available to all competitors). Negative replies are requested indicating no actual, potential, or perceptions of OCI were identified. The OCI plans must also be in compliance with the current version of the SMC OCI checklist, attached and also available upon request from the contracting officer, Herbert Countee. 

The SOC shall not exceed 20 one-sided pages in length.  This page limit is for the SOC only and does not include the required OCI Mitigation Plan submission  Response must be submitted by e-mail in electronic form in MS Word 2002 or higher or PDF Format.  All responses must conform to 8.5 by 11.0 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)Scientist Participant Suborbital Research Program All Mission DirectoratesNASA General Information: Solicitation Number: NNH08ZDA011L Release Date: September 23, 2008 Response Date: December 5, 2008 Classification Code: A -- Research and Development The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recognizes the advancement ofthe commercial suborbital spaceflight industry and requests information on potentialflight experiments enabled by this capability. NASA is determining whether this newplatform represents a unique, efficient, cost-effective way of doing business for theagency and is eager to explore all possibilities represented by the various options soonto be available from a variety of commercial providers. NASA is in the formulation phaseof a possible new program to fly government-sponsored payloads and/or researchers oncommercial suborbital systems with the intent of advancing NASAs research goals andobjectives across Directorates, including the Space Operation Mission Directorate and theExploration Systems Mission Directorate. Responses to this RFI will be used to informNASAs program planning. Background: Suborbital missions have provided an important arena for astronomical, terrestrial, andother areas of space research, including technology demonstration, for over 60 years.They offer the opportunity to make astronomical and Earth observations at wavelengths andspecial observing geometries not accessible from the ground; they also offer theopportunity to study microgravity and other phenomena related to the fundamental physicsof the space and Earth sciences. Additionally, suborbital platforms offer cost effectiveaccess to space to test and qualify new instruments and technologies that cut acrossdisciplines. Research activities range, for example, from in-situ sampling of atmosphericregions that neither spacecraft nor aircraft can reach, to making celestial observationsthat are not possible with currently operating spacecraft, to testing science andspacecraft instruments before committing to orbital or interplanetary flight.The emergence of human suborbital flight for commercial purposes now offers a natural andtimely opportunity to open a new research venue to the broader NASA research community.The potential to fly a researcher with the payload could reduce the hardware and autonomyrequirements of many potential payloads. In addition, the potential to fly a smallunaccompanied payload regularly and frequently also opens broad avenues of research inEarth System Sciences and other fields.The Science Mission Directorate at NASA issued a RFI in February 2008 requestinginformation on human tended suborbital science investigations that address NASAs scienceobjectives in astrophysics, Earth science, heliophysics, and planetary science. NASA iscurrently soliciting proposals for funded concept studies of human tended suborbitalscience investigations in those four science disciplines through the ResearchOpportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 2008 (ROSES-08) NASA Research Announcement(NRA) (NNH08ZDA001N-HTSS) (proposals are due December 5  see http://nspires.nasaprs.com/    , select Solicitations, select Open Solicitations, select NNH08ZDA001N, selectList of Program Elements, select Concept Studies for Human Tended SuborbitalScience).In this RFI, NASA is soliciting ideas and comments from the science, research, andtechnology communities on potential suborbital investigations with the option of, but notlimited to, a human in the loop that support any of NASAs goals. With input fromresponses to this RFI, NASA intends to (i) consider acquiring commercial suborbital seatsand/or flights for NASA-funded researchers to conduct suborbital investigations and (ii)consider an additional solicitation for proposals for suborbital investigation conceptstudies that address NASAs research needs, especially those in science disciplinesbeyond those included in the current ROSES-08 solicitation. For an overview of NASAsstrategic goals and objectives refer to The 2006 NASA Strategic Plan (2006), available athttp://www.nasa.gov/about/budget      .It is NASAs intent to consider a formal solicitation for suborbital spaceflight servicesin 2009, which could lead to a pilot program of suborbital flight operations in2010-2011. If so requested in your response, all information received from this RFI will beconsidered confidential and proprietary, however NASA may use responses to aid thedrafting of an open solicitation for research investigations. It is not NASAs intent to publicly disclose proprietary information obtained during thisRFI. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Actand other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as Proprietary orConfidential will be kept confidential. It is emphasized that this RFI is for planningand information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by theGovernment to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay forinformation solicited. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If asolicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOps and on the NASA AcquisitionInternet Service.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS) intends to award a Fixed Price type sole source purchase order to the Minnesota IMPLAN Group in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2),  only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements
IMPLAN is a widely used, commercial input-output modeling software and data system originally developed by the U.S. Forest Service and the University of Minnesota. The 2007 data will update the economic multipliers in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Economic Impact Model MAG PLAN, which is used for the equitable sharing analysis in 5-year program development, for 5-year and lease sale environmental impact statements, and for similar, more limited, analyses.  In addition, the 2007 data will be the first data to incorporate the major, economy-wide revisions based on the 2002 Input-Output Benchmark tables developed from the Economic Census and released late last year. The approach used to design MAG-PLAN was approved by the Associate Director for Offshore Minerals Management prior to development of any MMS OCS Economic Impact Models.  MAG-PLAN was designed specifically to incorporate the IMPLAN multipliers; no other vendor offers equivalent data that could be incorporated without a major, and very expensive, modification of the model.  The Minnesota IMPLAN Group, Inc., (MIG) develops and maintains both the IMPLAN software and the IMPLAN databases and is the only company authorized to sell either.  
This notice is not a formal solicitation. This is not considered a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No purchase order will be awarded on the basis of quotation or offers received in response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling, and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received by the POC listed below by 2:00PM current Eastern Time October 10, 2008, will be considered by the government.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and the solicitation.  A full copy of the solicitation may be obtained by emailing the contracting officer directly at Kimberly.Luke@mms.gov.  Clearly indicate the solicitation number (M08PS00137), company name and point of contact.
Project Background - MMS would like to assemble a group of 3-6 consultants to provide expert advice to MMS employees concerning its regional economic impact modules and sources for model data.  
MAG-PLAN was developed on the Microsoft Access platform and provides MMS an integrated framework for using IMPLAN multipliers to estimate the regional macro-level socioeconomic impacts in one model.  (Note: IMPLAN multipliers are the coefficients used in the input-output analysis based on inter-industry relationships to calculate the direct, indirect, and induced impacts.  In simpler terms, they estimate the ripple effects that occur throughout the economy after any new initial spending.  More information can be found in the IMPLAN Pro User's Guide or at www.implan.com.) In the broadest terms, MAG-PLAN consists of two stages and requires an MMS-developed Exploration & Development (E&D) scenario to run. E&D scenarios are MMS estimates of the oil-and-gas-related activities that are likely to occur as the result of a proposed action such as a lease sale or collection of lease sales.  The first stage of MAG-PLAN estimates the level and allocation of expenditures resulting from anticipated OCS oil and gas projects based on the activities specified in the E&D scenario.  In this stage, MAG-PLAN uses existing data to translate the E&D-specified level of each kind of activity (e.g., drilling an exploratory well, constructing and laying a mile of pipeline, or operating and maintaining a production facility for a year) into expenditures.  It then allocates these expenditure estimates among several hundred industry sectors (NAICS-based IMPLAN codes), and distributes the resulting sector-specific expenditures among user-designated Onshore Areas (OSA's).(Note: Technically, MAG-PLAN's first-stage, "direct" spending estimates include what traditionally would be considered the first round of "indirect" spending.)  The second stage of MAG-PLAN estimates the ripple effects of that spending on each OSA, using IMPLAN multipliers to estimate the economic output, employment, and other economic effects.
Project Objectives - The purpose of this contract is to assemble a group of 3-6 consultants that would provide expert advice to MMS employees concerning the updating of MAG-PLAN data and operations.  
Qualifications - Membership of the Modeling Review Board will reflect the depth and range of knowledge useful for guiding these studies to update the two MAG-PLAN models.  Applicants will be selected based on the depth, range, and relevance of their educational backgrounds, their industry and/or research experience, and their areas of expertise as well as on the range of expertise required for the Board itself.  Each board member must demonstrate one or more of the qualifications listed at the end of this paragraph.  Applicants should submit documentation (such as a written narrative of several paragraphs describing the experience or copies of research papers) for at least one qualification listed below.
1. In-depth understanding of the offshore oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico.
MMS is looking for extensive experience working for, consulting for, or studying/ analyzing the offshore oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico, especially in regard to activities that generate high levels of spending, such as drilling or platform fabrication.  An understanding of support industries would be helpful.
2. In-depth understanding of the activities necessary to discover, develop, and produce oil and gas on the Alaska OCS and to transport it from the production site.
MMS is looking for extensive experience working for, consulting for, or studying/ analyzing oil and gas activities in Alaska, especially in regard to activities that generate high levels of spending and to how they might be extrapolated to the nascent Alaska OCS oil and gas industry.  An understanding of supply and support systems/companies would be helpful..
3. Experience working with offshore oil and gas industry expenditure/cost data and data sources.
MMS is looking for guidance on the best ways to obtain data as to how much a company is likely to spend on a particular activity (e.g., drilling an exploratory well or fabricating and installing a platform), the sectors that supply the required goods and services, and the onshore geographic locations that supply those goods and services.  The heart of this qualification is the ability to provide advice as to actual sources of valid and obtainable expenditure/cost data to update and improve current data; therefore, MMS assumes that someone meeting this qualification would know how to obtain industry data directly and/or would have a thorough knowledge of commercially available data from FieldPlan, Ziff Energy, Douglas-Westwood, or other such sources.
4. Experience developing and applying regional economic impact models and experience with advanced applications of input-output (IO) software-data systems such as IMPLAN.
MMS is looking for experience examining the economic impacts of a complex industry at the local, regional, and national level and with adapting IO models to more complex issues, such as creating a spending profile for a "new" industry that is constructed of various existing sectors.  While this IO experience takes precedence, MAG-PLAN was developed on the Microsoft Access platform - with some Visual Basic coding, and MMS is hoping to include someone who can provide guidance on improving model efficiency.  
STATEMENT OF WORKGeography - MAG-PLAN GOM provides regional economic impact data estimated to reflect likely effects of proposed OCS oil and gas activities in three "planning areas":  the Western GOM, the Central GOM, and the Eastern GOM.  These regional economic effects are estimated for primary OSAs, or impact areas, that comprise 13 groups of counties and parishes that cover the entire GOM coast from southern Texas to southern Florida.  MAG-PLAN GOM provides more highly aggregated estimates for the remainder of the five GOM States and for the remainder of the United States. 
MAG-PLAN AK provides regional economic impact information to reflect onshore effects of OCS oil and gas activities in eight Alaska Offshore Modeling Areas.  A significant part of the data was collected from two previous MMS models, called Arctic and Sub-Arctic IMPAK.  These models were built for MMS by contractors using detailed engineering cost estimates for possible oil and gas activities on the Alaska OCS. 
Tasks - For each of the following tasks, member participation will be primarily in the form of written reviews and/or teleconferences.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS) intends to award a time and materials type sole source contract in the amount of $159,000 to Fekete Associates, Inc in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2),  only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements
The Minerals Management Service (MMS) has developed the first detailed data-intensive assessment of the potential quantity of methane gas hydrates on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  A spatially-enabled, stochastic assessment model has been developed to estimate potential in-place quantities of hydrates.  The next phase is to refine the in-place model to consider potential development technologies and reservoir engineering concepts to allow for an assessment of technically-recoverable gas hydrates resource on the OCS.  Fekete Associates have been involved in many of the early decision forums sponsored by the MMS, where proposed methodologies for a technically-recoverable approach have been weighed against that information which is currently available from the MMS in-place model.  This familiarity with the MMS existing model throughputs and outputs is a necessary qualification for the next phase.  Fekete Associates have published a widely accepted approach to evaluating type 1 reservoirs, which will allow a transition into the MMS model at substantial savings to MMS.  Additionally, Fekete Associates have access to sophisticated numerical simulation models that will provide the recovery factors for Type II and III reservoirs.  A cohesive and consistent approach to all three Types of reservoirs is desired to mitigate coding requirements as these products are incorporated in the MMS existing in-place model.

<DESC>Please read this notice carefully as it constitutes the only notice that will be issued.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15.  The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award a Firm Fixed Price contract entitled Workshop on the Status and Applications for Acoustic Marine Mammals.  The Minerals Management Service, Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.   The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541690-Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services.  The contractor must be capable of performing all of the tasks described below.  The period of performance of the resultant contract is anticipated to be not more than 18 months, with an estimated cost range between $170,000 - $190,000.  Background-Project Description:  Under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), marine mammals are given particular legal status.  The potential impacts of seismic and other noise-producing activities are subject to thorough review by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) and the Minerals Management Service (MMS).  Oil and gas exploration, sand and gravel resource assessment, future offshore wind turbine placement, and other alternative energy projects may include noise-producing operations.  Any potential impacts that MMS-regulated activities may have on these populations are significant program concerns and require mitigation and monitoring under the ESA and the MMPA.  Although a variety of monitoring tools are currently employed, the most promising tool to date is acoustic monitoring.  Both passive and active acoustic monitoring systems are currently available and in use for a variety of applications.  Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) for marine mammals has been used for several years with varying degrees of success.  PAM uses hydrophones in the water to detect vocalizations or other sounds that indicate the presence of animals.  Continuing development of both hardware and software for PAM has resulted in a choice of systems and a great deal of confusion and misinformation on system capabilities and requirements.  The MMS and other Federal agencies are increasingly relying on PAM to meet monitoring needs.  Active Acoustic Monitoring (AAM) is another method of determining the presence of marine mammals and other animals.  Sonar is actively used to locate animals, thus, unlike PAM, non-vocalizing marine mammals are detectable with AAM.  Different species can require multiple frequency bands and species identification has been a hurdle when using AAM.  The requirement to add sound to the ocean with AAM has presented environmental and regulatory problems.  However, systems are becoming more accurate with less noise output.  Units similar to the very ubiquitous fish finders found on many vessels are proving useful in some cases for marine mammal monitoring.  Both PAM and AAM systems have been technologically improved and many of the previous limitations of the systems are becoming less of a hindrance.  Generally, acoustic monitoring is not considered a stand-alone monitoring method, but rather may be a valuable tool to use in a suite of mitigation and monitoring techniques.  Acoustic monitoring has also become an important and even critical tool when monitoring in conditions where visibility is limited (i.e., night time, inclement weather).  Given the need for marine mammal monitoring and the misinformation and/or lack of unbiased information on available and developing acoustic monitoring systems, MMS plans to conduct a workshop on the Status and Applications for Acoustic Monitoring of Marine Mammals.  The broadly-stated purpose of the workshop will be to facilitate an informed understanding of the capabilities, applicability, and availability of current acoustic monitoring systems, the potential developments and improvements in future acoustic monitoring systems, and ways in which industry, MMS, and other regulatory agencies could use acoustic monitoring as a required monitoring tool.  A thorough examination of hardware and software available, the capabilities and limitations of the systems, the requirements for operation and use, the current and future applications to offshore industries and the potential impact of system reliability on industry and the marine animals will allow MMS as well as other regulatory agencies to determine the usefulness and appropriateness of PAM and AAM for a variety of mitigation and monitoring situations.  The latest monitoring technology will also be discussed and the current regulatory position on AAM will be examined.The objectives of the Status and Applications for Acoustic Monitoring of Marine Mammals Workshop are to:  identify available software and hardware systems and their uses and limitations;  review recent developments in acoustic monitoring technology and equipment;evaluate effectiveness of PAM and AAM for detecting marine mammals and assessing potential impacts;  evaluate industry cost and other liabilities of incorporating acoustic monitoring; andprovide MMS, other federal agencies, and industry with guidance on the applicability, feasibility and usefulness of these technologies as monitoring tools.  As a secondary objective and as time allows in the agenda, this workshop will also briefly examine other emerging marine mammal monitoring technologies currently available or in development (e.g., radar, unmanned aerial aircraft).  The workshop will be held at an appropriate location to be determined by mutual agreement between MMS and the contractor.  The selected location should not typically be subject to weather-related travel delays at the time of the workshop.  The study consists of four (4) main tasks:  Task 1:  Identification of key issues and personnel; Task 2:  Planning and coordination of the workshop; Task 3:  Conducting the workshop; and Task 4:  Preparation of the proceedings.  How to Respond: If you are interested in participating in this acquisition, please e-mail your organizations name, point of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers, e-mail address and DUNS Number not later than 2:00 p.m. E.T., October 23, 2008, to debra.bridge@mms.gov., or send this same information to Debra Bridge, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS-2101, Herndon, VA  20170.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents other than Human Immunodeficiency Virus. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics, which is funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.  Developing and testing new vaccines and therapies have historically been a major focus of the research supported by the DMID.  Much of this research is devoted to addressing critical public health needs, such as those related to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (e.g., avian influenza and West Nile Virus), as well as those supporting the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic candidates against potential agents of bioterrorism, including NIAID priority biodefense pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/bandc_priority.htm).
In August 2000, NIAID awarded a contract to provide a wide variety of regulatory support services for DMID clinical research activities, including clinical site monitoring, management and preparation of regulatory files, and management and operation of a clinical agent and clinical specimen repository.  This contract provides for the establishment and operation of a Clinical Agent and Specimen Repository (CASR) that adheres to current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP), Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) for the acquisition, receipt, storage and shipping of clinical agents and clinical specimens in support of DMID sponsored clinical trials and research programs in the U.S. and abroad.  Regulatory support services are currently being recompeted through a separate contract solicitation.

Clinical agents include study products (drugs, vaccines, and therapeutics), commercial products, placebos, syringes, and other protocol-mandated supplies to be used in DMID-sponsored clinical trials.  For the purposes of this contract, other protocol-mandated supplies include electronic adherence measuring devices and associated devices for downloading data, thermometers, oral syringes, adaptors for transferring liquids from bottles to syringes, syringes for injection, and pregnancy test kits. Clinical specimens include sera or other protocol-mandated specimens obtained from DMID-funded clinical research sites, to be distributed to DMID approved testing laboratories for analysis.  The current DMID Regulatory Affairs Support contractor will provide the Contractor with the existing DMID-owned Clinical Agent Repository Inventory Management (CARIM) Database System. The CARIM database is used in conjunction with the DMID owned regulatory affairs support Human Subjects Research Oversight and Accountability Database (HSROAD) which has an electronic ordering module.    
Currently both databases are being managed by the DMID Regulatory Affairs Support contractor.  

Potential sources must demonstrate and document the following in their capability statements: 1) Receipt, appropriate storage, monitoring, distribution and disposition of clinical agents from product suppliers in support of DMID-sponsored clinical research 2) Labeling, packaging and repacking of clinical agents for distribution to DMID-funded clinical research sites and DMID approved testing laboratories 3) Receipt of all required shipping documents 4) Validation of packaging and shipping procedures for the shipment of clinical agents under correct temperature conditions 5) Monitoring of product inventories and expiration dates 6) Acquisition of clinical agents and non-clinical testing 7) Receipt, short-term storage (two-years), monitoring, distribution, and disposition of clinical specimens in support of DMID sponsored clinical research 8) Aliquoting, labeling, of clinical specimens for distribution to DMID approved testing laboratories 9) Maintenance and operation of an electronic system for requesting services and tracking agents and specimens.  There will be three options under this acquisition:

Option 1: The Contractor shall increase clinical specimen capacity of the CASR in order to accommodate the following:
	-80oC (approximately 1600 cu. ft.)
	-20oC (approximately 1600 cu. ft.)
Option 2: The Contractor shall increase the length of time for the storage of clinical specimens in the CASR to exceed the short-term storage requirement of two (2) years as specified in the base requirement, to provide for storage until the end of the contract period of performance.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM), Washington, DC is seeking Architect or architect/engineer (NAICS 541310) firm capable of preparing all design documentation including, but not limited to, advance/master planning and design of long term care medical facility in the Canandaigua, New York area.The prime contractor should have, at least, the following licensed/registered specialty disciplines as members of the firm, or team, with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields: Architects; Medical Planners; Structural, Seismic, Mechanical, Geo-technical, Communication, and Electrical Engineers; Interior Designers; an independent Commissioning Agent; and Cost Estimators with experience in the planning and design of hospitals, large medical and significant outpatient/ambulatory care clinics, or similar complex healthcare projects including long term care inclusive of both new construction and renovation.Probable Scope:  VA proposes to construct a new long term care facility to include 120 nursing home beds, gero-psychiatric services and hospice care (approx. 130,000 GSF), and 50 domiciliary beds and residential rehab services (approx. 32,000 GSF). Selective building demolition and renovation of the existing 70+ year old medical campus will be necessary. An alternative to renovating more of the existing buildings is to construct a new Outpatient Clinic.

<DESC>*******Please note that the synopsis for this requirement was posted 20 Aug 08 under the same solicitation number; however, it was posted under the incorrect Contracting Office. Due to the fact that this has been posted over 30 days, the CO has determined that the FAR 5 requirement has been met and is issuing the solicitation.********

Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. §2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority. Contract term is anticipated at 50 years. 

The following is a brief description of the system to be privatized:

The Westover ARB natural gas distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts at the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Access. The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system.  There are no items specifically excluded from the natural gas distribution system privatization.
Natural gas is supplied to Westover ARB by Bay State Gas through two metering points. One metering point is near the Central Ave. Gate (Building 2765). A second metering point is at the Westover Club. The meters are owned by Bay State Gas. The main distribution system receives gas at approximately 50 pounds per square inch gauge (PSIG). Natural gas is used to meet space and water heating requirements on Base. The natural gas utility system at Westover ARB has no pressure problems during peak winter loads. Bay State Gas maintains odorization at the metering points. 
A study of the capacity of the natural gas system at Westover ARB to support future operations when BRAC related mission additions are complete was finalized in February 2008.  This study concluded that the proposed capital projects represent a potential increase in peak gas flow of about 76 percent compared to the existing theoretical peak flow, and that several modifications were recommended to allow the existing system to accommodate the increased demand.   
The natural gas utility system at Westover ARB consists of polyethylene (PE) pipe that is owned by Westover ARB. Natural gas utility mains and service lines are approximately 3 to 6 feet below grade.   Valves are also made of plastic.  Some of the pipe is buried with marker tape and tracer wire, but a majority of the system does not have marker tape or functioning tracer wire because it was installed using jack and bore techniques.
 The distribution system is looped so that most buildings can be fed from at least two different paths. There are no cathodic protection or odorization facilities at Westover ARB.  A short segment of metal pipe delivers natural gas to the west side of building 3505 on the north side of the base.  This pipe does not have cathodic protection so it is being programmed for replacement.

<DESC>Nashua National Fish Hatchery Raceway Covers
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation for this work and this solicitation is a request for proposals.  The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 5 has a requirement for Raceway Covers for the Nashua National Fish Hatchery located in Nashua, New Hampshire.  Enclosing the raceways is necessary to reduce the risk of future fish disease outbreaks at the hatchery.  Enclosed raceways will reduce pathogen transmission risks associated with bird and mammal predation.  Bird predators such as ducks, geese, gulls, heron, and songbirds are seen to pose the greatest risk of transmitting disease.  Mammal predators, such as mink, otter, raccoons, groundhogs, opossum, and deer also pose a risk of transmitting disease.
The existing concrete raceways were constructed in pairs.  Each pair of raceways is approximately 18'-8" wide by 100' long.  There are ten pairs of existing raceways.  Some of the raceways incorporate a slight curve (see attached drawing).  This curve must be taken into consideration when designing the structure.  Each raceway section is currently covered with a raceway cover.  The cost of removing and disposing of the existing raceway enclosures must be included within your proposal within the base bid and in each of the subsequent additive items.
Each raceway section should have a minimum height at the center of the structure of 10'-6".  The furthest western end panel should wrap around an approximate 14" water supply pipe.  Each raceway section should include a securable and lockable personnel door on each of the ends (short side) of the structure and should have two securable and lockable side entries on each long side of the raceway (total of four entries).  These entries should be located at the far ends of the structure.  A personnel door is not required on the end of the structure with the approximate 14" water supply line penetration.  Access over the raceways between the fourth and fifth set of raceways must be maintained.  The existing alarm system wiring within the structures will be removed and replaced by the Government.  No electrical or lighting work is required.  There will be water and fish within the raceways when the work is being performed.  Extreme care should be taken to prevent foreign objects from falling into the raceways.  The salmon have not been exposed to direct sun light during their life and are extremely susceptible to sunburn.  Because of the sunburn potential, exposure time must be minimal, and the removal and replacement process will need to be coordinated with, and approved by the hatchery manager. 
To safeguard the structure(s) against potential disease outbreaks, the interior sidewalls of each structure may require disinfectant.  For this reason, wood cannot be used in the structure.  The structure must be attached to the top of the existing 8" wide raceway walls. Additional foundations to support the new structure cannot be placed beside the raceways because of the proximity of underground drain pipes that run adjacent to the raceways.  Each enclosure should be assembled with a corrosion resistant steel or aluminum frame and vinyl fabric covering, or as a pre-engineered metal building.  The enclosure should be available in a choice of colors and should be capable of transmitting some natural light into the enclosed space.  Enclosure fabric/skin cannot be translucent/clear, but must be capable of transmitting sufficient subdued light into the enclosed space to allow the hatchery staff to operate the fish production raceways during day time hours.  The structure(s) must be rated for the snow and wind loading conditions in the Nashua, New Hampshire area.
Proposals should provide manufacturer's information which thoroughly describes the items and features being proposed, and any warranty information.  Also, identify any items or features that would be need to be completed by other contracts or companies. Prospective contractors are encouraged to inspect the hatchery site prior to submitting a proposal.  The site can be inspected by contacting Kyle Flanery, Hatchery Manager at (603) 595-0891.  Please submit all information (including proposed costs, terms, and conditions) to Lisa Virgilio, USFWS, 300 Westgate Center Drive, Hadley, MA 01035. All proposals will be evaluated by price, technical requirements, and quality of product; and a best value determination will be made.

<DESC>According to the latest Defense Science Board Energy Report dated February 2008, for Army operations, “during wartime, generators become the largest single fuel consumers on the battlefield”. A high efficiency, advanced power generation unit suitable for both Army and Marine Corp applications could help reduce the battle space fuel burden and help meet the ever increasing power demands for our troops in the battlefield.

The objective of this program is to obtain detailed designs for a modular, compact, high temperature fuel cell system to provide high efficiency, silent power for US Marine Corps (USMC) and other DoD Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) applications. The Office of Naval Research desires to gather and evaluate detailed designs for a Solid Oxide based high temperature fuel cell system with or without compatible energy recovery machinery that can perform the function of an APU capable of operating with JP5, JP8, Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel, and zero sulfur synthetic diesel. The fuel cell based APU system design must account for full militarized specifications associated with existing fielded APU systems.  The system should be able to achieve TRL 6 by January 2012 with capability of TRL9 by 2015.  

The attached presentations for this BAA announcement were presented during the Industry Day that was previously posted.  Any questions with regards to these technical presentations should directed to the Program Officer.

<p>In accordance with DFARS clause 252-232-7003, entitled "Electronic Submission of Payment Requests," the Department of Defense (DoD) has implemented a new electronic invoicing system, known as Wide Area Work Flow - Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA), which is designed to automate and expedite commercial invoices and government receiving reports by electronically processing these items. WAWF-RA will simplify your Government invoicing process, allow you to monitor you payment status online, and ensure faster payment transactions for your company. WAWF-RA is a web-based program and is available at no cost to your company. For assistance with WAWF, please call 1-866-618-5988. To register your company for WAWF, simply log into https://wawf.eb.mil. Step-by-step instructions on how to register and how to submit invoices through WAWF-RA are outlined at https://rmb.ogden.disa.mil. There is a training web site that provides hands-on training in a non-production environment at the following link https://wawftraining.eb.mil.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Be advised that all interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database in order to receive an award. If you are not registered you may request an application at (888) 227-2423 or through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov.<br />You will also need to update your Centralized Contractor Registration (CCR) account with your Electronic Business Point of Contact (EBPOC).

There is not power or electricity so if you want to work during other than the daylight hours that is fine. Just be sure to notify us of your work schedule, days and time. Vendor must provide own power generation and illumination if working during periods of limited visibility.<BR>Q: 7) Who makes the decision on the type of plants? <BR>A: 7) It varies. The desert grass can be anything to make clutter. The assorted shrubs can be anything viable. Flowers are okay, but nothing that will create species. No Oleanders please. <BR>Q: 8) What are is the minimum height of the palm trees?<BR>A: 8) Minimum is 7 feet from the ground level to the bottom of the branches.  Anything smaller will not be accepted.<BR>Q: 9) When and where will the inspection of the plants take place?<BR>A: 9) The inspection will take place onsite but before the plants are in the ground. The size of the bulb as well as the rest of the plant needs to be visible. The acceptable minimum height of the palms will be verified then by meassuring the projected ground level mark above the root ball to the bottom of the branches at the trunk. <BR>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:<BR>1) Plants shrubs and grasses shall have warranty for one year.  Warranty is<BR>intended to replace items that fail to establish and become viable items.<BR>Warranty is not required on damages resulting from the direct effects from<BR>vehicle traffic or foot traffic cased by others (other than the vendor). <BR>2) All trees, plants, shrubs and desert grass plantings must have adequate<BR>water delivery to insure viability.<BR>3) Vendor is responsible to untie palms branches at a future agreeable date<BR>best suited for plant viability.  <BR>4) Vendor is required to use planting techniques and/or anchoring to<BR>mitigate wind effects while the plant is established.  <BR>5) No photographic equipment or picture taking is allowed on the jobsite.<BR>Personnel with camera imbedded cell phones must sign and agreement not to<BR>take photos.  <BR>6)We preferred company employees to be naturalized or U.S. citizens to work here. But, that is not possible so we do have restrictions imposed on them. They can work on the Main Administrative Area (MAA) without an escort as long they have a green card or naturalized. If they will be working on the ranges and/or mission side, the company will have to submit a visit request letter addressed to foreign disclosure officer and they will be escorted at all times. The person is escorting them will have to take the foreign escort training.<BR>

The solicitation number is F6J0BAFY20081 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  Offerors shall consider any language or terminology contained herein, through inclusion by a clause or provision, or communication, to be that which is related to the type of solicitation indicated in this paragraph (e.g. quote versus offer, proposal, or bid).<BR><BR>iii.	The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26. <BR><BR>iv.	This notice is unrestricted. The associated NAICS code is 451140 and small business size standard is $7,000,000.  The Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program does not apply for this acquisition. <BR><BR>v.	Request quote on the following item(s) and quantity(s):  In order to ensure the highest degree of understanding the Government will issue the equipment listing via email by means of spreadsheet, versus inclusion in to this document which is displayed as plain text.

As such, the Government may award a contract for a portion of the items listed should it represent the overall Best Value to the Government.<BR><BR>In the course of evaluating quotes, the Government may elect to utilize tradeoffs among price and non-price factors.  The purpose of such tradeoffs is to allow the Government to obtain the most advantageous mix of Price and Mission Capability.  If in the event the Government cannot obtain both by means of a single quote, it will determine if it is more advantageous to go with a higher priced quote with a higher degree of capability, or a lower priced quote with a lower degree of capability. <BR><BR>x.	Applicable - Offerors shall include a copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, and FAR 52.219-1 (Alt I), Small Business Program Representations, with their quote.

<DESC>N65236-08-R-0210-0003- 25 September 2008The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions. Any questionssubmitted after the posting of this amendment may not be answered.  Thehour and date specified for receipt of offer is hereby extended to 29September 2008 at 10:00 AM EST.  Offeror must acknowledge receipt of thisamendment prior to the offer due date listed herein in writing.  A simplestatement acknowledging receipt of amendment 0003 is sufficient.1. Question: Are you specifying a connector with pins as opposed to sockets,i.e., a DE-9P, and that has female type locking screws?Answer:  There are no pins in the DB-9/DE-9.  The government requires thefemale type locking screws.  The Government does not understand theconfusion.  The specification states under 4.1.1- "jackscrews with female typeends, standoffs threaded, spacing (NSN: 5340-01-522-1658)".  A picture of the9-pin connector is posted to the e-commerce site.2. On page 1 of the drawing, note 4.1.3 indicates that the cable should exittoward the bottom of the radio. It appears that the Harris version of the C-600connector exits toward the bottom which would cause interference. Can weassume that Note 4.1.3 is in error?Answer: Paragraph 4.1.3 on Page 1 of the drawing on the e-commerce sitestating "Cable shall be designed to flow towards the bottom of the radio, notthe top, after connector "B" is connected to the radio" is the requirement.Thisis not an error.3. How many cables are currently connecting the radio to the TOCNET system?What are the part numbers for those cables?Answer: One cable currently connects the radio to the TOCNET System.  It is theSPAWAR W5007-1 Cable.  There is not a commercial part number for thatcable.  The interface to the existing cable is via the DB-9/DE-9 connector. TheSPAWAR W5007-1 cable will be connected to the cable assembly procuredunder this solicitation.  The Harris part number for the cable assembly beingprocured under this solicitation is 12041-72320-A18.4. Will vendors that offer a 32pin connector with dimensions greater than thosespecified in section 2.2.2 on page 1 of the drawing pass the technicalevaluation?Answer: Vendors will be evaluated on their compliance with the specifieddrawing, as well as, the function of their cable.Posted picture of 9-pin connector-24 September 2008N65236-08-R-0210-0002- 23 September 2008The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions, update drawing for rev2 and provide clarification for other issues.Questions:1)The end "A" connector described on the drawing specification, para. 4.1.1,states a DB-9F, which is a 25-pin connector. The required 9-pin connectorshould be a DE-9S or DE-9P.Response: This was a typo.  Paragraph 4.1.1 should state DE-9F ( where F isfor Female). We need the 9-pin connector.  See http://www.nullmodem.com/DB-9.htm.  The "DB-9F" is not a 25 pin connector.  It is the Government'sunderstanding that the 9 stands for the number of pins.2)The solicitation spec and para. 4.1.1 of the drawing both state jackscrewswithfemale type ends while the drawing shows jack posts.Response: The drawing shows jackscrews with a female type (as stated in thespecs and para. 4.1.1).  Jack posts are not required.3)The specification states that the cable shall flow toward the bottom of theradio, yet the drawing spec shows pin 29 of the 32-pin connector located in away that would cause the cable to flow toward the top of the radio, since pin29is next to the connector key which is toward the top of the radio.Response:  The connector on our drawing should show pins 29 and 32 locatednext to the connector key.4) Please provide a cable assembly in order to create a schematic.Response: The Government does not have a cable assembly available.  This isthe first time these assemblies have been purchased.  We currently haveradios in theater without the appropriate cable.5)Please provide Ohmmeter readings for the pins.Response: Please contact the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) forOhmeter readings of the radio. The radio is a type 1 encrypted device.SPAWAR does not have the authority to release proprietary data about theradios.6) The gauge size of the cable used is 28 gauge.  Can you please advise why20 gauge is being specified?Response: The 20 gauge is correct.  For this cable, the government requires 20gauge cable.7) Do we have a part number for the cable.Response: No.8) What is the purpose of the contract number listed on bottom right of thecable specs documentResponse:  Disregard.  The contract number is not applicable to thisprocurement.The hour and date specified for receipt of offer remains 26 September 2008 at2:00 PM.  Offeror must acknowledge receipt of this amendment prior to theoffer due date listed herein in writing.  A simple statement acknowledgingreceipt of amendment 0002 is sufficient.N65236-08-R-0210-0001- 22 September 2008The purpose of this amendment is to revise the solicitation specifications anddrawing, request a product sample of the cable, and answer questions.1.  The detailed specifications and drawing are revised as attached (DATA-REMOTE CONTROL CAB Rev 1.pdf).  Disregard all other drawings andspecifications.2. Under the "Additional Specifications" listed in the combinedsynopsis/solicitation, the cable length shall be 18 inches (shielded) insteadof12 inches.3. A product sample shall be delivered to Tiffany Boatwright in care of NancyStraight, Code 5.3.1.5.0, SPAWARSYSCEN Charleston, 1639 Avenue B North,North Charleston, SC  29405-1639 no later than 26 September 2008.  Thetracking number for this sample shall be sent along with your proposal no laterthan 2:00 PM EST on 26 September 2008. The Government will not pay anyshipping costs related to the submission of the sample.  The product sampleshall be tested by the Government to determine technical acceptability.4. Questions and Answers  Question A. The cable length shall be 12 inches.  What is the (wire)gauge of that?Answer A: The cable should be 18" long, and 20 gaugeQuestion B:  Under 4.1.2, End B connector- Who is the manufacturer?Answer B: End B connector- Harris and AMTI are the only manufacturers knownby the Government. End A, the DB-9, is a common connector made by manymanufacturers.5. The hour and date specified for receipt of offer is hereby extended to 26September 2008 at 2:00 PM.  Offeror must acknowledge receipt of thisamendment prior to the offer due date listed herein in writing.  A simplestatement acknowledging receipt of amendment 0001 is sufficient.Drawing and Specifications attached-17 September 2008This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared inaccordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented withadditional information included in this notice.

Can weassume that Note 4.1.3 is in error?Answer: Paragraph 4.1.3 on Page 1 of the drawing on the e-commerce sitestating "Cable shall be designed to flow towards the bottom of the radio, notthe top, after connector "B" is connected to the radio" is the requirement.Thisis not an error.3. How many cables are currently connecting the radio to the TOCNET system?What are the part numbers for those cables?Answer: One cable currently connects the radio to the TOCNET System.  It is theSPAWAR W5007-1 Cable.  There is not a commercial part number for thatcable.  The interface to the existing cable is via the DB-9/DE-9 connector. TheSPAWAR W5007-1 cable will be connected to the cable assembly procuredunder this solicitation.  The Harris part number for the cable assembly beingprocured under this solicitation is 12041-72320-A18.4. Will vendors that offer a 32pin connector with dimensions greater than thosespecified in section 2.2.2 on page 1 of the drawing pass the technicalevaluation?Answer: Vendors will be evaluated on their compliance with the specifieddrawing, as well as, the function of their cable.Posted picture of 9-pin connector-24 September 2008N65236-08-R-0210-0002- 23 September 2008The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions, update drawing for rev2 and provide clarification for other issues.Questions:1)The end "A" connector described on the drawing specification, para. 4.1.1,states a DB-9F, which is a 25-pin connector. The required 9-pin connectorshould be a DE-9S or DE-9P.Response: This was a typo.  Paragraph 4.1.1 should state DE-9F ( where F isfor Female). We need the 9-pin connector.  See http://www.nullmodem.com/DB-9.htm.  The "DB-9F" is not a 25 pin connector.  It is the Government'sunderstanding that the 9 stands for the number of pins.2)The solicitation spec and para. 4.1.1 of the drawing both state jackscrewswithfemale type ends while the drawing shows jack posts.Response: The drawing shows jackscrews with a female type (as stated in thespecs and para. 4.1.1).  Jack posts are not required.3)The specification states that the cable shall flow toward the bottom of theradio, yet the drawing spec shows pin 29 of the 32-pin connector located in away that would cause the cable to flow toward the top of the radio, since pin29is next to the connector key which is toward the top of the radio.Response:  The connector on our drawing should show pins 29 and 32 locatednext to the connector key.4) Please provide a cable assembly in order to create a schematic.Response: The Government does not have a cable assembly available.  This isthe first time these assemblies have been purchased.  We currently haveradios in theater without the appropriate cable.5)Please provide Ohmmeter readings for the pins.Response: Please contact the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) forOhmeter readings of the radio. The radio is a type 1 encrypted device.SPAWAR does not have the authority to release proprietary data about theradios.6) The gauge size of the cable used is 28 gauge.  Can you please advise why20 gauge is being specified?Response: The 20 gauge is correct.  For this cable, the government requires 20gauge cable.7) Do we have a part number for the cable.Response: No.8) What is the purpose of the contract number listed on bottom right of thecable specs documentResponse:  Disregard.  The contract number is not applicable to thisprocurement.The hour and date specified for receipt of offer remains 26 September 2008 at2:00 PM.  Offeror must acknowledge receipt of this amendment prior to theoffer due date listed herein in writing.

Questions and Answers  Question A. The cable length shall be 12 inches.  What is the (wire)gauge of that?Answer A: The cable should be 18" long, and 20 gaugeQuestion B:  Under 4.1.2, End B connector- Who is the manufacturer?Answer B: End B connector- Harris and AMTI are the only manufacturers knownby the Government. End A, the DB-9, is a common connector made by manymanufacturers.5. The hour and date specified for receipt of offer is hereby extended to 26September 2008 at 2:00 PM.

<p>Title/Subject: INFORMATION SUPPORT SERVER ENVIRONMENT (ISSE) GUARD II</p>
<p>Response Date: 09 OCT 2008</p>
<p>Primary Point of Contact: Joseph Austin, AFRL/RIKE, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514, Email: Joseph.Austin@rl.af.mil, (315) 330-4310</p>
<p>Solicitation Number: FA8750-09-R-0002</p>
<p>A Sources Sought Notice was released by The Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site (AFRL Rome) on 01 JUL 2008 under both classification codes A, Research and Development, and R, Professional, administrative, and management support services, entitled "INFORMATION SUPPORT SERVER ENVIRONMENT (ISSE) Research &amp; Development " and "INFORMATION SUPPORT SERVER ENVIRONMENT (ISSE) GUARD Professional, Administrative, and Management Support Services" respectively. The NAICS code for the sources sought was 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services, with a size standard of annual average receipts of $23 million. Since the Sources Sought notification, a pre-solicitation was posted entitled, "INFORMATION SUPPORT SERVER ENVIRONMENT (ISSE) GUARD II" under the R, Professional, Administrative, and Management Support Services, classification, dated 21 AUG 2008.</p>
<p>The objective of this posting is to rescind the pre-solicitation notice dated 21 AUG 2008, and modify the established NAICS code to 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), with a size standard of 500 employees. Additionally, capable sources, who have not already provided a capabilities package, are sought to perform software research, development, and implementation for the AFRL/RIE Division, Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site, Rome NY (AFRL Rome).</p>
<p>AFRL Rome has a requirement to conduct Information Support Server Environment (ISSE) Guard software enhancement, implementation, system integration, installation, operation and maintenance, research and development, and support for the Air Force Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Agency's Combat ISR Office, the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Federal Law Enforcement Agencies, and existing ISSE user sites. This effort supports Air Force efforts in providing commands with required Cross-Domain ISR information and capability, when and where it is needed. This Inter-domain information sharing program will enhance the current ISSE Guard at the Unified and Major Commands and their subordinate units and maintain the current ISSE Guard sites. Software development, integration, deployment and maintenance will be provided for the ISSE Guard. It will be necessary to provide analysis, design, development, integration management, system and network administration/operation, technical documentation and testing to support the maintenance and evaluation of existing systems and of new development systems. In the course of performance, the support personnel will interface with various agencies<br />and commands throughout the DoD through electronic means and visits to various DoD and U.S. Intelligence Community sites worldwide. The support personnel will also provide technical support to AFRL/RIE to assist in the<br />analysis, design, development, integration, testing and evaluation. Anticipated deliverables include software and technical documentation.</p>
<p>This work will require a source that maintains a SECRET facility clearance and staff with TOP SECRET / SCI security clearances. An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity cost-plus-fixed-fee (completion) type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of 60 months.</p>

The same considerations would apply to any HBCU/MI set-aside. Therefore, respondents should provide a statement of capabilities and information demonstrating management and technical experience on similar acquisitions and resources necessary to successfully compete for this award (See Numbered Note 25). This information will assist the Air Force in making a set-aside decision.</p>
<p>Respondents must demonstrate knowledge and expertise in the following areas: Multi-Level security technologies, Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) processes for both the Top Secret and Below Interoperability (TSABI) and<br />Secret and Below Interoperability (SABI) communities, the DoDIIS Integrator's Guide (DIG), general knowledge of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and applicability to a cross domain environment, Unified Cross Domain Management Office (UCDMO) and DoDIIS Cross Domain Management Office (DCDMO) policies, applicable cross domain security requirements including Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Instruction No. 1253 Security Control Catalog for National Security Systems, general knowledge of the DoD unique Guarding requirements, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)/Full Service Directories (FSD).</p>

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION EXTENDS THE SUSPENSE DATE FOR THE SOC SUBMISSION TO FRIDAY, 11 JANUARY 2008
The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW) intends to release a solicitation to acquire Command and Control System-Consolidated (CCS-C) Block 2 upgrades in support of Transformational Satellite Communications (TSAT) S-Band operations, Wideband Global SATCOM  (WGS) Block 2 satellites, and other MILSATCOM programs.  In addition, CCS-C architecture extensions will support NetCentric command and control and Information Assurance requirements identified by Headquarters Air Force Space Command will be supported. The CCS-C development and deployment will support the launch, on-orbit operations, and anomaly resolution of the TSAT satellites from its command and control system through the AFSCN (Air Force Satellite Control Network). CCS-C capabilities include: activity planning; telemetry processing; commanding; orbit management; resource management; space vehicle and ground system simulation; support planning and execution; and interfaces with dedicated ground and payload control systems.  Satellite platform and payload state-of-health operations include launch, early-orbit, on-orbit, anomaly resolution, and disposal operations.  Future migration to USB (Unified S-Band) waveforms and data formats shall be supported.  Contractor must be able to sustain existing CCS-C hardware, software, databases, and command procedures.  Continuing upgrades to address Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) hardware and software obsolescence are anticipated.  

The period of performance is anticipated to be for 10 years and will begin in FY09 lasting through FY19. This is a follow-on effort to the existing CCS-C development, procurement and support contract currently performed by Integral Systems Inc. (ISI), 5000 Philadelphia Way, Lanham, MD 20706-4417.  The projected Request for Proposal (RFP) release date for this effort is October 2008.  On-site locations include but are not limited to Schriever AFB, CO and Vandenberg AFB, CA.  A minimum DoD security clearance of Secret is mandatory for all personnel supporting this effort.  

Interested Contractors must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) by 5:00 pm (Pacific) on Friday, 11 January 2008 demonstrating knowledge of CCS-C hardware and software design and test procedures.  The submission must also include an assessment of actual, potential, or perceptions of Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) through the submission of an OCI Mitigation Plan.  The mitigation plan will be evaluated to ensure proper safeguards are implemented or will be implemented to protect the Government's interests and to identify perceptions of bias and unmitigable OCIs in accordance with FAR 9.5. OCIs can occur at any level; prime, subcontractor, or other types of teammates.  Additionally, there are two underlying principles of OCI; 1) conflicting roles that might bias or impair a contractor's judgment, and 2) unfair competitive advantage (where a competing contractor has access to proprietary information of a competitor(s) or has access to source selection information that is not available to all competitors). Negative replies are requested indicating no actual, potential, or perceptions of OCI were identified. The OCI plans must also be in compliance with the current version of the SMC OCI checklist, attached and also available upon request from the contracting officer, Herbert Countee. 

The SOC shall not exceed 20 one-sided pages in length.  This page limit is for the SOC only and does not include the required OCI Mitigation Plan submission  Response must be submitted by e-mail in electronic form in MS Word 2002 or higher or PDF Format.  All responses must conform to 8.5 by 11.0 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.  

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute an RFP.  Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of a SOC.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether any prospective credible source other then the incumbent exists.  Responses from qualified small and small disadvantaged small businesses are highly encouraged. Submit all responses to synopsis to: SMC/MCSW/PK, Attn: Mr Herbert B. Countee, 483 N. Aviation Blvd., Suite 1467-A8, Los Angeles Air Force Base, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808. Electronic submissions are acceptable and can be submitted to herb.countee@losangeles.af.mil. Inquiries may be directed to Mr. Countee at 310-653-9525.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), Regulatory Support Affairs contract will provide regulatory expertise, technical, and administrative support for DMID's clinical research programs.<br></br>
Research supported and conducted by the NIAID, NIH, DHHS, strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID, DMID supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents other than Human Immunodeficiency Virus. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics, which is funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.<br> 
</br>
Developing and testing new vaccines and therapies have historically been a major focus of the research supported by the DMID.  Much of this research is devoted to addressing critical public health needs, such as those related to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (e.g., avian influenza and West Nile Virus), as well as those supporting the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic candidates against potential agents of bioterrorism, including NIAID priority biodefense pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/bandc_priority.htm).<br>   
</br>
In order to ensure that the development, testing and manufacture of products evaluated under DMID-supported clinical research are executed with a rigor that will support licensure by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), DMID supports an infrastructure to provide regulatory assistance in the development and testing of these products.<br>  
</br>
Currently, DMID sponsors approximately 100 Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) or Master Files (MFs) which span more than 200 clinical trials.  This includes both multicenter trials and single center studies, and encompasses Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials performed at both domestic and foreign sites.  DMID files approximately 10-20 new INDs each year, and in this capacity, serves as the official IND sponsor and liaison with the FDA with respect to all regulatory requirements.  Currently, the DMID IND portfolio is comprised of approximately 75% vaccine and other biologic INDs (monoclonal), 20% drug INDs, and 5% MFs.  In addition, it is anticipated that Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) will be required during the contract period of performance.<br>
 </br>
It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a seven-year period of performance beginning on or about 
April 1, 2008.<br>  
</br>
Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about May 22, 2007 and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.
