<DESC>The purpose of this requirement is to provide the full complement of services required, including volunteers, qualified personnel, material, equipment and facilities in which to study the biology of influenza viruses in humans, to examine the host's immune response to these viruses, and to test and evaluate new candidate vaccines for safety, genetic stability, immunogenicity, transmissibility and protective efficacy in humans. Studies will also include the safe administration of wild-type virus to healthy adult volunteers in order to assess pathogenicity, virulence and their suitability for use as a challenge virus in efficacy studies. These wild-type viruses will be used to challenge vaccinated adult volunteers in order to assess the extent of immunity induced by candidate vaccines.
Studies will include both adult and pediatric subjects since influenza viruses cause severe respiratory disease in people of all ages. In summary, the requirement is to provide the necessary populations to study the biology and immunology of a variety of influenza viruses and serve as a testing center for the development of new vaccines effective against these agents.

NIAID intends to award a five-year contract with five (5) one-year options. This is not a Request for Proposals. The intention of this announcement is to notify potential offerors that the Request for Proposals will be available for download on or about April 4, 2008 from www.fedbizopps.gov. No hard copies will be distributed. All questions must be submitted in writing to Alexander Kramer (kramera@niaid.nih.gov).

<DESC><p>The government's request to publically post the Lockheed Martin F-22 maintenance stands drawings has been denied. Per Lockheed Martin's legal department, "...this data is considered Lockheed Martin Proprietary Information and therefore the drawings should not be posted...".</p>
<p><br />Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).</p>
<p><br />FAR 6.302-1(b)(2). The existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, or secret process' the control of basic raw material' or simliar circumstances, make the supplies and services available from only one source.</p>
<p><br />The government maintains the F-22 under a partnering agreeement with Lockheed Martin. The aircraft is classified and manufacturers of work stands for other aircraft types cannot obtain the data or access to the aircraft to develop stands. Lockheed Martin has granted 2 (two) small business sources authorization to manufacturer F-22 maintenance stands. The government has approved a limited sources competition per FAR 6.302-1. Competition will be limited to the approved Lockheed Martin sources.</p>

<DESC><p>In accordance with the partnering agreement between the Air Force and Lockheed Martin, Lockheed will provide the F-22 maintenance stands. OSHA has required the Air Force to comply with fall protection regulations by Oct 2009. The maintenance stands have only been built by Lockheed and its subcontractors. Lockheed cannot provide the F-22 maintenance stands in the timeframe required. Therefore, two small business contractors previously used by Lockheed to manufacturer stands were identified to have current access to Lockheed's proprietary data and to the classified aircraft. These two small businesses can provide the stands within the timeframe required allowing the Air Force to meet the OSHA schedule and safety requirements.
<p>For the reasons stated above, the government determined to post this on FedBizOpps as a limited sources solicitation. However if additional small business contractors submit a proposal the information will be accepted, considered, and listed in the contract file.</p>
<p>According to the solicitation two factors will be used to evaluate proposals. The first factor is price and the second is technical acceptability. These factors will be used in determining the best value to the government.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this requirement is to provide the full complement of services required, including volunteers, qualified personnel, material, equipment and facilities in which to study the biology of influenza viruses in humans, to examine the host's immune response to these viruses, and to test and evaluate new candidate vaccines for safety, genetic stability, immunogenicity, transmissibility and protective efficacy in humans. Studies will also include the safe administration of wild-type virus to healthy adult volunteers in order to assess pathogenicity, virulence and their suitability for use as a challenge virus in efficacy studies. These wild-type viruses will be used to challenge vaccinated adult volunteers in order to assess the extent of immunity induced by candidate vaccines.
Studies will include both adult and pediatric subjects since influenza viruses cause severe respiratory disease in people of all ages. In summary, the requirement is to provide the necessary populations to study the biology and immunology of a variety of influenza viruses and serve as a testing center for the development of new vaccines effective against these agents.

NIAID intends to award a five-year contract with five (5) one-year options. This is not a Request for Proposals. The intention of this announcement is to notify potential offerors that the Request for Proposals will be available for download on May 22, 2008 from www.fedbizopps.gov. No hard copies will be distributed. All questions must be submitted in writing to Alexander Kramer (kramera@niaid.nih.gov).
