<DESC>A synopsis was previously released under solicitation number BPD-06-R-0024 for Professional/Technical Services.  THE SOLICITATION NUMBER IS HEREBY CHANGED TO BPD-07-R-0014.  The requirement has not changed. 

On behalf of the Treasury Franchise Fund?s FedSource, the Bureau of the Public Debt intends to issue multiple-award, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), parallel solicitations to acquire the services of capable businesses to provide Project Support Solutions on a nationwide basis to multiple Federal agencies.  Details for the services will be outlined in the performance based work statement.  The Government intends to make multiple awards as a result of each of the solicitations for a base year and four option years.  Offers will be solicited from the small business community to include 8(a)s, HUBZones, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs), and small businesses; and on an unrestricted basis.  

Potential Offerors may propose on one or more of the five service groups listed below that comprise the overall Project Support Solution effort, which will be addressed in separate solicitations.  Multiple solicitations will be released by the Government, as indicated below, in order to make multiple awards to businesses in all business size and certified SBA disadvantaged business categories.  The 5 different service groups include Group 1 ? Administrative/Clerical and Light Industrial (NAICS 561110), Group 2 ? Scientific and Medical (NAICS 541710), Group 3 ? Engineering (541330), Group 4 ? Information Technology (541513), and Group 5 ? Professional/Technical (541990).  Each of the above groups will be identified in 12 parallel solicitations numbered, BPD-06-R-0015, BPD-06-R-0016, and BPD-06-R-0017 for Service Group 1; BPD-07-R-0008 and BPD-07-R-0009 for Service Group 2; BPD-07-R-0010 and BPD-07-R-0011 for Service Group 3; BPD-07-R-0012 and BPD-07-R-0013 for Service Group 4; and BPD-07-R-0014, BPD-07-R-0015 and BPD-07-R-0016 for Service Group 5.  

The resulting order of precedence within Service Group 5 Professional/Technical, with regards to the competition of task orders, is as follows:  Blended Small Disadvantaged Business Participant (includes 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSBs) Competition; Small Business Competition; and Unrestricted Competition.  

Blended Contractors, followed by the Small Business Contractors, will be given priority consideration on requirements 1, 3, 4 and 5.  Small Business Contractors will be given priority consideration on requirement 2. (See uploaded revised Award Process Flowchart).  Considering that the Government intends to award multiple contracts under each parallel solicitation, the following procedures and selection criteria will be used to provide Contractors a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order (FAR 16.505(b), Ordering).  Each task proposal request will specify whether the task order is being awarded based upon lowest price or a combination of price and technical merit representing the best value to the Government.

<DESC>The General Services Administration is requesting proposals from natural gas suppliers to provide natural gas supply to Federal and non-Federal facilities in the District of Columbia and Maryland located in the Washington Gas Light Company (WashGas) service territory.  The successful offeror will supply natural gas, gas transportation and supply management for a contract term of five (5) years.  Deliveries will begin May 1, 2007 and end April 30, 2012.  A six (6) month extension period is included in the contract.  The approximate annual natural gas requirement to the WashGas citygate for 4 facilities is 4,525,000 dThs.  Approximately 75% of the gas requirement is for GSA?s Central Heating Plant (HOTA) located in Washington, DC.  In keeping with the gas supply management strategy developed for HOTA, the Government will require fixed pricing for the basis to deliver natural gas from the Henry Hub to the WashGas city-gate excluding the natural gas commodity that will be priced at NYMEX market prices at the time that natural gas supplies are ordered.  This basis price will be fixed for the entire contract term.  In addition to the basis price for base load supplies, the contract will seek fixed prices for incremental load pricing that will also remain fixed for the entire contract term.  In accordance with the terms of the solicitation, the margin to the Transco Zone 6 Non-New York Mid-Point will be fixed for incremental commodity requirements.  For the HOTA accounts, up to three (3) separate price locks for base load gas will be permitted for a given month with any non-base load gas priced on the daily market via the incremental pricing.  For smaller accounts, only one price lock for base load gas will generally be permitted for any given month.  This is a requirements contract and multiple awards will not be considered.  The procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP) conducted in accordance with Part 12 (Commercial Item) of the FAR.  This announcement constitutes the presolicitation notice and the synopsis.  The Government intends to award a contract to the offeror that offers the lowest evaluated price for each pricing group and meets the solicitation's technical requirements.  Supplier technical responses to the solicitation are due no later than 2:00 p.m. on October 24, 2006 at the GSA Bid Room (see solicitation for address).  Pricing will be submitted in accordance with the solicitation on November 1, 2006 no later than 10:30 a.m.  This procurement is being conducted on an unrestricted basis.  Contact Mr. Ken Shutika on (202) 260-9713 (ken.shutika@gsa.gov) if you have any questions.

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/ OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per  the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

	1.  Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary to order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contracts, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified to each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and include item (d), as necessary:

a.	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license, at a minimum, shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitted; and

b.	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

c.	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

d.	A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBA documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously, or at the time of pick up, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.  Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter, as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

	3.  Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for what specific time thereafter, as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

	4.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractors record copy, at the time of Release of Claims, to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<ARCHDATE>10052007
<CONTACT>John Sherman Contracting Officer 3032360225     John_Sherman@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) within the Department of the Interior (DOI) in accordance with FAR 6.302 intends to negotiate a sole source procurement with Information Handling Services, 15 Inverness Way East Englewood, CO  80112-5776 for  Petra Software Licenses.  The availability of funds clause is applicable to this notice. The BLM provides opportunities for commercial development domestic energy resources on public and Indian lands through the leasing and production of oil and gas.  Currently, the BLM manages and regulates over 22,000 Federal and 6,000 Indian oil and gas leases mostly throughout the West, but in other energy producing States as well. In determining the volume and value of oil and gas deposits that are contained on Federal and Indian lands, BLM geologists, engineers, and technical support staff conduct reservoir analyses of potential producing reservoirs.  These analyses include conducting paying well determinations to determine whether there are economic resources to authorize leases, approve unitiziation and communitization agreements, conduct drainage and Indian diligence reviews, approve wells spacing units, and determine fair market value of parcels offered at Indian oil and gas lease sales. In order to keep pace with the level of drilling and development activities resulting from recent increases in both the price of oil and gas and the demand for energy resources, the use automated software will greatly enhance the BLM's ability to conduct reservoir analyses in a timely and efficient manner.  This software must provide BLM geoscientists and engineers with extensive sets of tools to easily and rapidly resolve key characteristics of a reservoir or prospects by interactively defining geometry, extracting reservoir properties from logs, and making volumetric estimates from surface models. There are specific requirements that this software must have in the areas of oil and gas well Data Management, Information Extraction, and Transformation and Calculation of data and information from well logs in digitized or raster formats. Data Management This software must provide quality control tools that permit interactive editing of all data using built-in spreadsheets, graphical displays, and data tables. It should allow for easy manipulation of all well data, formation data, completions and tests, directional surveys, user-defined "z" values, well logs, and production and history data. "Zone" concept provides an efficient method of organizing reservoir properties based on subsurface intervals typically defined by formation or layer boundaries. Seismic database provides the basis for import, manipulation and display of 2D and 3D seismic locations and attribute values. Projects can contain an unlimited number of user-defined zones, each of which can contain an unlimited number of variables defined as either numeric "z" values, text data, or date field. Each numeric or date value can be commented with remarks. Formation tops include fields for measured depth, quality code, and remarks for each value. Subsea values are computed "on the fly" when needed.  Tops may be edited as either measured or subsea TVD values. It must fully support deviated wells, including horizontal well boreholes and provides easy data entry and editing using a built-in spreadsheet with graphical previewer. Directional surveys may be imported from and exported to ASCII files. It must provide user-definable criteria for selecting wells from the project database to be used for further analysis. Users should have instant access to all information for a specific well on any display (i.e., map, cross section, or spreadsheet) by double-clicking the mouse on the well. The software can import well and production data from a variety of commercial vendor formats as well as user-specific spreadsheets and databases. Log data can be imported and exported using standard LAS and LIS formats. It shuld produce user-definable reports and export tabular data in a variety of ASCII formats. The software should output all graphical displays to any standard Windows printer or write a Windows metafile (WMF) for integration with standard presentation packages. Information Extraction This software must be capable of extracting reservoir properties from well log data including: gross, net, net-to-gross ratio, porosity feet, permeability feet, hydrocarbon feet, average porosity, average permeability, and average water saturation for multiple wells and zones simultaneously. Cross section display provides tools to interactively correlate formation tops and select high and low (i.e., sand/shale) log curve amplitude picks crucial for log normalization. It should be capable of accessing the monthly production data to compute cumulative production, running averages, and field-wide summaries. It must provide functions to easily isolate IP and formation test data by zone. Tightly integrates information gathered from these processes by storing results directly in the project database, making them immediately available for mapping or transformations. It must be capable of providing links to reservoir simulation through production stream history matching and geological surfaces. Transformations and Calculations The software's log transformation functions include industry standard and user defined equations for log analysis and normalization. It uses zone boundary definitions to compute isopach thickness for one or more zones. Isopach values may incorporate directional borehole corrections and even incorporate structural dip and azimuth to provide true stratigraphic thickness. Users are provided with definable equation evaluator for transforming zone "z" variables, such as oil-in-place. The software can construct gridded surface models of well, seismic, and hand-entered "z" data, while incorporating user interpretations using hand-drawn or digitized contours. It is capable of producing volumetic reports from any gridded surface over more or more polygonal areas. Since there are over 18 individual BLM Field Offices with oil and gas reservoir analyses responsibilities, this software must be user friendly, provide for simultaneous access by multiple users, and provide for frequent updates of well data, as the level of oil and gas development activities are expected to continue to increase in the near future.  This software should also have the capability of being integrated with automated oil and gas economic evaluation software already in use by BLM. There will not be a solicitation along with this announcement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. It is not a solicitation or a request for offers. No solicitation package is available

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for an extended period of Mission Operations and Data Analysis (MO&DA) for the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) science investigation. NASA/GSFC intends to continue this space physics and astronomy investigation with Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, Advanced Technology Center (LM ATC) on a sole-source basis.  The authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Lockheed Martin is the only organization qualified to perform this requirement due to their unique knowledge of the TRACE instrument and overall science investigation.  Lockheed Martin was competitively selected as the Principal Investigator of the TRACE mission over seven years ago and has been responsible for the design, development, integration, test, operation, and scientific data analysis for TRACE since its inception.   A new contractor would be required to duplicate substantial amounts of effort already undertaken by LM ATC.  As a result, unacceptable delays would be incurred during this necessary training period at a time when error-free science operations are required to prevent the loss of critical scientific data.   This extended MO&DA phase will be for a period of three years and includes requirements for science operations planning; monitoring correct instrument status (instrument “health and safety”) and performance; acquiring, disseminating, and analyzing data; and managing the science investigation, including coordination within the TRACE team and liaison with NASA.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested firms may, by the response due date, submit in writing to the identified point of contact their qualifications/capabilities.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to negotiate and issue a sole source modification to extend Contract N00019-02-D-3157 for a 12-month period consisting of one (1) six-month option and (2) two three-month options pursuant to FAR Par 6.302-1.  The purpose of the modification is to provide Commercial Air Services of various types to support fleet combat readiness training services until completion of a competitive award. Aircraft capabilities are, but not limited to, carrying of external pods for Electronic Warfare, target towing, and internal military operations (Air Intercept Control, Electronic Combat, Antisubmarine Air Control, RDT&E Electronic Combat, etc.).  If all option periods are exercised, the contract will be extended from 30 March 2007 through 30 March 2008 at which time a competitively awarded contract will commence.  The current contractor, L-3 Communications Flight International, is the only source available to provide the required services for a 12-month period, due to extensive day-to-day contact between the government, fleet schedulers, and contractor personnel, required aircraft and equipment, and short time frame of performance for which these critical readiness training services are required.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

Numbered Note 22:  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Wendy Stevenson, 703-432-3267, Dorinne Rivoal, 703-432-3274
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions submitted by potential offerors. Q1. The terms “tester” and “tester system” are used throughout the solicitation.  Are you talking about two different pieces of equipment or the same thing?  That is, is one piece of test equipment supposed to test both on the vehicle and on the bench?  People I’ve spoken to say that the only conclusive way to test a transmission off the vehicle is with a dynamometer.  Response:  "Test System" refers to the "tester" along with all included cables/adapters and transit case. On-system and bench test requirements are answered in Question 2.  Q2.  What do you want the tester to do?  Testing for defaulting to second gear?  Shift point irregularities? Electro-magnetic interference problems with communication equipment?  Response:  The "system" will be required to test all electronic and electo-mechanical parts of the transmission to include, but not limited to, the Transmission Control Module (TCM), solenoids, internal cables, etc.  Test shall include mechanical actuation of electo-mechanical components to ensure proper shifting of the transmission through all ranges and correct response to all commands of the TCM.  The test system shall also provide for testing of the TCM to ensure proper operation. Q3.  Will there be any repair work associated with the tester or tester system?  That is, will any repair tools be included with the tester system package?  Response:  No.  Q4.  At what level of service will the tester system package be used?  I assume it will be field service.  Response:  Yes, field service and at all other levels of maintenance. Q5.  Is there any type of material preferred for the case?  Response:  plastic.  Do you want rollers?  Response:  No.  Is it anticipated to be portable by one person?  Response:  Yes. Q6.  Do you expect service manuals and quick start guides to be included with the proposal?  Response:  Yes.  Q7.  Since the label must have NSN 4910-01-495-8155 on it, does that mean that only the Trans x2000 may be supplied?  Response:  No. The response date and time remains unchanged.  All proposals must be submitted to the following address:  Commanding General, Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn:  Ms. Wendy Stevenson, CTQ3WS, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134-6050, or electronically at wendy.stevenson@usmc.mil no later than 2:00 PM EST, October 19, 2006.

However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and supplies are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.

<DESC>The California Institute of Technology’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), operating under a prime contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), seeks to identify potential sources interested in responding to a Letter of Interest (LOI) for the Data Capture and Delivery (DCD) communications subsystem in support of the Deep Space Mission Systems (DSMS) Ground Communications Network. KEY REQUIREMENTS – The DCD subsystem is an upgrade effort for the Ground Communications Network of the Deep Space Network (DSN). The DSN is an international network of antennas that support deep space missions and radio and radar astronomy observations for the exploration of the solar system and the universe. Within the Ground Communications Network of the DSN, the DCD subsystem will be responsible for: (A) Capture of mission telemetry and tracking data that are acquired by the Deep Space Network (DSN) as a result of space-to-ground downlink activities; (B) Delivery of mission telemetry and tracking data to other Deep Space Mission Systems (DSMS) elements for computation of Doppler and ranging observables; (C) Short-term buffering of the data to accommodate the bandwidth constraint or outages in the wide area network prior to successful custody transfer; (D) Cataloging data to enable query and data accounting; (E)Managing data delivery to mission operations service subscribers (such as a Flight Project Mission Operations Center), and other DSMS elements for subsequent processing, per priority subscription; and (F) Generating data accountability records for service-level performance.   Due to the criticality of the data for deep space mission operations, it is essential that the DCD provide exceptionally high reliability and availability while minimizing delivery latency. Some of the communication protocols to be supported include: (A) Data Capture Protocol:  a stream-oriented, application/ transport layer protocol for transferring data capture units transferred from front-end producers associated with DSN antennas to the DCD over local area networks; (B) File Exchange Protocol:  an application/ transport layer protocol used for delivering files with attendant metadata over local or wide area networks; (C) Stream Delivery Protocol:  an application/transport layer protocol used for delivering data streams with attendant metadata over local or wide area networks; and (D) Delivery Request and Catalog Request Query Protocol:  application/transport layer protocols used for requesting data delivery or catalog information over local or wide area networks. This very brief description is not complete, but does encapsulate much of the functionality that the DCD subsystem will provide. WHO MAY RESPOND? This LOI is open to the IT industry; other government agencies (i.e., any non-NASA, U.S. federal executive agency); national laboratory or Federally Funded Research & Development Center (FFRDC). COMPLIANCE WITH EXPORT CONTROL REGULATIONS – U.S. law requires that no export controlled technical and/or scientific information/data can be transferred to Foreign Persons. If your corporation agrees to limit access to U.S. Persons only, then such information/data that has been marked as export controlled may be transferred. If your organization has determined that a foreign national(s) will be involved either directly or indirectly in the performance of any resulting effort, please notify JPL immediately, in writing, providing the name of the individual(s) and the capacity under which they will be working so that the necessary steps can be taken. For your convenience, we have provided the following definitions: (A) U.S. Person: is any natural person who is a lawful permanent resident as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(20) or who is a protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3).  It also means any corporation, business, partnership, trust, society or any other entity or group that is incorporated to do business in the United States, as well as any governmental (federal, state or local) entity.  It does not include any foreign person as defined in (B). (B) Foreign person: Foreign person means any natural person who is not a lawful permanent resident as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(20) or who is not a protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3). It also means any foreign corporation, business association, partnership, trust, society or any other entity or group that is not incorporated or organized to do business in the United States, as well as international organizations, foreign governments and any agency or subdivision of foreign governments (e.g. diplomatic missions). DUE DATE:  Potential sources should respond to this LOI via email to maryhelen.ruiz@jpl.nasa.gov no later than October 20, 2006, 3:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time, including (a) company name; (b) contact information; (c) business status (large business, small business, small disadvantaged business; woman-owned, foreign entity, etc.) and (d) any other information about your company and/or experience in this type of effort. Company literature should be mailed to JPL, Attn: Mary Helen Ruiz, M/S 190-205, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109-8099. POINT OF CONTACT – Technical questions should be directed to Felicia Sanders; (P) 818.393.4993; (F) 818.393.5151; Email: felicia.a.sanders@jpl.nasa.gov DISCLAIMER: It is emphasized that the requested information is for preliminary planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that JPL will solicit you for such procurement in the future.

<DESC>The Program Executive Office Littoral Mine Warfare – Counter Remotely Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) Program Office (PMS 408), Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC, is soliciting new and innovative concepts in the development and demonstration of technologies applicable to existing dismounted electronic warfare systems. The growing use of Remotely Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RCIED) against dismounted troops in Iraq and Afghanistan requires the program office to continually seek out new possibilities/capabilities to protect our forces around the world.   To this end, the Navy is looking to fund studies to explore technology that will provide short term system enhancements for any company’s dismounted CREW product that has been tested at the Combating Terrorism Technology Task Force Testing (CTTTF) Joint Experimental Research Complex (JERC) test site.   Any such study will explore technology that will provide short term syst!  em improvements that would increase the systems effectiveness distance against single and multiple threats. Improvement of the systems interoperability with existing fielded CREW systems and improvements in operator suitability which would include system size, weight and ergonomics may also be studied.  If chosen, the Navy will fund the contractor to perform an in-depth study exploring the technology that would lead to specific system changes required to increase the performance of the dismounted CREW system in the areas stated above.    This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) will be open for one year from the date of the announcement. Proposals may be submitted at any time within that period.  Contracts and other transactions may be awarded, as appropriate, and will be limited by funding availability. It is expected that no one award will exceed $150,000.  Therefore, early submission of proposals is desirable and encouraged. Navy evaluation will commence after 10 October 2006 and initial awards are anticipated by the end of October 2006. Proposals should be submitted to: COMMANDER, Naval Surface Warfare Center, ATTN: Code C13, Renee Brown, 101 Strauss Avenue, Bldg 1558, Indian Head, MD 20640.  Contracting Point of Contact is Renee Brown, telephone (301) 744-6653, e-mail renee.m.brown@navy.mil. This synopsis constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) per FAR 6.102(d)(2)(i); there will be no formal request for proposals (RFP) or other solicitation in regard to this announcement.   Because both the technical and cost aspects of an offeror's submission will be evaluated at the same time, it is desirable that one volume containing all information be submitted. In presenting the proposal material, prospective offerors are advised that quality of the information is significantly more important than the quantity. Therefore, offerors are requested to confine their submissions to essential matters, providing sufficient information to define their offer and establish an adequate basis for the Government to conduct its evaluation. Offerors may submit their proposals (two paper copies and ten electronic copies on CD using Microsoft Office 2000 or earlier).     Respondents must be able to certify that they have an appropriate facility clearance to meet the security requirements of work proposed, and key personnel must be certified as holding an appropriate clearance. Proposals shall consist of one volume consisting of the technical proposal, management approach, !  and cost. The technical proposal is limited to 10 pages and cost and management information is limited to 5 pages. Pages are to be 8.5 x 11 inch, single-sided. Minimum font is 10 point. Succinct proposals are desired.     The technical portion shall consist of the following sections, each starting on a new page:     (1) A cover page, including proposal title, technical and administrative points-of-contact along with the telephone and facsimile numbers, followed by a letter signed by the authorized officer specifying the proposal validity period (at least 120 days); (2) An Executive Overview of the proposed system, the technologies and/or concepts the system employs and short term improvements that could increase system effectiveness that would be explored in a study.  Also include the details such as time and date of the CTTTF testing that is required to be eligible for this effort. (3) A detailed technical proposal of the primary precepts to improve the performance of the !  Dismounted CREW system in the areas listed above. (4) A summary of the  schedule and milestones for the proposed effort.  (5) A brief discussion of past performance detailing previous accomplishments and work in this or closely related research areas, previous cost and schedule performance, and the qualifications of the previous key personnel.  The selection of proposals for contract award will be based on a scientific review of proposals submitted in response to this BAA. The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine the relative merit of the technical approach of each proposal. Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, may also be considered as part of the evaluation. Selection of proposals for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of funds. Specific evaluation criteria are as follows:     (1)       Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues will improve the offeror’s dismounted CREW system performance.    (2)       The offeror's ability to quickly implement the proposed technology outlined in the study into the companies existing dismounted CREW system.    (3)    The extent to which offerors identify and commit to small businesses and to small disadvant!  aged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, women-owned small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, or other minority institution participation in the proposed effort, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor relationship.     THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR AWARD ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED.

<DESC>The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) is seeking a one-man portable X-Ray system capable of simultaneously imaging and differentiating between organic and inorganic explosive, firing train materials, and electrical components that may be concealed inside parcels or containers (e.g. fabric, cardboard, aluminum, thick steel, etc.).  This announcement serves to survey potential sources for product availability that fully defines existing equipment technology features, capabilities, and performance as described herein and is NOT a request for proposal.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment, implied or otherwise, to procure equipment or services.  Future requirements and procurements are uncertain.  BACKGROUND: Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Technicians utilize x-ray technology to aid in identifying, neutralizing, and rendering safe unexploded ordnance (UXO).  Current eq!  uipment is reaching service life limits and needs to be replaced with a Future Radiographic System (FRS) that takes advantage of mature X-Ray technology.  Potential solutions may include: Single Sided Visual Systems; Camera or Digital X-Ray Combination Systems; CMOS Portable High Resolution Digital X-Ray; self-Developing Radiographic Film; Three Dimensional Tomography Imaging Systems; Image Interpreter Programs; Image Gradual Intensity Programs; Ultrasound; Thermal Imagers; Thermal Infrared Cameras; and Magnetic Response Imaging.  DESIRED CAPABILITIES: The capability of providing a view in three dimensions is desirable but not mandatory.  The capability to identify filler materials is highly desirable but not mandatory.  Identifying the chemical composition of explosives is a requirement for filler material identification.  REQUIRED INFORMATION: Interested firms are encouraged to respond by providing a technical description, in TEN (10) or fewer pages, in the following form!  at.  1.0 General Information -  1.1 Vendor Information - Company name,  address, point of contact, email and postal address, telephone number, and related WebPages, if applicable. 1.2 System - Portable System name and model. 1.3 Function - Objects of interest that the System can inspect for (example: mail, small parcels, and personal bags). 1.4 System Picture - Photograph of System and accessories. 1.5 Technology - A brief description of the technology used by the system consisting of the technology title and a few descriptive sentences. 1.6 Output - Samples of output produced by the system while in operation. 2.0 Performance - Parameters for the System.  2.1 Detection/Identification - Effectiveness measured as image quality, correct composition of filler materials output, and the ability of a relatively untrained operator to correctly interpret the image of organics/inorganics and can include a percentage of the number of successful detections compared to the number of objects of interest inspected. 2.1.1 - Successful Detections/Identification!  s include: a. True Positives - System determines the presence of and identifies explosives or firing train components. b. True Negatives - System determines that explosives and firing trains are not present when they are not present.  2.1.2 Unsuccessful detections include: a. False Positives - System determines that there are explosives or firing train components present, and/or incorrectly identifies composition of filler material when explosives or firing train components are NOT present and, b. False Negatives - System determines that there are no explosives or firing train components present when explosives or firing train components ARE present. 2.2 Detection/Identification Speed - Measured in analyzed objects per hour, as the number of objects of interest (firing train components, explosives) that can be fully inspected per hour once the System is operational.  2.3 Inspecting Time - Defined as the minimum time interval possible between the start of an object imaging p!  rocess to the next imaging process. This includes the total time for a n inspector to collect images from the item of interest, analyze data, and move to the next. 2.4 Ease of Use - A subjective evaluation based on the responses of an operator survey, which assess the level of difficulty of operation. 2.5 Transportability/Portability - consists of two functions: a. Ability of the entire system to be transported by two people while in the storage configuration; and, b. Ability of the system to be transported by one person when it is not in the storage configuration. 2.6 Reliability - measured by the degree that the System will complete the required mission without an operational mission failure for all objects requiring screening.  Inability of the System to indicate the presence of and identify possible explosives and/or firing train components constitutes an operational mission failure if filler identification is claimed. 2.7 Maintainability (Mean Time Between Maintenance) - measured in hours, as the duration of time that, on average, the syst!  em will function as designed without maintenance beyond actions that can be performed by the operator with a prescribed list of spare parts and/or consumable supplies. 3.0 Standard Conditions and Threat - These standard conditions and representative Items of Concern (IoCs) are intended to provide a common basis for comparing each of the system's features, capabilities, and performance against user-defined requirements. 3.1 Representative IoCs - shall be used as objects of interest that contain typical explosives that might convey through the Point of Entry.  The IoCs shall consist of various explosives that might be contained in, or on mail, small parcels, and personal articles. 3.2 Typical Operational Scenario - Systems will be used to non-intrusively inspect and identify internal components of mail, small parcels, and personal articles. 3.3 Typical Environmental Conditions – Ambient weather / climatic conditions are expected to: a) range from 0 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit; !  b) range from 10 to 95% humidity; c) barometric pressure ranges from s ea level to 3000 feet above sea level; and d) may contain saltwater spray, dust, rain, or snow. 3.4 Typical Operator Abilities - The operator is: a) a soldier, sailor, airman, marine or security personnel; b) supplied with vendor's written manuals; c) trained by the manufacturer on the proper operation of the equipment; and d) software loaded onto EOD Unit's laptop. 4.0 System Description and Characteristics. 4.1.

The STTR provides range customers with realistic SATCOM environments to support their events.  Signal environments encompass the ability to emulate typical SATCOM signals both from their spectral presentation and representative traffic over typical SATCOM commercial and military satellites.  Since space environments are event specific and vary from event to event, MCATS III requires the flexibility to configure for different space environments. 
MCATS III must be able to generate a variety of signal types and the capability to transmit a sufficient number of signals to provide representative transponder loading in both bandwidth and power.  At a minimum, MCATS III must produce between 50 and 100 simultaneous satellite signals to at least two satellites in any combination of X, C, Ku, and television (analog and digital) signals. 
MCATS III will also include a complete suite of communications methods to provide range control and interconnection with other USAF and national ranges.  These communication methods include Public Switched Telephone System (PSTN), Defense Switched Network (DSN), Digital Inmarsat Terminals, Iridium Handsets, Cellular / Wireless Handsets, Ultra high frequency (UHF) / very high frequency (VHF) Radios, and Nevada Test & Training Range (NTTR) UHF trunked land mobile radios.
MCATS III must be equipped with signal measurement and analysis capability to provide timely information to the range operator to detect and issue cease operations commands (aka "cease buzzer").
B. Space Range operations Center (SROC): Design, develop, build, test, and install equipment in a facility at Schriever AFB, CO that replicates the MCATS III capability in a fixed location with the addition of equipment and capability to perform the range scheduling functions.

C. Sustainment:  Provide sparing and repairing for STTR systems.  At a minimum these systems include: MCATS I, II, III, and the SROC; and optimally include the Terrestrial Based Transponder (TBT).

D. Security and Other:  A minimum of two persons for this effort must possess a DOD TOP SECRET/SCI security clearance and the information required by numbered note 25.

This is a new requirement.  The period of performance is 4 years, and it is anticipated that a cost-reimbursement completion contract will be awarded for this requirement.  A growing body of scientific evidence suggests that infertility treatment may impact human health and development.  The number of children conceived with the help of infertility treatments currently comprises approximately 1-2% of live births in the United States, but the proportion is expected to continue to increase and the characteristics of the women undergoing treatment to change as more States begin to mandate health insurance coverage for infertility and ART procedures and as the efficacy of these therapies continues to improve.  A recent report of the U.S. President?s Council on Bioethics called for: (a) improved monitoring of infertility treatments and outcomes, (b) long-term longitudinal studies to assess child health concerns, and (c) improved/expanded decision-making for parents and practitioners.  Moreover, the Council called attention to the fact that virtually no data exist for populations of such children with regard to their growth and neurodevelopment during infancy and childhood.  Given that a notable portion of children conceived with the help of infertility treatment are born early or growth-restricted, they are a subgroup of children at risk for developmental disabilities including subtle differences in perception, cognition, vision, or motor skills.  These endpoints are in need of systematic, empirical, and longitudinal investigation.

Choice of comparison population remains an issue for children conceived by infertility treatment or ART, given that the preponderance of literature has relied upon naturally-conceived children (assumed or otherwise).  More appropriate comparison groups, particularly for long-term outcomes among singletons infants, might be children of subfecund couples who become pregnant without ovulation-induction agents or ART.  To ensure sufficient power for a longitudinal follow-up, to have access to a large enough sample of women and outcomes (for comparison at various levels of fertility), and to avoid a lack of generalizability due to the specialized treatment regimens employed at individual clinics, any study attempting to answer questions (i.e., differential loss to follow-up, longitudinal trends, choice of controls) about the long-term consequences of fertility treatment needs to be population-based.  A population-based study is now possible because the revised U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth that is being phased in nationally includes a question about the use of infertility treatment in the Prenatal Tests and Procedures section, and that question can be used to identify appropriate children for follow-up.  

Objectives

A population-based sampling strategy will be used to recruit in a ratio of 1:3 a matched-exposure cohort of infants identified from pregnancies conceived with the help of infertility treatment, as noted on birth certificates, and children who were conceived without such therapies.  For the primary cohort, a total of 1,500 infants identified on birth certificates as having been conceived by infertility treatment (exposed) are to be enrolled as study subjects at three to five months of age (gestation-corrected, if necessary) and followed longitudinally for three years (until age 36 months), along with the cohort of 4,500 unexposed children, matched for maternal age, zip code of residence, and plurality of birth. All co-twins (or triplet siblings) of study subjects are also to be enrolled simultaneously and either their outcomes noted (e.g., stillbirth, neonatal mortality), or they are to be followed (secondary cohort) on the same schedule as study subjects.  Assuming that approximately a third of the birth outcomes from infertility treatment are twins or higher order multiples, the secondary cohort is expected to number 2,000 (500 twin siblings of exposed and 1,500 twin siblings of unexposed infants).  The period of recruitment for the cohorts is expected to last 10 months to one calendar year.  The sampling frame for the study is expected to be either a State or consortium of States that have real-time access to birth certificates and adequate numbers of births from infertility treatment to meet study requirements.

Parents will be asked to participate in the study for three years by: (a) completing an initial questionnaire about the pregnancy, including, for example, confirmation of infertility treatment, time-to-pregnancy, infant feeding, and other demographic and socio-economic factors (i.e., maternal education, occupation) and confounders associated with motor and social development; (b) completing a standardized screening instrument that addresses their child?s motor and social development at chronologic or gestation-corrected ages 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, and 36 months; and (c) providing information on the child?s growth and medical history (e.g., illnesses, diagnoses of birth defects, major impairments).  Whenever possible, records will be linked to other pertinent health records (e.g., early intervention programs, WIC, birth defect or cancer registries).  Depending upon State requirements, screening results will be communicated to parents, and parents expressing concern about their children will be given contact information for State-approved developmental assessment centers and early intervention programs.

Requirements

To be deemed capable to implement the longitudinal study, a Small Business Concern must submit a written capability statement that clearly demonstrates their ability to:
 
1.  Have demonstrated real-time (electronic submission) access to birth certificates to identify and recruit parents for follow-up;

2.  Have access to birth certificates from State(s) or regions that have had mandated reported of infertility treatment for at least one year;

3.  Have demonstrated feasibility for achieving recruitment goals based on number of birth certificates positive for infertility treatment and be able to implement a plan for sampling;

4.  Have affirmative support from State health officials and the State administration for publicity and recruiting;

5.  Design a tracking system reactive to the State vital statistics system to ensure timely follow-up of infants and children through the 3 years of enrollment; 

6.  Implement a plan for contacting, recruiting and enrolling the cohorts of study subjects who are identified from birth certificates and implement the longitudinal protocol;

7.  Assist in the development and implementation of  a web-based data entry system provided by the NICHD and compile all data collected in the course of the study; and

8.  Provide final data sets with both primary and secondary cohorts also linked to other pertinent health registries (e.g., early intervention programs, WIC, birth defect or cancer registries).

AT THIS TIME THE NICHD IS ONLY REQUESTING CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM SMALL BUSINESSES. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541710.  Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is 500 employees or less.

<DESC>*This not a solicitation. This is only a Request for Information (RFI) and will not bind the contrac-tor or the Government in any way or at any time into a contract with any of the specified terms be-low. Introduction	 	The Army is planning its next generation of tactical wheeled vehicles to have information sys-tems integrated within the vehicle as part of the vehicles basic design. The Armys interest tracks with the current automotive in the dash system design that  provides a common information backbone, a common display/control system and addresses information needs on a per vehicle platform basis. In the case of normal automotive data like GPS information or engine temperature, the military and commercial automoti ve environments are well matched. However, the military environment has many independent command and control, logistical and sensor systems that are included in a vehicle that have been histori-cally  bolted on to the vehicle.  The information needs have progressed faster than the ability to include each new capability as a basic part of the vehicle, a process that will continue unless the vehicle system design anticipates change as part of the normal vehicle evolution. Unfortun ately, the current approach leads to sub-optimal designs that add user displays, increase power consumption, increase weight, reduce reliability, increase costs, etc.  In an effort to anticipate future changes, improve systems performance, improve maintenance/training and reduce cost, The Army is approaching the future with an alternative system engineering approach that integrates the automotive, communication, navigat ion, sensor, electronic maintenance, computational and data storage requirements as one integrated design approach. An alternative systems engineering ap-proach would be to integrate the automotive, communication, navigation, sensor, electronic maintenance  computational and data storage as one design approach.  As such, the Army is interested in finding inno-vative ways to apply emerging commercial standards to the Army vetronics systems. A migration to an integrated vehicular vetronics system has the additional challenge of including DoD specific equipment, such as a radio or chemical sensor, that must be addressed as part of the systems en-gineering approach.  The purpose of this Request for Information is to solicit ideas and concepts on integrating the various sys-tems employed in the tactical wheeled vehicle environment and build a system information architecture that can accommodate evolution to meet the cha nging needs and threats. Current Information Systems 	Tactical wheeled vehicles can have the following systems as part of a vehicle configuration: 	Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) 	Movement Tracking System (MTS) 	Vehicle Integrated Diagnostic Software (VIDS) 	Standard Army Maintenance System - Enhanced 	Digitized Preventive Maintenance Checks and Services 	Digital Log Book 	Several voice and data radios, e.g., SINCGARS Radio 	GPS receiver 	Integrated Electronic Technical Manuals 	Short range wireless communications (WiFi, Zigbee, others) 	Vehicle System Prognostic Hardware and Software 	SAE J1939 compatible vehicle sensors 	Vehicle electronic self protection systems Integrated Information System Goals 	As a framework for assessing an integrated vehicle information architecture, the following are a basic set of information system goals: 1.	Open System Architecture - The Army wants to capitalize on commercial technology that is open to competition. The information architecture has to be consistent with the use of software and hardware that does not limit the governments ability to improve  or modify the vehicle information architecture. 2.	Scalable Integrated Modular Architecture - The Army wants an information architecture that is modu-lar at the component (board / subsystem) level vice the current C2 system level. The architecture must be highly scaleable to add ress significant variation in individual vehicular platform processing re-quirements. It is anticipated that information architecture will have to process voice, video and data within the vehicle. The architecture should be resilient to failure and priorit ize resources to support critical system capabilities as required. The vehicle power subsystem must support the information systems within the vehicle as well as battery operated systems that are owned by individual soldiers, e.g., a handheld radio. 3.	Reliability, Maintainability and Availability (RAM) - The vehicles crew has many tasks so the inte-grated information system must be highly reliable, easy to maintain and almost always available. The Army is seeking significant RAM improvements over th e current set of individual subsystems. The vehicle should have the capability to quickly isolate a fault and, if possible, compensate for the failed component. 4.	Training - The goal is for an integrated information system to be easier to train for the operator and the maintainer than the collection of subsystems that it is replacing.  5.	Security  Many of the tactical wheeled vehicle users do not have a security clearance, however, some vehicles contain systems such as FBCB2 that will operate at the Secret level. Hence we are looking for innovative solutions for transmitting informatio n from two security domains over one or more networks. Since some of the vehicles will contain systems operating in one of two security do-mains (Secret and USI), we are interested in the computer/security architecture for processing data for each domain w hile ensuring separation. In these cases, it is desirable to use common storage and dis-play capabilities within the vehicle as part of an integrated architecture. Additionally, current best practice for computer network defense should be considered, e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection, intrusion prevention, etc. 6.	Long Term Evolution - Trucks can last decades and the electronics can be obsolete much sooner than the vehicle. The Army needs an information architecture that can change as change is required with very minor vehicle impact. The strategy for system evol ution is an integral part of the vehicle process.   7.	Procurement and maintenance costs - The Army is seeking a reduction in information system costs when procured/integrated as an integrated system vice individual subsystems.  Information requested The RFI response should be limited to a maximum of 50 pages. The RFI response should address the fol-lowing items: 1.	System Strategy - The white paper should provide a system strategy to integrate the various subsys-tems. The Government is interested in the rationale for the system decisions. The strategy should ad-dress if changes are all done at once or over several  iterations. As an example, the wiring could be in-stalled during a RECAP process while the electrical components are installed later as part of a vehicle upgrade. The system strategy should also identify what can be accomplished in 18 to 36 months. 2.	Notional Information architecture Concept - The white paper should provide a notional concept for implementing the chosen vehicle information system strategy. 3.	Logistical concept - The white paper should address improvements that are likely in the vehicle in-formation system RAM and operator/maintainer training. 4.	Cost impacts- If any significant cost savings are anticipated as a result of the chosen strategy. The white paper should address the rationale for the likely cost savings. 5.	Risk Areas - The white paper should provide a list of the key risk areas and suggested approaches to minimize the identified risk. Submit one electronic copy of the submission by 1 November 2006 to the following: Proprietary information should be clearly marked.  All submissions shall be (1) posted to the IBOP at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil/  under BAA W15P7T-07-R-PTWV The electronic format may be in Adobe Acrobat Portab le Document Format (PDF) or compatible with Microsoft Office 2000 suite of software. The white paper response shall not exceed 50 pages, including company information (single sided, single line spaced and utilizing Times New Roman font with 12-dot pitch). *REMINDER:  This not a solicitation. This is only a Request for Information (RFI) and will not bind the contractor or the Government in any way or at any time into a contract with any of the specified terms above.

<DESC>The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District is conducting a market survey on the availability of potential contractors to provide passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags for research purposes in support of the Walla Walla Distri ct, U.S Army Corps of Engineers. The current contractor is Digital Angel Corporation, 490 Villaume Avenue, South St. Paul, MN 55075, sole-source contractor.   Contractors who can provide the U. S Army Corps of Engineers with the passive integrated transpon der (PIT) tag, in accordance with the synopsis listed below, are invited to submit electronically an affirmative written response indicating a bona fide ability to meet this specific requirement listed below:   Conduct research studies to determine the survival of out-migrating juvenile and returning adult salmon through the lower Snake and Columbia River hydro-projects.  The Walla Walla District plans to purchase passive integrated transponder (PIT) 134 - 136 kH z tags for research purposes associated with the Northwestern Division's Anadromous Fish Evaluation Program. A PIT tag is classified as a sonar reading tag under the Standard Industrial Code #3812 and is subject to radio frequency licensing.  National Ocea nic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has verified their compliance with all pertinent Federal Communications Commission and National Telecommunications and Information Administration (Department of Commerce) requirements for radio frequency licensing. Each PIT tag must provide the necessary readability, reliability, high performance standard, and uniquely coded passive integrated transponder tag designed for all detection devices on the Columbia River system, including the development of a PIT tag detec tion system for the Corner Collector at Bonneville Dam.  Each tag must satisfy the Corpss requirements without requiring major purchases of new receiver equipment, new design of the Corner Collector technology, or compromised reliability.   The supplier must be able to produce and provide large quantities of PIT tags in a short time frame in order to meet delivery dates driven by the timing of out-migrating juvenile salmonids and research activities.  PIT tag delivery requirements of up to 50 0,000 PIT tags within two weeks have been required.  A delay in PIT tag delivery could delay research a full year with the loss of millions of dollars to the Government.   Responses should appear on company letterhead and include, at minimum, affirmation of active registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), your Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number, any applicable qualifications.     All responses should  include a point of contact, telephone number, and electronic address.     Additionally, respondents should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUBZone, service  disabled veteran-owned small business, or qualify as socially or economically disadvantaged and whether they are U.S. or foreign owned.     Responses to this notice will be used to determine the availability of this type of supply.     All responsible sou rces may respond to this synopsis and all responses will be considered by the agency. Responses should be furnished electronically by 10:00 A.M. PST, Monday, 16 October 2006 to the reference point of contact: Contract Specialist Ms.Carol Stimmel,     Email : Carol.J.Stimmel@usace.army.mil, Fax: (509) 527-7802.   This requirement will be for a base year and at the Governments option, two (one year) optional periods.  The size standard for small business concerns under NAICS 334511 is 750 employees.

<SUBJECT>R -- TSA - Man Portable Air Defense Systems Software Analysis
<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to issue a single source contract with Cunning Running Software, LTD of Romsey, Great Britain to provide software that it has previously developed in support of Man Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS) assessments for the TSA Law Enforcement Office.  This contract is not a software design contract, Cunning Running, LTD has already created the necessary software for this particular use.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has been tasked with the responsibility of securing our nations transportation systems.  Particularly, the Office of Security Assessments (OSA) is tasked with securing the commercial aviation community against the use of Man Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS).  Homeland Security Presidential Directives 5 and 7, the Aviation Transportation Security Act of 2001 (ATSA), and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 require us to conduct MANPADS Assessments at airports of high risk in the United States.

Due to the complexity of the assessment process and the intense manpower involved in conducting MANPADS and other stand-off weapons assessments, the Office of Security Assessments has a requirement for computer based analysis software that calculates complex algorithms in order to identify potential launch areas and threat profiles within the footprint of our nation?s airports.  The software must consider a variety of weapons system capabilities, geographic information, flight path analysis, and arbitrary map scales.  Additionally, it must support mitigation efforts by providing a platform to manage critical resources within a real-time operational environment.

The TSA needs this particular software immediately, and Cunning Running, LTD is currently the only vendor available that has this type of software immediately available.

Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
AGENCY:  U.S. Small Business Administration.
ACTION: Notice of intent to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Personal Computers. 
SUMMARY:  The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a request for a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Personal Computers Manufacturing.  According to the request, no small business manufacturers are supplying this class of product to the Federal government.  If granted, the waiver would allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses; service-disabled veteran-owned small business or SBA?s 8(a) Business Development Program.  
DATE: Comments and source information must be submitted [WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES].
ADDRESSES:  You may submit comments and source information to Edith Butler, Program Analyst, U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 8800, Washington, DC 20416.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATI0N CONTACT: Edith Butler, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 619-0422; by FAX at (202) 481-1788; or by email at edith.butler@sba.gov.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act (Act), 15 U.S.C.?637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or SBA?s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor of the product. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.  The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR?121.406(b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the Federal market.  
     As implemented in SBA?s regulations at 13 CFR?121.1202(c), in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months. The SBA defines "class of products" based on a six digit coding systems. 
 The coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  
     The SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Personal Computers, Manufacturing, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 334111.  The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for this class of NAICS code within 15 days after date of publication in the Federal Business Opportunities.

The following clause is incorporated in full text

52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) - ADDENDUM
52-212-2(a) is hereby tailored as follows:

(a) The Government will award a Firm, Fixed Price commercial contract resulting from this solicitation to the lowest priced, technically acceptable (LPTA) responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation.  The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.   Offerors are required to submit a technical proposal and a price proposal according to the factors set forth under this provision.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
	
FACTOR 1 ? TECHNICAL CAPABILITY
FACTOR 2 ? PRICE

FACTOR  1: TECHNICAL CAPABILITY

To be considered for award, an offeror?s technical proposal must be rated as acceptable. To be determined technically acceptable, the offeror must provide the requested services within the timeframe established and per the statement of work in the solicitation and all information and/or requirements listed.  Failure to submit any of the listed requirements will result in the offeror?s technical proposal being determined technically unacceptable.

The standard is met when:

„«	The offeror provides a brief, descriptive statement indicating the offeror?s credentials to deliver the services sought and within the time established under this RFP.
„«	The offeror provides a brief description of how long the offeror has been performing the services required by this RFP and include the number of years in business.
„«	The offeror provides a brief description of the organizations number of employees, client base, and location of offices.  
„«	The offeror provides the below information for one (1) relevant and recent government or commercial contracts.  See below for description of recent and relevant.  

Company Name
Project Title
Contracting Agency
Contract Number
A Brief Description of the Contract Effort
Type of Contract
Period of Performance
Original Contract value ($) and current value ($)
Point of Contact Name, Address, Telephone Number, and Fax Number

1.  RECENT.  For a contract to be considered recent, the contract must be performed or completed within the last three years (October 2003 through the current date).

2.  RELEVANT.  A government or commercial contract in which the contractor *satisfactorily* performs vehicle leasing services similar to those identified in the statement of work.
 	
*Satisfactory performance will be determined by the acquiring activity for the referenced contract   

FACTOR 2: PRICE

Only price proposals submitted by offerors whose technical proposals are determined to be technically acceptable will be considered for evaluation.  Award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable, responsible offeror.  Proposed prices will be evaluated using the price analysis techniques prescribed in FAR 15.404-1(b) to determine price reasonableness. 

Any inconsistencies (whether real or apparent) in price must be clearly justified.  For example,  if unique and innovative approaches are the basis for an abnormally low proposed price, the nature of these approaches and their impact to the proposed price must be completely documented.  The burden of proof for cost credibility rests solely with the offeror.  The following evaluation criteria shall apply: 

COMPLETENESS:  Price will be considered complete when the offeror has proposed firm fixed prices for CLINS 0001 through 0006.  Offers for partial quantities will not be considered for award.  Price will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror provided sufficient data as required by the solicitation and/or Contracting Officer during the evaluation.

REALISM:  Prices will be evaluated to determine if they are unrealistically high or low in comparison to the Independent Government Cost Estimate and other offers received.  

REASONABLENESS:  Prices will be determined reasonable by competition and balance.

Offerors are cautioned against submitting a materially unbalanced offer.  The Government will analyze offers to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to prices or separate line items.  Offers that are determined to be materially unbalanced may be rejected.  An offer is mathematically unbalanced if it is based on prices which are significantly less than the cost for some contract line items and significantly overstated in relation to cost for others.  An offer is materially unbalanced if it is mathematically unbalanced, and if:

There is reasonable doubt that the offer would result in the lowest overall cost to the Government, even though it is the lowest evaluated offer; or

The offer is so grossly unbalanced that its acceptance would be tantamount to allowing an advance payment.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced.  

(b)  Not used.

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-06-10704, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-12.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 which has a $6.5 million dollar size standard, however, it is anticipated that the contract will be awarded as a result of full and open competition. The purpose of this notice is to inform all interested parties that the Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC intends to award a Firm-fixed-price purchase order as a result of this solicitation.  Award will be made to a single contractor for all tasks.  Background:  Across the United States a growing number of areas have adopted citywide greening campaigns, such as ?Sustainable Portland? and ?Climate Responsible Cities?.  These communities have established these integrated programs to provide air quality and other environmental and quality of life benefits for their communities.   These campaigns have adopted a variety of actions in energy use, transportation planning, and land use, as well as metrics for measuring success on a variety of indicators such as air quality, livability, and traffic volume and congestion.  Enough programs are sufficiently established to provide a useful resource for communities wishing to adopt similar campaigns.   Purpose:  The primary purpose of this project is to conduct a comprehensive inventory of the various measures that U.S. communities, and exemplary international communities, have adopted which provide air quality benefits, as well as other co-benefits.  Depending on the availability of funds, two additional optional tasks are possible:  (1) evaluation of the effectiveness of the inventoried measures and (2) a methodology for designing a successful program for an interested area.   Primary Task 1: Measures Inventory This task is to compile a comprehensive inventory of the types of measures taken by communities in integrated ?greening? programs.  The inventory should comprehensively examine sustainability, smart growth, climate, or other integrated community programs, across the U.S. and in select international communities.  The inventory should comprise those measures which provide air quality benefits, to include, but not be limited to, land use, energy and transportation measures.   Measures should be categorized and sub-categorized, such as, Energy Management: Government Building Energy Retrofits, Use of LED Traffic Signals, and Use of Renewable Energy.  For each measure, there should be an indication of what cities have adopted them and their air quality and other benefits. Optional Task 2:  Measures effectiveness evaluation Ongoing ?greening? programs are sufficiently established to measure progress and the effectiveness of individual measures in the various programs.  These will likely be different from place to place, even for the same types of measures.  This option is to evaluate the effectiveness of the various measures in terms of adoption/implementation success and the magnitude of air quality benefits, especially in relation to the cost of the measures and the time required for implementation and results to be achieved.   The goal of this option is to identify:  Effective and successful measures which are readily transferable and provide air quality and other benefits; and factors influencing the effectiveness and transferability of a measure, such as: Cost of the measure;  Ease with which the measure can be explained and understand by a non-technical audience (e.g. scientific complexity); Extent to which the success of a measure is tied to a particular place due to a city?s culture or ?character? (e.g., self-identification as a ?green? community, like Portland); and Degree to which a measure is being pursued to meet a national or international goal such as energy security that may complement or conflict with a ?greening? goal. Optional Task 3:  Program Development Guidance This option is to use the information from the first option and develop guidance to communities for tailoring an integrated sustainability program appropriate to their community.  How this guidance would be developed should be outlined in the proposal, which will be considered during proposal selection. Place of performance is the contractor's facility.  The contractor shall prepare a monthly progress report on technical progress which will be due by the 30th of each month. Deliverables and Schedule:  Task 1)  Draft report due 3 months from award date, Final report in 4 months; Optional Task 2)  Draft report due within 6 months from award date, Final due within 8 months;  Optional Task 3)  Draft report due within 7 months from award date, Final due within 9 months.  The Government reserves the right to exercise the two optional tasks as funds permit.  The deliverable due dates may change accordingly.  The Project Officer will make the determination for the revised due dates.  The Government without prior written notification may exercise these options by issuing a contract modification.  Performance Period: Approximately 9 months from date of award.  Evaluation criteria - 1) Staff must have demonstrated experience and background in sustainable community programs, smart growth, climate responsible cities, which must be reflected within the submitted proposal;  2) Technical approach;  3)  Past Performance - Each offeror submitting a technically acceptable proposal shall be evaluated on performance under existing and prior (within the past 3 years) contracts/subcontracts/orders for services similar to that described in the Statement of Work for this requirement.  Provide at least 2 references for related projects conducted in the last 3 years.  Include project description, contact person and telephone number. Past performance will be used for responsibility determinations and as a factor against which offerors relative rankings will be compared to ensure the best value to the Government; and 4) PRICE. Award will be made to the offeror whose offer represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. Price each task separately. Technical capability and past performance when combined are significantly more important than cost and price. PAYMENT: Partial payment will be authorized upon acceptance and approval of each (final) deliverable.   Contractor must provide a price for each deliverable separately. The government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the government.  Only offerors submitting technically acceptable proposals shall be considered for award.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation in accordance with FAR Part 12.  No other solicitation will be issued; proposals are being requested via this notice.  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) enforces federal laws and regulations relating to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, explosives and arson.  The law and regulations (18 U.S.C. ? 923(f)(2) and 27 CFR, part 478, subpart E) provide for a hearing if an applicant or licensee requests one upon receipt of a notice of license denial or revocation.  ATF requires contractor services for these hearings.  ATF will award multiple blanket purchase agreements (BPA) as a result of this notice.  The Firearms and Explosives Industry Services Division (FEISD) will monitor the hearings.  Contract hearing officers who are under contract with the ATF shall be known as Special Hearing Officers.  Special Hearing Officers, hereinafter referred to as contractor(s), must possess sufficient abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them by the FEISD.  The abilities needed to successfully serve in this capacity necessitate the use of retired law enforcement Special Agents, Inspectors, Attorneys and Officers as Special Hearing Officers.  Each contractor, when conducting a hearing, is representing the ATF.  The ATF expects such representation to reflect positively on the Bureau.  To that end, contractors, when conducting hearings, must present themselves in a professional manner.  Upon completion of a hearing assignment each contractor must submit the following items to the FEISD: 1) Hard copy of the Hearing Officer Report; 2) Disk or CD containing the Hearing Officer Report; 3) Audio tape(s) of the hearing; 4) Completed Contractor Invoice for Payment; and 5) Attachments/exhibits as stated in the Hearing Officer Report.  These items must be hand delivered to the FEISD or shipped using Federal Express or other authorized carrier.  Hearing Officer Reports shall be submitted within ten business days of the completion of the hearing.  If a contractor determines that he or she cannot meet the due date for a particular report, the contractor must seek an extension from the FEISD.  Each contractor is responsible for ensuring that all of their reports are neatly prepared, grammatically correct, free of spelling errors, and most importantly, factually accurate.  Hearing Officer Reports must be able to stand up to de novo judicial review in U.S. District Court if necessary.  Repeated inaccuracies or discrepancies will result in the contract being terminated.  Hearing Officer Reports must objectively state the facts as presented during the hearing.  The hearing shall be recorded using an audio tape recorder, which will be provided by the Bureau and operated by the hearing officer.  The tape, along with the exhibits, shall constitute the official record of the hearing.  Contractors will be required to conduct the hearing, review the tape recording (post-hearing), take accurate notes of the hearing, and reduce those notes to writing in the form of a Hearing Officer Report.  In order to receive assignments and to complete the required Hearing Officer Reports, each contractor must possess, or have access to, certain equipment, and possess the knowledge to use it.  The following equipment and related software programs are required: 1) A personal computer with a Windows? operating system, preferably Windows 98? or newer; 2) An Inkjet or LaserJet printer.  Dot-matrix printers are not acceptable equipment; 3) A full version of Microsoft Word?. Microsoft Works? will not suffice as an acceptable software program; 4) Each personal computer must have Microsoft Excel? loaded thereon, or each contractor must be able to download from the World Wide Web a ?reader? that will permit the user to read Microsoft Excel? documents; and 5) Each personal computer must have loaded thereon Microsoft Outlook?.  Microsoft Outlook Express?, standing alone, will not be sufficient.  Pre and post-hearing responsibilities, in many cases, requires the contractor to use his or her personal telephone, cellular telephone, FAX machine, or other related equipment.  ATF assumes no responsibility for the purchase, maintenance, use or misuse of these devices. ATF will reimburse the contractor for reasonable and necessary FAX transmittals and long-distance telephone calls made in connection with the conduct of a hearing.  Local telephone calls or cellular airtime charges will not be reimbursed.  Each contractor must make every reasonable effort to protect data associated with a hearing.  Audiotapes, notes, exhibits, copies of Hearing Officer Reports, etc. are the sole property of ATF and must be safeguarded against unlawful disclosure.  The contractor will retain all notes and a copy of the Hearing Officer Report for 120 days after the official report and file is submitted.  The contractor is to destroy all notes and material at that time.  Identification media, ATF-provided software, and all other Government property must be surrendered when requested by the FEISD.  Contractors are expected to use their own private facilities when preparing the Hearing Officer Report in connection with hearings.  ATF assumes no responsibility for the purchase or maintenance of a contactor facility, nor will ATF reimburse any contractor for use of such facility.  Contractors must be able to conduct hearings within a 200-mile radius of their home.  Contractors are expected to possess an automobile with appropriate insurance coverage. ATF assumes no liability for contractor misconduct or negligence while driving their personal automobile in connection with their hearing assignments.  When using their personal automobile in connection with performing assignments, contractors will be reimbursed for mileage driven at the prevailing rate established by the General Services Administration.  Contractors must submit an invoice for payment detailing the number of miles driven, as well as any other incidental expenses, in connection with any particular assignment. Such invoice is subject to audit by the FEISD.  Each contractor shall undergo a personnel security investigation to determine their suitability to access ATF facilities, proprietary information, and/or data.  This investigation will be conducted by or under the auspices of the Personnel Security Branch, and be performed under such standards as the Personnel Security Branch may establish.  The contractor is advised that this investigation may take 90 days or more to complete, depending upon the complexities of the issues.  Failure to timely complete the required background forms, or failure to have a background investigation favorably adjudicated constitutes grounds for disqualification of the contractor.  Should the contractor be disqualified, he or she will not be granted unescorted access to any ATF facility, and access to ATF proprietary information or data will not be authorized.  Contractors are responsible for notifying the Personnel Security Branch of any changes in personnel information.  Contractors will be compensated for conducting the hearing, travel to the hearing site, travel back to their residence, and the preparation of the hearing officer report.  All travel must be pre-approved by the FEISD in order to be compensated.  Contractors will also be reimbursed for reasonable and ordinary expenses, such as long distance telephone calls, tolls, parking fees, etc.  Travel arrangements are the responsibility of the contractor and no advances will be made.  Airfares must be the coach or business class rate whichever is less.  The contractor shall submit such expenses detailed on an invoice specifying the hearing where the expenses apply.  This invoice, together with any other approved expenses incurred during any 30-day period will be summarized on a monthly invoice.  The Government has the right to audit all claims for payment or reimbursement.  The expert shall sign a non-disclosure agreement.
