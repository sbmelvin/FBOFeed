<DESC><p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>Air Force Research Laboratory, Materials and Manufacturing Technology Directorate, Metals, Ceramics and NDE Division, Nondestructive Evaluation Branch AFRL/RXLP is soliciting white papers on the research described below. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) strives to be the new technology to assess structural integrity and provide information to enable prognosis of the remaining useful life of the structural elements. Traditional nondestructive inspection (NDI) capabilities have been limited to post-flight inspection to inspect for structural damage and continue to be a strong validation component of SHM methodologies. Existing SHM approaches have largely evolved from traditional NDE technologies and strive to monitor significant changes in aircraft structures. Piezoelectric sensors, strain gages, surface ultrasonic and eddy current films have attempted to globally and/or locally capture the material state but lack the ability to reliably detect changes in the material in an operational environment. In order to promote a significant improvement in the capabilities of SHM, this effort seeks to create innovative solutions to material and component sensing. It is the purpose of this effort to develop novel sensing concepts for the detection of Undesired Material State (changes in a nominal physical response from the material without direct reference to baseline material information). Development is anticipated to focus on innovative material sensing alternatives (nanotechnologies, MEMS, etc.) for various aircraft structural material changes (properties, deterministic/non-deterministic damage, conductivity, coatings, etc.), with consideration of aircraft structure conditions (application, accessibility (buried/surface-breaking), material variances, etc.). Broad application opportunities are targeted for metallic, composite and hybrid structures on future aircraft systems (with potential to demonstrate on existing aircraft structures).</p>

<DESC><p>The NATO Command and Control Systems Management Agency (NACMA) intends to invite bids for the provision of Industrial Consultancy Support (ICS) to NACMA.</p>
<p>NACMA is serving as the NATO contracting agency for this project, which is being funded by authorization of the Infrastructure Committee. NACMA intends to use the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) Best Value procedure, in which price, technical, and management criteria are assessed in order to rank the submitted bids. The successful bid pursuant to this IFB (Invitation for International Bidding) will be that bid which provides the best value for the money after application of evaluation criteria that will be determined at the time of IFB release.</p>
<p>The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-12544-ACCS. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.</p>
<p>Prospective bidders are advised that the estimated quantity of support required under this contract is 62.5 man years, distributed over the duration of the contract. This estimate is for planning purposes only, and no commitment on behalf of NACMA to fully utilize this effort or its distribution throughout the contract period is implied or should be assumed.</p>
<p>Prospective bidders should be aware that NACMA reserves the right to exclude the successful bidder under this IFB, and any of the subcontractors, from future work related to the NATO Air Command and Control System (ACCS) and associated programs, in the event of any potential conflict of interest.</p>
<p>The IFB package will not contain material of a classified nature. The successful bidder, however, may be required to handle and store material up to the level of NATO SECRET, and therefore, prospective bidders must have appropriate storage and handling clearances. Bidders should also be aware that contractor personnel will be required to work at NATO or other national sites in order to fulfill the requirement of the contract and such personnel will be required to hold security clearances up to the level of NATO SECRET.</p>
<p>Facility and handling clearances and the personnel clearance for the prospective Project Manager must be in place prior to bid submission. Personnel clearances for contractor personnel working on the prospective contract must be in place prior to work commencing on task orders under the contract. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the NATO contracting agency the NATO clearance certifications needed for performance of the contract.</p>
<p>Bidders will be required to declare a bid validity of six months from the closing date for receipt of bids, supported by a bid guarantee of Euro 300,000. Should the selection and award period extend beyond six months from the closing date for receipt of bids, bidders will be asked to voluntarily extend the validity of their bid guarantee. Bidders may decline to do so and withdraw from the bidding process without penalty.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this procurement, it must first be approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB). The U.S. Department of Commerce is authorized to approve for participation in NATO ICB those firms with a facility located within the United States. Please visit the following website for a copy of the NATO ICB application:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>
</span></p>
<p>A firm that has been approved for participation in NATO ICB must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. A DOE is used to nominate a firm to the bidders list for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which uses the DOE to nominate the firm to the bidders list. The NATO contracting agency will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.</p>
<p>Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the NATO contracting agency when the IFB has been issued.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DEADLINES<br /><br />1. Final date to request a Declaration of Eligibility: 06 August 2008<br /><br />2. Anticipated date that the contracting agency will distribute the IFB: Q3 2008</p>
<p>3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: Q4 2008</p>
<p>4. Anticipated contract award date: Q1 2009</p>

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of Civil Rights,         requires the assistance of search firms to identify and refer qualified candidates in the targeted disabilities community to fill necessary positions.  The nine targeted disabilities are in accordance with Standard Form 256, Self Identification of Reportable Handicaps (Disabilities) Codes, specifically; Deafness (Codes 16 & 17), Blindness (Codes 23 & 25), Missing Extremities (Codes 28, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, and 38), Partial Paralysis (Codes 64, 65, 66, 67, and 68), Complete Paralysis ( Codes 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78), Convulsive Disorders (Code 82), Mental Retardation (Code 90), Mental Illness (Codes 91 & 92) and Distortion of the Spine and or limbs (Code 92).  Services needed will include:  advising FAA in identifying and analyzing any recruitment barriers; developing and presenting recruitment strategies; using a variety of search methods to identify qualified candidates; conducting preliminary and final reference checks; presenting candidate "short-lists" to the selecting official; conducting preliminary candidate interviews; advising FAA and assisting in hiring negotiations; and providing advisory services as needed.  
The FAA has a wide variety of administrative, technical and managerial requirements.  The most prevalent technical areas include aeronautics and aviation, telecommunications, engineering, technology, finance, contracts and human resource management.  Although each area requires different knowledge and skills, many positions also require experience and/or knowledge of aviation and the aviation industry.  The FAA also hires world class technical experts in specialized areas of aviation.  These positions are called Senior Professionals and qualifications vary based on the specialized field of science and technology that relates to the aviation industry.    
This market research seeks to identify potential sources for providing the services identified above as well as comments on the attached draft contract documentation.  The responses received will assist with defining the appropriate procurement strategy to obtain the necessary services.

<DESC>NASA has a requirement to extend its Engineering and Science Services (ESC)Contract NNJ05HI05C at the Johnson Space Center for a period of 3-years. This contractprovides engineering products and services supporting the JSC Engineering Directorate. The contract extension will extend the period of performance through January 31, 2013(current end date is January 31, 2010).   Jacobs Technology, Inc. is the ESC contractorwhich began February 1, 2005 performing engineering design, development, test, analysis,and real time operations support services for human spaceflight.  Pursuant to FAR6.302-1, NASA intends to extend the above contract to January 31, 2013.As the incumbent ESC contractor, Jacobs Technology, Inc. supports SSP systems prelaunchreadiness and on-orbit operations.  Transitioning the ESC contract in January 2010 posesmajor technical and safety risks to the Space Shuttle Program (SSP) final flights, andInternational Space Station (ISS). Jacobs Technology, Inc. also supports the design andhas built critical hardware for the 6 person crew necessary for initial operational phaseof a 6 person ISS crew in 2010.  It is essential that the operations and on-orbit anomalyresolution be supported by the teams that have designed and built this hardware.  Disruption due to contract transition poses significant technical risk to successful 6person crew operations on the ISS.   In addition to the critical support to the SSP & ISS programs, transitioning the contractposes a major technical risk to the Constellation Program (CxP).  Jacobs is supportingthe Engineering Directorate in the design and development of critical hardware for theOrion Project.	This hardware, which is in the preliminary design phase, is required tobe delivered to the Orion Project in 2013.  Examples of critical hardware design anddevelopment include: the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) Parachute Assembly System (CPAS),Low Impact Docking System (LIDS), and Androgynous Peripheral Assembly System (APAS) toLIDS Adapter System (ATLAS).  Transitioning the ESC contractor before 2013 would likelycause a significant disruption and delay in the continued development and production ofthe hardware needed for the initial operational capability of the Orion space vehicle.	This design work also affects the initial flights of Orion to ISS as well assystem/subsystem management support for the Orion Project.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities, qualifications and approach inwriting to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July31, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose ofdetermining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	Adetermination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Jacobs Technology,Inc. directly.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Cambridge Research & Instrumentation, Inc., of Woburn, Massachussetts, for the acquisition of a Varispec SNIR (Short/Near Infrared) Liquid Crystal Tunable Filter System and a Varispec LNIR (Long/Near Infrared) Liquid Crystal Tunable Filter System to be used in the Optical Technology Division of the Physics Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland. 

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

Sole source determination is based on the fact that NIST requires two Varispec Tunable Filter Systems (a SNIR and a LNIR) for its existing Varispec Optical Filter System in its lab (NIST property number 633237).  The two Varispec Tunable Filter Systems are designed for this specific model of optical filter system, and are plug-in compatible.  In addition, extensive software has been developed at NIST for controlling the existing system and would not be compatible with filter systems from other vendors.  No other source exists that can provide compatible, plug-in tunable filter systems as commercial items.
  

Cambridge Research & Instrumentation, Inc. is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required Varispec SNIR (Short/Near Infrared) Liquid Crystal Tunable Filter System and Varispec LNIR (Long/Near Infrared) Liquid Crystal Tunable Filter System.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by August 1, 2008 will be considered by the Government.

Justification:

This justification has been prepared under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(1).

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1) 	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).  

The Radiation Oncology Branch of the CCR treats cancer patients with radiation according to approved clinical protocols. These treatments involve complex radiation delivery techniques.  One of the newest techniques that promises a greatly improved accuracy in targeting the tumor is called Intensity Gated Radiation Therapy, or IGRT for short.  The Varian RPM system utilizes a reflective fiducial attached to a patients diaphragm and continuously monitored by an infrared video camera.  When the patients chest motion exceeds preset values, the treatment is interrupted automatically until it returns to within tolerance.  This permits the treatment of a more geometrically stable target.  In order for the system to function, an RPM module connected to a CT scanner must be utilized to observe an individuals diaphragm motion and establish their tolerance values, which are then sent to RMP workstations on each of the treatment machines.  

Varian Medical Systems is the sole provider of RPM gating systems.  In order for the RPM systems to work, they require a seamless interface and Varian has developed proprietary software for this to occur.  Varian is the only known sole manufacturer of the RPM Gating System and is the only known sole provider of factory trained service personnel.

<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis for two Miltenyi Biotec autoMACS Pro Starting Kits which include: autoMACS Pro Separator, a minisampler with lid, 1-5, 15, and 50mL tube racks, buffer combi pack, autoMACS columns, and user manual, setup &amp; installation, training, and a one year warranty with Miltenyi Biotec, Inc., 12740 Earhart Ave., Auburn CA 95602.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR 13.106-(b)(1)  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>We are proposing to purchase a Miltenyi Biotec autoMACS Pro separator which is an automated magnetic separation system.  The separator isolates specific sub-populations of cells or viruses from larger heterogeneous populations.  This is important to our research for developing new cytokine and antibody mediated therapies against infections diseases.  This system is required so that we may isolate and collect cells expressing specific antigens to test the efficacy of our therapeutic strategies without compromising their functionality or viability.  It is also important that the device protects the operators from being exposed to potentially infectious microbes.</p>
<p>The following salient characteristics apply to the autoMACS Pro Separator:<br />&bull;	Enable users to isolate or enrich cells expressing specific antigens that can be used for subsequent biological tests;<br />&bull;	Automated cell isolation with pre-programmed isolation protocols;<br />&bull;	Integrated computer with touch screen;<br />&bull;	Capable of automatically processing up to six (6) samples sequentially each with its own protocol;<br />&bull;	Uses biodegradable 50nm super-paramagnetic Microbeads (Iron) coated with a polysaccharide and present in a colloidal suspension to prevent clumping and clogging;<br />&bull;	Microbeads are directly conjugated to monoclonal antibodies directed against various antigens, fluorochromes, or avidin-biotin molecules;<br />&bull;	Allow users to collect specific cells depending on surface antigen expression from mice, tissue, or cell lines for assays without exposing the operators to potentially infectious microbes;<br />&bull;	Ability to enrich tumor cells expressing certain antigen, and used for antibody-targeting therapies; <br />&bull;	Patented columns: dual super-paramagnetic, bio-Teflon coated matrix columns - reusable over a 2-week period or up to 100 separations, whichever comes first.</p>
<p><br />PART II. Facts and Reasons To Justify Other than Full And Open Competition</p>
<p>1.	Statute: 13.106-1 (b)(1)</p>
<p>(b) Soliciting from a single source.</p>
<p>(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).</p>
<p><br />2.	Sole Source Justification</p>
<p>The Miltenyi Biotec autoMACS Pro separator is the only known system that can meet  the needs of the NCI.  The autoMACS Pro separator is already widely used throughout the NIH and NCI.  It has been cited in numerous scientific papers demonstrating its acceptance by the research community.  The autoMACS apparatus is only distributed by Miltenyi Biotec Inc.  The instrumentation and reagent content related to the autoMACS is proprietary and protected under patent rights and is thereby unavailable from any other sources.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM ET on July 31, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-80119-MM on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>This BAA solicitation seeks the development of a rapid HIV point-of-care diagnostic device for resource-limited settings (hereinafter referred to as rapid virus test.) The National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) seeks to fund a consortium of scientists, possessing a breadth of complementary skills and expertise in clinical HIV research. The consortium should additionally possess expertise with associated molecular technology, diagnostics, validation testing, GMP manufacturing, and project management, with the goal of developing a simple to use, rapid, point-of-care (POC) HIV diagnostic device. The device should possess candidate vaccine constructs and developed vaccine-induced antibodies in the absence of true HIV-1 infections and HIV-infected infants.  The diagnostic technology must demonstrate feasibility for use in resource-limited settings and in POC clinics without the use of supporting laboratory equipment. Examples of such equipment are centrifuges, vortexes and pipettes.  In addition, if proposed testing requires processing of patient samples for downstream applications, the processing must be self- contained, and require limited sample manipulation, and provide safe containment of potentially infectious material.  The optimal format is visual, without ambiguity, and includes a full process for negative and internal positive control.  

It is anticipated that 1 to 2 cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded on or about August 3, 2009 for a period of five years for the base period and options in years 3 and 4 for additional services; studies for a similar device to make limited treatment decisions based on viral load.  NIAID-DAIDS-BAA-NIHAI2008027 will be available electronically on or about August 1, 2008, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.  No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC><p>The U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intends to procure services for the purchase and installation of Network Equipment for a Redundant Failover Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) Web Site for the NOAA Fisheries Service, Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) in Miami, Florida. This procurement will be acquired in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations, Subpart 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. There is an existing website at the Southeast Regional Office (SERO) in St. Petersburg, Florida. The equipment purchased and installed as part of this procurement action will be installed at both the SEFSC and SERO. The resultant action will be a firm-fixed price contract/purchase order. The work involves the purchase, installation, and configuration of the network infrastructure hardware only. It does not involve the purchase, installation, or configuration of the web server hardware or software. Some coordination with the systems administrators responsible for installing the web server hardware will be required to ensure proper operation of the overall system. There are existing network infrastructures at both SERO and SEFSC. Therefore, specific hardware, software, and services are needed to implement the new system. These include items such as the, brand name or equal, having the following salient characteristics: CISCO Global Site Selector, GSS Version 2.0, Power Card 110V, SMARTNET 8X5XNBD Global Site Selector, GSS DDOS Software License, CISCO Application Control Engine (ACE) 4710 Hardware for Bundles, ACE 4710 BAS Bundle License, ACE Appliance SW 1.7A, Power Cord 110V, SMARTNET 8X5XNBD, ACE 4710 HW-1 Gbps-1K SSL 100MbpsComp 5VC. The SERO currently has a web site that supports an Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) system for the Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper Fishery. This is a real-time system used by commercial fishers and dealers to record the landings and the sales of Red Snapper in the States, within the United States, surrounding the Gulf of Mexico. The landing and sale of the Red Snapper cannot occur without entering the information into this system and getting the necessary approval codes. This system is critical to the Red Snapper Fishery; therefore, the SERO wants to create a redundant failover "hot site" at a different location (the SEFSC) in case the SERO site is inaccessible for any reason (e.g., extended power outage, hurricane, fire). There are currently two servers at the SERO. Part of the work is to install and configure the new network equipment to provide automatic failover from the primary server to the secondary server in the event of the primary server goes down. The SEFSC has an existing public -facing network infrastructure that will be used to support the network equipment and servers for the new IFQ hot site. The new network equipment that will be installed as part of this procurement action must be configured to first failover to the secondary server at the SERO in the event the primary server goes down or is not accessible. In the event neither the primary nor the secondary server at the SERO is functioning or accessible, the new equipment must be configured to automatically failover to the system located at the SEFSC. The systems should be configured to automatically restore service to the primary or secondary server at SERO when they become accessible and functional. Also, the equipment must be configured in any way necessary to support the database and application synchronization required between the IFQ servers at the two locations. The period of performance is sixty (60) calendar days. The Service Contract Act labor rates for the Miami-Dade County, Florida and Pinellas County, Florida areas are applicable to this procurement and can be accessed at http://www.wdol.gov/wagedeterminations. This is a total small business set-aside. NAICS code 423430 applies. The resultant procurement action will be firm-fixed price. The Central Region Acquisitions Division requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisitions Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR and ORCA, please access the following websites: http://www.ccr.gov/and http://orca.bpn.gov, respectively. In order to register in CCR and ORCA and to be eligible to receive an award for this acquisition office, all bidders must have a Dun and Bradstreet number.

The Request for Quotation can be accessed through Federal Business Opportunities website. Inquiries may be mailed to Mamie L. Wandick@noaa.gov or faxed to (816) 274-6962 or mailed to U. S.

Contractors are encouraged to register for the solicitation when downloading from the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website.  Only registered contractors will be notified by email when amendments to the solicitation are issued.  The magnitude of construction is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.  The anticipated scope of work may include, but is not limited to all labor, supervision, tools, materials, equipment, and transportation necessary to provide for the replacement of existing three-phase MIL-SPEC 24368 receptacles with new single-phase cam-lock receptacles on each pier.  The existing MIL-SPEC 24368 receptacles are part of assemblies referred to as "camel-backs".  The camelbacks will be removed and the pier patched as necessary.  The new receptacles will be part of new power station assemblies whose design will conform to the new NAVFAC criteria for dockside power stations.  The new receptacles will be at a different elevation than the existing, this will force low voltage (i.e. secondary) cable replacement back to the first manhole or handhole.  The circuits which feed the receptacles are composed of both copper and aluminum conductors.  This joining of dissimilar metals has caused corrosion at cable connections which has resulted in low voltage and in loss of power due to cable failure.  This project will replace aluminum cable with new copper cable as funds allow.  New receptacles will force the replacement of existing plugs on portable shore power cables owned by Port Operations and other users of the piers.  This project will provide and install, as necessary, new plugs compatible cam-lock receptacles onto existing cables.

TRANSITION NETWORKS BRAND NAME SOURCE STATEMENT
The Nuclear Reactor Supply Chain Management Directorate (NRSCMD), Code 87 of the Navy Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) maintains a Secure Network which currently consists of various components, including Transition Networks Network Interface Cards (NIC) and Fiber Optic Converters.  This purchase embraces Navy Standardization, which means that we will maintain consistency in the use of fiber optic equipment.  This purchase minimizes, if not virtually eliminating the learning curve associated with any new equipment.  A warranty provider for a single line ensures better service and lower costs.  From our experience, the reliability of Transition Networks Fiber NIC Cards and other fiber products exceeds that of other brands.  
Ease of administration:  Our technical personnel are very familiar with Transition Networks products.  This knowledge cuts down administration time, problem resolution, setup time, and also eliminates the need for various configurations.  Changing to another manufacturer would create an unnecessary increase in administration and support time.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services has a requirement for the acquisition of avian influenza H5N1 vaccine for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).  A key goal of the US Pandemic Preparedness Plan is to build sufficient stockpiles of pre-pandemic vaccine in order to immunize a 20 million member critical workforce prior to and at the onset of an influenza pandemic.   As part of a pandemic vaccine stockpile preparedness measure, the objective of this solicitation is to continue establishment and maintenance of an active and evolving U.S. stockpile of H5N1 vaccine for usage at the time a pandemic is declared. Therefore HHS wishes at this time to obtain H5N1 vaccine manufactured during the open window for seasonal influenza vaccine manufacturing using the U.S.-licensed commercial scale manufacturing process and facilities for seasonal trivalent egg-based inactivated influenza vaccines and the H5N1 virus seed stock derived from the virus reassortant of avian influenza H5N1 virus strain from the WHO list of recommended vaccine strains. HHS shall designate the specific virus strains for production by the Contractors.   The U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, through the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, contemplates single or multiple contract awards. Potential offerors must be able to manufacture an egg-based inactivated monovalent H5N1 vaccine at commercial scale using the same facilities, systems, equipment, and processes employed for their FDA-licensed seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine and using H5N1 virus reference strains prescribed by HHS. Bulk vaccines and bulk adjuvants shall be manufactured in the U.S. When an Offeror is going to use a manufacturing facility outside the U.S the bulk vaccine and adjuvant shall be shipped to the US as soon as the bulks are lot released and accepted. Formulation/fill/finish activities of vaccine and adjuvant shall be carried out in the U.S.  The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is for the acquisition of bulk vaccine product (15 micrograms per dose) to be formulated and filled into multi-dose vials, based on the availability of funds.  The minimum guarantee under this contract is 250,000 bulk antigen doses for the base year. Potential offerors must meet the following mandatory criteria:  1) hold an active U.S. license for seasonal inter-pandemic egg-based inactivated trivalent vaccine at the time of H5N1 vaccine bulk manufacturing); 2) successful experience in the bulk manufacturing of H5N1 vaccine at commercial scale using the licensed manufacturing process; and 3) bulk manufacturing facilities in compliance with current WHO biosafety guidelines for avian influenza vaccine manufacturing including BSL2+ enhanced biocontainment facilities and procedures.  The contract will include a one-year base period with 2 one-year option periods.   Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. RFP-BARDA-08-25 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about July 30, 2008. Proposals will be due on or about August 28, 2008.   The solicitation will utilize oral presentations for technical evaluation.  Cost proposals and other required information must be submitted in written format (see solicitation for requirements).  Any offeror who meet the mandatory requirements may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract or contracts.  This solicitation is being issued as full and open competition; however, small and small disadvantaged businesses are highly encouraged to participate in this acquisition.  Please note on your solicitation request your business size status.  Only written or email requests, directly from the requestor, for this solicitation will be accepted. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26. All responses should be identified with HHS-BARDA-08-25, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and should be submitted to the Contracting Office Address identified in this notice.

DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Command intends to negotiate with Dynamic Animations Systems, Inc. (DAS) 12015 Lee Jackson Highway, Suite 200, Fairfax, VA on a non-competitive basis (per FAR 6.302-1) a five-year cost contract to provide systems engineering, analysis, design, development, integration, test, and support of the Modeling Architecture for Technology Research and Experimentation (MATREX) Program.  The MATREX program provides the foundation for distributed modeling and simulation (M&S) environments employed to reduce program cost, schedule, and technical risk across the Army's acquisition programs.  MATREX provides a unifying M&S architecture, supporting tools, and infrastructure that ease the integration and use of multi-resolution live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) applications.   The purpose of this effort is to design, implement, and maintain a composable Modeling and Simulation (M&S) reference implementation. In addition, this effort requires the construction of modules and processes to test and integrate the architecture. The MATREX development requires in-depth knowledge of Army M&S development and systems engineering.<BR><BR>The RDECOM-AC determined full and open competition is not possible for the following reasons:<BR><BR>M&S interoperability authoring tools developed, supported, and maintained by DAS have created a dependent relationship where users require continued reliable products and support as the capabilities are not available elsewhere.  These interoperability authoring tools must be maintained and updated, in an on-going basis in order to evolve with changing customer needs while bridging interoperability between users.  <BR><BR>While the Government owns the technical data package (TDP) to the High Level Architecture (HLA) run-time infrastructure (RTI), it is updated and maintained by DAS, and is GFX to DoD entities. DAS is a key licensee of this data package maintaining special privileges including entitlement to make changes to HLA source code, support HLA users, fix flaws that may surface at on-going user events, further distribute HLA executable code (as updated by DAS) as GFX to other government entities, and support HLA (as updated by DAS) verification and validation. <BR><BR>DAS supplies the engineering capability to update, maintain, train, and configuration manage the GFX HLA RTI.  DAS MATREX engineering effort is the only commercial service that can sustain ongoing Government requirements using the GFX HLA RTI. <BR><BR>This is not a formal solicitation. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  All responsible sources other than DAS, Inc  may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Reference: W91CRB08R0103. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received, the acquisition will be awarded without further notice. Detailed capabilities, proposals, or quotations (with capability statements) must be received within 15 days after publication of this requirement; however, a determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Detailed capabilities, proposal, or quotes (with capability statements) must be submitted to the following email address within 15 days after the publication of this requirement. If no written responses are received, the requirement will be awarded without further notice.  Email your submissions to Nikia Jelks, Contract Specialist, RDECOM Acquisition Center - Aberdeen at nikia.s.jelks@us.army.mil.  The Procuring Contracting Officer for this action is Vanessa T. Dobson.  No telephone calls or faxes will be accepted.  No solicitation is available.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 541330.

<DESC>The USGS intends to award a requirement for the analysis of 47 egg samples and 25 plasma samples noncompetitively IAW FAR 13.106-1(b) (2) to Great Lakes Institute for Environmental Research of Windsor, ON Canada N9B 3 P4.  Ospreys are fish-eating birds at the top of the aquatic food web and have been used to evaluate contaminants in the environment of the Pacific Northwest periodically during the last 15 years.  Another series of eggs and blood plasma samples were collected in 2008.  These samples were collected at some of the same locations where Ospreys were evaluated in the past.  The task is to analyze the eggs and plasma using organochlorine scan, including PCB congeners (not co-planars).  Present data on wet weight basis and multiply wet weight residue concentration (only for eggs) by the adjustment factor provided for each egg.  This will yield a fresh wet weight concentration.  Analyze same samples for total mercury and present data on dry weight and wet weight basis (with wet weight mercury values for eggs also multiplied by adjustment factor provided for each egg).  QA/QC will be handled by the Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) and spiked samples will be used.  CWS QA/QC standards must be met.  Government will provide the egg contents and plasma of Ospreys for analysis.  Deliverables include hard copy and electronic spreadsheet of residue concentrations, with appropriate QA/QC report, i.e., must meet the standards of the Canadian Wildlife Service.  Schedule begins August 15, 2008 through November 1, 2008.  Contaminant studies require analytical specification, and when studies continue for multiple years or are regional in scope, there is a need to have consistency in the analytical chemistry so that trends and regional patterns can be detected without concern for inter-laboratory variability.  The samples collected in 2008 need to be analyzed under the same conditions and location where Osprey eggs were analyzed in 2007.  The eggs and fish samples were collected at the same study site.  There is a need to maintain consistency and comparability of analytical results for all specimen samples.  Other interested concerns shall submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting office no later than the closing date of this announcement.  Point of Contact is J. Stevenson (916) 278-9344 jstevenson@usgs.gov.  All submissions must demonstrate the ability to meet all requirements of the Statement of Work above.   This is not an RFQ; no written solicitation will be issued.

<DESC>The USGS intends to award a requirement for the analysis of 55 egg samples and 40 plasma samples noncompetitively IAW FAR 13.106-1(b) (2) to Carleton University/Dr. R. J. Letcher Ottawa, Ont Canada K1A OH3.  A paper, "Dacthal and chlorophenoxy herbicides and chlorothanlonil fungicides in eggs Osprey from the Duwamish-Lake Washington-Puget Sound area of Washington State, USA," recently appeared in Environmental Pollution 145 (2007): 374-381.  It documents the first report of herbicides in a bird egg.  An isomer of dacthal was also reported.  These findings indicate that dacthal can be accumulated in the food chain of fish-eating Osprey, and transferred in ova to eggs, and thus may be of concern to the health of the developing chick and the general reproductive health of the Osprey populations.  Polybrominated biphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were also found in the Osprey eggs.  This new work is part of a series.  The analytical chemistry work has been conducted by Dr. Robert Letcher and associates.  A new technique was developed.  Thus, for comparability, the egg and plasma samples will be analyzed at the same lab.  The contractor will analyze 55 eggs and up to 40 plasma samples for selected herbicides and PBDEs.  The government will provide the eggs and plasma.  Deliverables include analysis of 55 eggs and up to 40 plasma samples.  The findings will be presented on electronic spreadsheets, with appropriate QA/QC, i.e., will meet the standards of the Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS).  The schedule will commence August 30, 2008 and end December 30, 2008.Residue data must meet the QA/QC standards of the CWS.  Other interested concerns shall submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting office no later than the closing date of this announcement.  Point of Contact is J. Stevenson (916) 278-9344 jstevenson@usgs.gov.  All submissions must demonstrate the ability to meet all requirements of the Statement of Work above.   This is not an RFQ; no written solicitation will be issued.

<DESC>This is notice of intent to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to SOC LLC, 2393 Heyborne Road, Minden NV 89423-8906 under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, to provide pre-mission training at Hawthorne Army Depot, Hawthorne, NV during the period 10 September to 15 October 2008. The information received to support this sole source reveals that the environment in the Hawthorne, NV area closely resembles that of Afghanistan, consequently providing the most realistic training environment for these soldiers. Further, HQ, Army Sustainment Command issued a no-cost agreement to SOC LLC for sole use of the ranges on Hawthorne Army Depot. This agreement limits the use of the ranges to provide training to soldiers to SOC LLC only. This notice is not a request for offers. The anticipated date of award is 2 Aug 08. Because of the inability of any other contractor to obtain authority to train on these ranges, and because it is necessary for the soldiers to train during this period and in this environment, the contractor identified is the only known source for the subject requirement. Responses to this notice will be used to determine if bona fide competition exists to provide pre-mission training at Hawthorne Army Depot. Any such responses must be in writing and include documents that clearly demonstrate the ability to train on the Hawthorne Army Depot and have full use of the installation ranges and other facilities. The training shall include improvised explosive training, counter-ambush training, quick reaction force training, full mission profile training, dismounted and mounted live fire training and three final training exercise evolutions. The contractor shall provide knowledgeable instructors, vehicles, classrooms, tents, chairs, tables, pneumatic steel target range with moving targets, communications equipment, weapons with ammunition, role players with Afghanistan-like clothing, maintenance, repair, and trash removal. All responses from responsible sources will be fully considered; however, determination to compete or not to compete this requirement is solely at the discretion of the Government. No extensions will be granted. The Government will not pay for any information submitted. Only electronic submissions will be accepted. No telephone responses will be accepted. The point of contact for this requirement is Ms.  Ella Porter, Contract Specialist, e-mail: portere@soc.mil.

<DESC><p>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), the Department of Defense (DoD) Medical School and Health Sciences University, hereby announces its intent to acquire on a sole source basis with Biomedic Data Systems, Inc. in Seaford, Delaware for four implantable identification systems, DAS-6001 Console Systems for the Armed Forces Radiobiological Research Institute (AFRRI).
<p>The systems will be used to identify and record the body temperature of rodents, non-human primates and other animals within the vivarium. The Biomedic Data Systems console system allows animal identification and body temperature assessment via a subcutaneously-injected transponder chip. The detection system allows for identification and temperature measurements to be made within close proximity to the animal and also through the plastic micro-isolater cages. This allows for data collection with minimal disturbance to the animal.</p>
<p>The Biomedic Data System's Console System is unique in that it allows for individual identification of each animal and the body temperature via an easily injected transponder chip. The system also allows for collection of body weight and other linked measurements and set parameters. In addition, this system is currently an existing system being used by other investigators within AFRRI, both Non-Human Primate and Rodent current and past protocols.</p>
<p>This award is IAW FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1) and authorizes USUHS to award contracts when only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. All inquires may be addressed to Nadine Utz, 4301 Jones Bridge Road, Room A1040C, Bethesda, MD 20814-4799 by 23 July 2008 at 3:00 p.m. EST.</p>

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard Research & Development Center intends to negotiate and award a sole-source fixed price contract to the Smithsonian Institute (SI) of Washington, DC to determine an instrument-specific threshold limit for chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) that will be used to verify ballast water exchange.  The study must measure the CDOM content of a large number of shipboard and port samples from a broad range of geographic locations, ballasted conditions, and environmental backgrounds.  These include samples from fully exchanged, partially exchanged, and unexchanged ballast tanks, oceanic water (more than 200 nautical miles from shore), and port water that ranges from high salinity to low salinity. The study must also investigate and account for matrix effects that intensify or attenuate the signal of the samples relative to the calibration standard.  The Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC), a branch of SI will conduct this work.  SERC maintains the only extant database of chemical tracers, including CDOM at the specific wavelength pair of interest and has conducted multivariate analyses on the data.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement to the above address.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement(s).  To be eligible for award, offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR): www.ccr.gov. For information concerning the acquisition, contact the contracting official listed above.  See notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>Department of Veterans Affairs Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) CenterNorthern California Health Care System (NCHCS)  City of Martinez State of California Project No. 612-905Estimated Price Range is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  Design-Build. Competitive Negotiated Acquisition (Source Selection) (IAW FAR Part 15.3)RFP to be issued electronically at FBO Website RFP Issue Date: 31 July 2008 Proposal Due Date: 31 August 2008 Scope of Work:  Work includes the construction for a new building in accordance with the design drawings and specifications.Narrative of Building SystemsArchitectural Exterior:This two-story building has two main points of entry. One entry is at grade level from the existing CREC building and the second is the main visitor's entry from the adjacent parking lot. The exterior materials are similar to the CREC: stucco 5:12 roof pitch- standing seam metal roof, window bays along the east side match the window bays of the existing patient rooms. The curved wall is a unique feature to this building; the wall has a masonry veneer finish similar to masonry on other campus buildings. The covered walkways have similar proportions to the covered breezeway connecting to the main entrance of the CREC. An enclosed walkway connects the Shasta wing to the ground floor gym entry and a roof-covered walkway connects to the existing Tahoe wing. Another distinctive feature is the curtain wall design enclosing the two story gym space.Our goals in shaping the roof form include simplifying the truss layout, complimenting the curved wall on the west and reflect the CREC roof shape on the east side of the building. Solar Tubes are incorporated along the main corridor axis of the second floor to bring natural light into the center of the building, reducing lighting loads.Architectural Interior:The quality of this space at the main entry and the gym sets the tone for the Veteran's experience in their recovery. We designed this space as the centerpiece for the user whether they enter at the second level reception area or at the first level gym. The connecting stairway is glass enclosed with a locking vestibule to provide security to the second floor during non-office hours.Building Site:Another significant feature of the building form that responds to the limits of the building site is the exterior west wall. This wall curves to follow the sidewalk bend along the parking area. To take advantage of the sloping grade, the lower level exterior west wall is offset by 8 feet. This offset is a significant design element because it eliminates the need for a full height (11 feet) retaining wall for the entire length of the 160 foot building; that's a lot of concrete! The building section illustrates this concept.Preliminary Soils Report:On June 27, 2008 the soils engineer drilled five test borings at the site. One boring was located roughly at each of the four corners of the planned roughly rectangular shaped building and the fifth boring was located near the center of the proposed building footprint. For purposes of this narrative, I refer the borings at the corners nearest the existing Shasta Building as the "lower borings", the borings at the other two corners of the building (drilled from the shoulder of the existing road/parking area) as the "upper borings" and the boring at the center of the building as the "center boring". All borings encountered severely to completely weathered sandstone and/or siltstone bedrock materials at depths of less then 8 feet. The sandstone was relatively weaklycemented, but is very dense (blow counts in excess of 50 for 3 inch penetration). In the lower borings the top of weathered rock was encountered at a depth of approximately 3 to 4 feet and was overlain by relatively dense sandy soils. In the middle boring the sandstone was encountered at a depth of about 2 feet. The upper borings were drilled just off the road shoulder and encountered approximately 5 to 6 feet of fill soils. The weathered bedrock material was encountered at a depth of approximately 7 to 8 feet in the upper borings. The fill appears to be moderately well compacted and is compromised of a mixture of yellow brown sand and dark brown silty to sandy clay.Based on the borings, the materials underlying the site are relatively competent and suitable for the new building construction. In my opinion the new building can be supported either on conventional spread footings founded in the weathered rock layer or on drilled piers. Preliminary architectural plans show the building benched partially into the hillside. Cuts within the building footprint should expose competent material and I would expect a temporary cut slope of 1:1 (20 feet or less in height) made during the dry weather period would be reasonable. Conventional building retaining wall pressures are anticipated. It is assumed the walls will be designed with back drains to limit hydro static forces.Soils/weathered rock anticipated at slab level are not anticipated to be expansive andconventional slab-on-grade construction is anticipated to be acceptable.For seismic design in accordance with the 2006 IBC/2007 CBC we will likely be recommending a Type C profile.  Structural system:   The foundation for the building will be grade beams resting on drilled piers or a spread foundation depending on the geotechnical report recommendations. The depth of the footing and piers will be established by the geotechnical report. Concrete strengths would be in the range of 3000 to 4000 psi at 28 days. The structural frame for the building is expected to be a steel beams and columns, braced by a concentrically braced frame system for seismic & wind lateral loading.  Interior partitions and exterior wall framing will be steel studs. The floor and roof system will be a composite concrete and steel deck system. We do not recommend the use of a plain metal deck for the roof diaphragm.Mechanical System:  Mechanical System for the building consists of split DX system with high efficiency condensing unit outdoors and high efficiency condensing gas furnace indoor unit. Dehumidification unit for the lap-pool room shall be a split system with remote condenser. Dehumidification system shall be designed to preclude condensation in the lap-pool room. Equipment shall be high efficiency and shall be capable of providing minimum two LEED credits under Optimize Energy Performance and one LEED credit under Enhanced Refrigerant Management. Toilet exhaust fan shall be provided for the Men/Women rooms with minimum 10 air changes per hour. Building management system shall be direct digital controls extended from existing hospital controlsystem.Electrical System: The project will provide feeder trenching, conduits, and transformer for the new service for the new two-story medical office building. The main building switchgear will feed 480Y/277 volt distribution panels. The distribution panels will feed dry type 480-208/120 volt transformer located in the electrical room. These transformers will feed 208Y/120 volt secondary distribution panels. A complete wiring system will be provided to distribute power to all equipment and devices, including receptacles, lighting fixtures, elevators, mechanical equipment, and etc. Grounding system will be designed in accordance with CEC article 250 and will be based on equi-potential grounding with voice/data system bonded to the building ground system. A complete lighting system shall be provided for the building. Indoor lighting shall consist primarily of energy-efficient fluorescent fixtures. In general, indoor lighting will be controlled by lighting control system and room occupancy sensors. Emergency/night lighting will be provided by unswitched branch circuits. These unswitched branch circuits will be fed from emergency lighting panels.PVC conduits will be run from the service provider duct banks to the Main Voice/Data Equipment Room (VDER). The voice data system will consist of wall outlets in all building spaces and connected to the nearest VDER via a single conduit.Fire alarm system shall be electronically multiplexed voice communication system matching existing VA fire alarm system. Remote transponder panels will be used to provide supervised amplifiers and signal circuits for audio/video devices and magnetic door holders. The system will utilize individual addressable photoelectric smoke detectors, addressable manual pull stations and addressable monitor and control modules. The system will monitor all sprinkler supervisory and water flow switches and shall interface with elevators, HVAC smoke control and smoke fire dampers.Plumbing System: Potable hot and cold water shall be provided for Men/Women rooms, examination rooms,laboratories, showers, and miscellaneous sinks throughout the building.

Introduction and Scope of WorkBack and Neck injuries produce a considerable amount of lost employee time in any organization.  This project requires development and implementation of Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) for the treatment of lower back and neck-related injuries, as well as research studies to determine the effectiveness of those CPGs.  A Program Advisory board will be established consisting of the following:	VA NYHHS STAFF:	Principle Coordinator	Project Coordinator	Occupational Health Staff:		Chief, Personnel Health, New York Campus		Workers' Compensation Program Manager, New York Campus		Chair, Ergonomics Program, Brooklyn Campus		Physical Therapist		Psychologist		Data Manager	CONTRACT STAFF:		Medical Advisor		Psychologist		Epidemiologist		Research Physical Therapist		Advisory Board MembershipThis board will discuss the scope and content of the project, and reach consensus on the best way to implement the project.  The project will be conducted in two phases.  The first phase will encompass development of CPGs for Lower Back Pain and Neck-Related pain, based on evidence-based medicine combined with best practice recommendations, utilizing updated literature review, current evidence-based treatments (EBTs) and the experience of the contracted group.  Implementation of these CPGs will take place in Phase II.  Data will be collected during these phases to address research questions regarding the effectiveness of the CPG in terms of employee return to duty statistics.2.	Requirementsa.	Timeliness RequirementsAll components of the project will be completed within the 2008 and 2009 Fiscal Years.b.	Reporting RequirementsProgress will be reported via the Program Advisory Board regarding the creation of CPGs, clinician training, implementation of the CPGs and subsequent research activities to validate the efficacy of the CPG to Senior Management, VA NYHHS.c.	Documentation RequirementsA Manual of Operations and Procedures (MOOP) will be produced that will include recommendations for implementation, test batteries and evaluation protocols, algorithms for treatment, referral triage and supporting materials for patient and healthcare provider education.  Additionally, a website will be developed which will include web-based training (as outlined in the MOOP).  The treatment protocols contained in the MOOP will most likely include Clinical Examination and Evidence-Based Interventions (exercise, ergonomics and psychological).  Once the MOOP is completed, reviewed and approved, it will provide a detailed plan for training healthcare providers and administrative staff in the procedures of clinical practice and data collection.  A feasibility study will be provided at the completion of the training to evaluate ease of implementation and quality control.  To accommodate Transfer of Knowledge, reports summarizing the CPGs and results from the pilot study will be submitted to NY Harbor Executive Management and VA Central Office.d.	Workload DataThe CPGs will be utilized on all injured employees presenting to the Employee Health Services at the Brooklyn and New York campuses for Lower Back and Neck-Related Injuries in the six months following the implementation of the CPG intervention.e.	Facility DataThe contractor will require access to Employee Health records in order to compare the period six months after the intervention of the CPGs with data from the six months previous.  This will be accomplished once all VA Information Security and Privacy regulations have been met, as described in section j below.f.	Place of PerformanceInitial meetings of the Program Advisory Board will take place at the VA NYYHS.  Member research/individual work assignments can be performed at any location convenient for the Board Member.  Phase II will be accomplished at the Employee Health Services at both the New York and Brooklyn campuses of VA NYHHS.  Analysis of records for employee visits in the six months previous to the intervention of CPGs can be accomplished remotely, following all VA NYHHS Information Security and Privacy regulations.  Physicians can complete their training remotely through the website mentioned in section c.g.	Procedure for Referral and SchedulingEmployees presenting at the Brooklyn or New York campus of VA NYYHS will be evaluated and referred to the project by the Occupational Health Staff in the Employee Health Services.h.	Transfer of PatientsNot applicablei.	Employee SafetyThe current safety policy within the facility includes, but is not limited to, Environment of Care.  See Section 3, References.j.	Exchange of DataThe data compiled in this project is considered sensitive, containing personal information on VA NYHHS employees, and will be protected following all applicable VA Information Security and Privacy regulations, as listed in section 3, References.Contractor staff requesting access to employee records must complete Information Security training and Privacy training and evidence of the implementation of a background check.  Additionally, consideration must be made to protect the data itself.  The contractor must present a data exchange solution that will contain the data within the VA environment.  The Research Checklist will be used to ensure that data is secured.  Any and all applicable documents regarding protection of data/data exchange/release of information will be completed prior to IRB and R&D review.k.	Billing: TBDl.	Payments: TBDm.	Penalty for Non-PerformanceNon-performance of the terms of this Statement of Work will result in termination of services.n.	Reimbursement Method: TBDo.	Educational and Research ActivitiesOnce the CPGs are defined, training will take place via the website mentioned in section c.  The website will provide general information for all healthcare providers as well as specific topics for all specialists as outlined in the MOOP.  The web-based program will offer a computer scored test section so that participants can track their progress and the effectiveness of the training can be assessed.  The website will also facilitate communication and information exchange among healthcare providers.  Upon approval of the MOOP, the contractor will provide a detailed plan for training VA healthcare providers and administrative staff in the procedures of clinical practice and data collection.  This training will follow established training protocols and will include education sessions and practical training by the contracted staff.  The Epidemiologist will work with a dedicated VA employee to set up and maintain a database for ongoing feedback and research.  The database will be stored and managed in a secure VA-based website platform.Upon completion of the training, a feasibility study will be conducted to evaluate success of implementation and quality control.  A subsequent pilot study will then be run to test the efficacy of the CPGs, implementing a concurrent, quasi-experimental, controlled trial.  In this proposed trial, outcomes at the NY campus, using the CPGs will be compared with outcomes at the Brooklyn campus, using current practices.  Approval of the protocol by the VA NYHHS IRB and R&D Committees will be required before the project can begin.The trial will be designed to test the following research questions:1.	Compared to the control site, the intervention site will have a greater decrease in total days lost to injury in the six months following implementation of the intervention versus the same six month period in the previous year.2.	Compared to the control site, the injured employees at the intervention site will have a shorter average recovery time (mean days out of work).3.	Compared to the control site, injured employees at the intervention site will have a higher rate of return to full duty (lower rate of limited or light duty).4.	Compared to the control site, injured employees at the intervention site will have greater satisfaction with the process and outcomes of care.5.	Psychosocial and clinical characteristics of injured employees at initial presentation will predict time to recovery, return to full duty and satisfaction.The study population will be all injured employees presenting to Employee Health Services at the two study sites (clinical campuses at VA NYHHS) in the six months following implementation of the CPG intervention, compared with those presenting in the six month period before implementation.  The same calendar period will be used in order to control for potential seasonal variation in occupational injury and recovery experiences.At the initial presentation to Employee Health Services for an occupational injury, all staff will complete a standardized questionnaire that addresses the nature of the injury and symptoms, their demographic characteristics, and a psychological profile using validated instruments that have been linked to outcomes in musculoskeletal injury.Employees at the Brooklyn campus will be evaluated and managed based on current policies and strategies, at the discretion of the clinical staff.  At the New York campus, evaluation and management will be guided by the CPG and relevant training implemented in the pilot.The outcome variables to be collected and analyzed are:Total days lost to work due to injury over six months (two quarters) at each site.  This data is routinely collected at VA in the ASSIST database and reported in aggregate, sorted by clinical campus, to the Safety Committee.Total days lost to work due to injury over the same six months (two quarters) period in the previous calendar year at each site.Recovery time: number of days lost to injury for each injured employee during the first six months following implementation.  This outcome is tracked by Employee Health Service staff at each campus by clinical or telephone follow-up with injured employees.  Time to return to work will be confirmed with each employee's supervisor.Return to full duty following injury: Work status (full, limited, or light duty) at three and six months following injury will be tracked by Employee Health Service staff at each campus by clinical or telephone follow-up with injured employees.  Work status will be confirmed with each employee's supervisor.Satisfaction: Satisfaction with the process and outcomes of care will be assessed via questionnaire among all injured employees at each campus, six months following initial presentation for injury.The Analysis Plan will test the five hypotheses:Hypothesis #1 will be tested by analysis of covariance, comparing total days lost to work due to injury at intervention vs. control sites, adjusted for differences in baseline rates in the prior year.  A paired t-test will also be used to compare change in total days lost to work at intervention vs. control sites.Hypothesis #2 will be tested using t-tests to compare mean days out of work at intervention vs. control sites.Hypothesis #3 will be tested using chi-square tests to compare the rate of return to full duty (vs. limited or light duty) at intervention vs. control sites.Hypothesis #4 will be assessed using chi-square and t-tests as appropriate to the data to compare satisfaction at intervention vs. control sites.Hypothesis #5 will be assessed using multivariate regression models of baseline characteristics predictive of time to recovery, return to full duty, and satisfaction.  Predictive variables will be considered for the regression models based on the strength of their bivariate association with each outcome (p<0.1 required for consideration).  Linear and logistic regression will be used as appropriate to the nature of the outcome being modeled.The major threats to validity in this trial will be the non-blinded nature of the intervention, and outcome assessment.  The impact of potential measurement bias will be limited by the objective nature of most of the outcome variables.  The primary outcome, total days lost to work, will be assessed via administrative data collected independently of allocation status.  In addition, work status outcomes will be confirmed with employee's supervisors.  Selection bias will be limited by adjusting comparisons of outcomes by differences in baseline variables (employee characteristics) and by historical rates for hypothesis #1.The return on investment (ROI) of the intervention will be assessed by determining the ratio of incremental cost to incremental efficacy in reduced time lost to work at intervention compared with control sites (dollars per day saved).  If the proposed intervention is efficacious, the ROI analysis will help justify scaling up the program for larger-scale testing of effectiveness at more sites (for example, across an entire VISN)3.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Marshall Space Flight Center(MSFC) is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for its Ares ElectricThrust Vector Control (TVC) Prototype Risk Reduction System requirement.NASAs Constellation Program is the mission support architecture that will replace theSpace Shuttle.	One component of the Constellation Program is the Ares family of launchvehicles.  The Ares launch vehicles will utilize the heritage reusable solid rocketbooster currently in use on the Space Shuttle system for propulsive boost during theascent to orbit.  The reusable solid rocket booster currently uses a distributedhydraulic, hydrazine powered thrust vector control (TVC) system that is used to move thesolid rocket nozzle and effect launch vehicle steering during ascent.  This heritage TVChas proven extremely reliable and has exceeded all technical requirements during theoperational life of the Space Shuttle system.  However, due to high life cycle costs,burdensome logistics requirements at the launch site, and use of hazardous hypergolicfuel, NASA is seeking an alternative simplified TVC system architecture that willeffectively reduce the overall life cycle cost and launch site processing requirements.One such design solution is an electric TVC architecture.  It is anticipated that theelectric solution will be comprised of three primary subcomponents:    Two (2) actuatorsdriven by electric motors, a motor control and power modulation unit, and a set ofrechargeable batteries.  It is envisioned that this system could be assembled and testedat a contractor facility, shipped to the launch site and integrated into the launchvehicle with minimal follow-on testing, thereby reducing the logistics at the launch siteand ultimately reducing overall life cycle costs.  Current state of the art in TVCapplications for manned launch vehicles have not, as yet, incorporated an electricarchitecture, and where it has been implemented for unmanned vehicles, the power flowcapabilities are well below the anticipated requirements for the Ares family solid rocketbooster.  Anticipated actuator mechanical power flow requirements for the solid rocketbooster exceed sixty (60) horsepower.  Additionally, the solid rocket booster missionduty cycle requirements will require state of the art rechargeable batteries achievingboth high power delivery capability and achieve high power densities.Prior to committing to flight system development of an electric TVC system, NASA will tryto effectively reduce and mitigate the significant development risk by contracting forthe design, development and construction of a prototype electric TVC system that willaddress the technical feasibility of the electric design concept.  The selectedcontractor would be responsible for tailoring a risk reduction program that addressesanticipated forward development technical risks such as:  thermal management of highpower electrics, corona discharge at reduced pressures in the presence of high voltages,qualification of power semiconductor components and development of high power flow andhigh power density rechargeable batteries.  The developed non-flight, prototype systemwill then be thoroughly tested by the contractor to assess the technical feasibility ofcontinuing on to flight system development.  The data obtained from this risk reductionproject may then be used to determine the optimum design solution for the Ares solidrocket booster.  It is anticipated that the period of performance for this requirementwill be approximately eighteen (18) months.Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet theabove requirement should submit a capability statement indicating the ability to performall aspects of the effort described herein.  Responses should be limited to theinformation requested in this sources sought notice and submissions shall not exceed 15pages in length.  Responses must include the following:  1) name and address of firm; 2)size of business; 3) average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; 4)ownership; 5) whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/orwoman-owned; 6) number of years in business; 7) affiliate information:	parent company,joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub)or subcontractors (if potential prime); 8) a description of your current design,development and test capability of aerospace electric actuation systems; 9) a descriptionof your past performance and experience that resulted in aerospace qualified designs andexperience in the up screening of electrical components to meet manned space flightrequirements; 10) list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant workperformed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and pointof contact - address and phone number); and 11) a description of your current design,development and test capability of high power flow and high power density rechargeablebatteries for use on aerospace vehicles.  Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-typeproduct.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101.Technical questions should be directed to:  David Wagner, telephone: 256-544-6337,e-mail: David.K.Wagner@nasa.gov.  Procurement related questions should be directed to:Sarah Annerton, telephone: 256-544-8429, e-mail: Sarah.D.Annerton@nasa.gov.This sources sought notice is for information and planning purposes and is not to beconstrued as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for informationsolicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation forthe requirement.  A solicitation does not exist at this time; therefore, do not request acopy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized inFedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerorsresponsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<DESC>The U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MMS), solicits White Papers, of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the MMS Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program, Oil Spill Response Research (OSRR).   The MMS web site has descriptions of OSRR activities, the scope of MMS interests, and past projects.  The web site address is www.mms.gov/tarphome.  Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting White Papers.  BACKGROUND: The OSRR and Decommissioning Research sponsored by the MMS through the TA&R Program is directly integrated into MMS's offshore operations and is used in making regulatory decisions pertaining to permit and plan approvals, safety and pollution inspections, enforcement actions, and training requirements.  MMS proposes to expand its existing OSRR program consistent with our statutory responsibility and the provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  As oil and gas industry activities increase in the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico and the ice-infested Beaufort Sea of Alaska, research must be broadened to address unknown factors concerning mechanical equipment performance and reliability as well as alternative countermeasures that include chemical treating agents including dispersants, in situ burning and submerged oils. The principal objective of this request for White Papers is to address innovative or technological advancements among topics of current interest to MMS. As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals shall be requested.  Projects selected for eventual funding by MMS shall receive funding from fiscal year (FY) 2009 funds. Note that funding is not currently available for the project.  The MMS anticipates a total of up to one million dollars ($1,000,000) may be available for the initiation of new OSR research proposals addressing OSRR topics and $200,000 may be available for decommissioning in FY 2009 with projects being identified through this announcement. Typical projects envisioned to address the topics set forth below may require up to one man-year effort and cost up to $250,000.  Projects spanning multiple years will also be considered.  Prospective offerors shall bear this in mind when responding to this request.  NOTICE: The MMS may share the White Paper submissions with other organizations for review.  Potential contractors should let MMS know if they do not want the White Papers shared outside the MMS.  The MMS anticipates awards resultant to this announcement will be made on a firm fixed-price basis.  OBJECTIVES: The topics for the FY 2009 OSRR activities include ONLY research related to the following:
Topic 1:  Less Destructive Shoreline Flushing TechniquesOne of the goals in spill response is to minimize harm to the environment and shorten the time for recovery.  Past experience has shown that aggressive shoreline flushing methods can harm the environment and slow recovery.  The MMS is seeking White Papers on new and/or innovative technologies that will improve existing shoreline flushing equipment techniques and methodologies so that they are more effective, less invasive, and minimize destruction to the environment.  This could include full-scale prototypes, non-commercially available technologies, and/or adaptations of existing technologies.  
Topic 2:  In Situ Burn Residue CleanupPhysical properties of burn residues depend on burn efficiency and oil type.  Efficient burns of heavy crude oils generate brittle, solid residues. Residues from burns of thick crude oil slicks are more likely to sink than residues from burns of thin slicks of the same crude oils, because higher-molecular weight compounds concentrate in the residue as the burn progresses.  Results of laboratory tests suggest the possibility that, for about 40 to 60% of crude oils worldwide, burn residues may sink.  Only a very short time window is available for surface recovery of residues that eventually sink, but this recovery option could be effective, since residues are readily recovered either manually or with sorbents. Once the residue sinks, recovery options are few, logistics-intensive, and ineffective.  The MMS is seeking White Papers that would use laboratory scale or meso-scale experiments, spills of opportunity, or other innovative methods to develop new or improve existing equipment, techniques or methodologies to improve the collection and recovery of in situ burn residue.
Topic 3:  Characteristics, Behavior, and Response Effectiveness of Spilled Dielectric FluidsThe Alternative Energy/Alternative Use program includes the placing of potentially dozens of Electrical Service Platform (ESP) on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf.  Electrical cables run from individual wave, current, wind, or other type of alternative energy generation devices to the ESP where the electricity is changed in voltage by large transformers. Each of these transformers contains thousands of gallons of dielectric fluid, often a mineral oil, sometimes other types of fluids such as those made from soy beans.  There is no specific knowledge of the response options available to cleanup a spill of dielectric fluids on the marine environment.  The MMS is seeking White Papers that will provide a literature review and scientific information (including European sources) on the characteristics, behavior (once spilled) and window of opportunity for using all response options for cleaning up spilled dielectric fluids in the marine environment.  Recommendations shall include a test program including different wave conditions to study the behavior of spilled dielectric fluids and their ability to be contained with boom and recovered mechanically, recovered using existing sorbents, their ability to be dispersed using existing chemical dispersants, and their ability to be removed through the use of in situ burning.  
Topic 4:  Identification of Window of Opportunity for Chemical Dispersants on Outer Continental Shelf Crude OilsIn a previously MMS funded research project entitled: Identification of Window of Opportunity for Chemical Dispersants on Gulf of Mexico Crude Oils http://www.mms.gov/tarprojects/595.htm, the objective was to develop best-fit correlations between readily available fresh oil properties and the window of opportunity for successful chemical dispersant use using data from Gulf of Mexico (GOM) crude oils.  Two models were developed that predicted the window of opportunity for dispersant use for 1,000 and 10,000 barrel spill scenarios.  The MMS is seeking White Papers that will validate both models using oil property data from sources outside of the US GOM and/or from new analyses of crude oils from the US GOM to verify that the trends identified in this study are valid when applied to data independent from those used to develop the correlations. Ideally, data on oil behavior and dispersibility of oils from large tank tests or field spills should be used to validate both the spill modeling results and the oil dispersibility criteria used in this study.
Topic 5:  Equipment to Less Destructively Access Marsh EnvironmentsOne of the goals in near shore oil spill response is to minimize harm to the environment and shorten the time for recovery.  Past experience has shown that oil spill response operations in marsh lands can harm the environment and slow the recovery process.  The MMS is seeking White Papers on new and /or innovative technologies that will provide access to isolated marshy areas without damaging or destroying the environment.  This could include full-scale prototypes, non-commercially available technologies, and/or adaptations of existing technologies.  
Topic 6:  Chemical Treating Agents and Dispersants for Use in Fresh and Brackish Water The MMS is seeking White Papers that will provide a literature review and scientific information (including European sources) on the use of chemical treating agents and dispersants in fresh and brackish water. 
Topics 7-9 Relate to Ohmsett - The National Oil Spill Response Test FacilityOhmsett - the National Oil Spill Response Test Facility located in Leonardo, New Jersey.  Ohmsett is a large outdoor above ground concrete test tank that measures 667 feet long by 65 feet wide by 11 feet deep.  It is filled with 2.6 million gallons of crystal clear salt water, has a wave generator capable of generating 3-foot high waves and a moveable bridge that spans the tank capable of towing equipment at speeds of 6.5 knots, while state-of-the art data and video date is collected above and below the waters surface.  Information on Ohmsett can be found on the website at www.ohmsett.com.  It is the intention of the MMS to reserve a block of time at the Ohmsett test facility to test the technologies and/or devices in the below topics.  The MMS is in effect, looking for `self-nomination of technologies and/or devices to test during these time frames.  The MMS will pay for all the expenses associated with operation of the Ohmsett facility.  Owners/operators would be responsible for any additional expenses.
Topic 7:  Ohmsett Testing of Technologies to Detect, Locate and/or Recover Submerged and Sunken OilSeveral large sills have occurred in rivers and the open ocean over the past few years that involved thousands of gallons of submerged and sunken oil.  The MMS is seeking White Papers on new and /or innovative technologies that will detect, locate, and/or recover submerged and sunken oil.  This could include full-scale prototypes, non-commercially available technologies, and/or adaptations of existing technologies.  The MMS seeks to test and evaluate these technologies on a simulated ocean bottom that will be constructed at Ohmsett.  American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations.
Topic 8:  Ohmsett Testing of Mechanical Technologies to Contain and Recover Oil Spills in Broken IceExploratory, development and production drilling will continue to increase in the Arctic.  Mechanical containment and recovery of oil spills is the primary response option in U.S. territorial waters.  It is important that the MMS know the window of opportunity for the use of mechanical response equipment in broken ice conditions to effectively review oil spill response plans.  The MMS is seeking White Papers on new and /or innovative technologies that will contain and/or recover oil in broken ice conditions.  This could include full-scale prototypes, non-commercially available technologies, and/or adaptations of existing technologies.  The MMS seeks to test and evaluate these technologies in a simulated broken ice environment that will be constructed at Ohmsett. Tests could be conducted in static and advancing modes.  ASTM testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations.
Topic 9:  Ohmsett Testing of Wave Energy TechnologiesThe MMS is seeking White Papers on new and /or innovative technologies for wave energy systems.  These include point source buoys that capture energy from wave movement.  Another general type of device is a tethered or moored segmented serpentine system known as a wave attenuator.  This type of device undulates in passing waves, whereby energy is captured at the joints of the segments.  Included also are devices that extract energy from water currents.  These devices usually employ some type of turbine or paddle wheel and operate at of near the surface.  Ideally, these would be devices whose dynamic reaction can be reasonably modeled by towing.  The MMS seeks to test and evaluate these technologies in a wave environment at Ohmsett.  ASTM testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations.
Topic 10:  Decommissioning: Fixed and Floating Oil and Gas Platform Removal and DispositionReview the state of the art for removal of Gulf of Mexico U.S. Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas facilities in over 600 feet water depth.  Focus research on the technical capabilities and practicality of removing the large facilities and the various disposition alternatives.  Include the potential to reef portions, such as spar hulls that had no hydrocarbon storage, either in place or in designated planning areas.  Include the decommissioning costs.

<DESC>The government is seeking sources to for the procurement and installation of ballistic protection for target mechanisms on the High Risk Personnel (HRP) Course ranges at MCB Quantico Virginia.  The existing structures are constructed of wood, steel and railroad ties and have been in place for several years.  All existing protective structures are worn and have outlived their useful service life and must be removed and replaced.
The contractor will be required to remove the existing wooden protective wall and install a protective wall made of ballistic rubber blocks or like material on Bay 2 to protect the target mechanisms.  Two walls three feet high and approximately 45 feet in length with a thickness necessary to defeat service rifle, 7.62mm and below, and pistol, .45 caliber ammunition and below are required.  Machine guns will not be used on this range.  The walls must be free standing and have no ricochet producing materials on the facing surfaces.  Steel backing is not required on these two walls.
On Bay 3, the contractor will be required to remove existing wooden protective structures and install three free-standing protective walls made of ballistic rubber blocks backed with 3/8 AR 500 steel.  The purpose of the protective walls is to prevent damage to target mechanisms already installed on the range.  The replacement protective walls will need to be of a thickness to be able to defeat ammunition from weapons of 7.62 service rifle and below and service pistol of .45 caliber and below.  No machine guns will be used on this range.  The first required ballistic wall will be an L shaped wall 50 inches wide at the base and 64 inches tall on the left side.  The tall part of the L will be 25 inches wide.  The short part of the L will be 36 inches tall and 25 inches wide.  The second wall will be a rectangle 180 inches at the base and 48 inches tall.  The third ballistic wall will be of an inverted T shape 90 inches wide along the base.  The left side of the T will be 34 inches tall and 35 inches wide.  The right side of the T will be 34 inches tall and 25 inches wide.  The center of the T will be 64 inches tall and 30 inches wide.  The fourth wall will be a rectangle 50 inches at the base and 64 inches tall.  No ricochet producing materials may be exposed to the front of the free-standing protective walls.
The award will be approximately $45,000 with an anticipated delivery date of 90 days after contract award.  This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  It should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation.  Any information provided to the Government in response to this RFI will become USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.  Written response is requested within 15 days after publication of this notice.

<DESC>The government is seeking sources to for the procurement and installation of an automated pneumatic target system to be installed on Range 1, Quantico VA.  The new target system will be computer operated using hand-held controllers. 
The contractor will be required to fabricate and install a total of 30 computer controlled, programmable personnel targets to provide 15 firing lanes of two targets each.  Each pair of targets must be 28 inches on center using a standard military E silhouette 20 inches by 40 inches, thus leaving 8 inches between the targets.  The pairs of targets must be separated by 20 inches, edge to edge to clearly separate each firing lane.  Targets will principally be operated in pairs, but must be capable of being faced and edged individually, in groups or simultaneously.  Targets must rotate from edge to face and back in  second intervals.  The target system must be installed with minimal earth disturbance.  Ditch-witch ditching is expected in order to bury electrical and pneumatic feed lines from the compressor to the targets.  Target mechanisms will be protected by installation of a protective wall consisting of shock absorbing concrete (SACON) blocks sufficient to defeat small arms rounds up to 7.62mm.  No ricochet producing hardware may extend above the protective wall. 
The control system must include a removable Toughbook type laptop computer (Mil Std 810F compliant) for automatic operation and allow targets to be controlled remotely using handheld devices.  There is no permanent range house at Range 1 so all control equipment must be removed from the range after each use to prevent pilferage.  The computer must be fully installed with programmable Windows-type software to operate the targetry.  The pneumatic operating system must include an air compressor with dryer package to include: a pressure gauge, regulator, filter, an air-cooled after-cooler, and a desiccant dryer assembly.   A small shelter is required to protect the compressor from the inclement weather.  The compressor will be located behind the firing line, approximately 100 yards from the targets.  Ricochet producing target mechanisms must be below the protective barrier in all cases.  The range has adequate impact barriers behind the targets.   Electric power is currently installed near the site.  Government electricians will stub power to the compressor site.
Delivery date is an anticipated 90 days after contract award.  This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  It should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation.  Any information provided to the Government in response to this RFI will become USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.

Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to assemble subretinal neurostimulators  are invited to submit complete and current information showing their capabilities within 5 calendar days from the day this notice is published.  Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information to allow the VA to evaluate the proposal relative to the above requirements.  This is not a solicitation; this is a request for information only.Inquires /information received after the established deadline shall not be considered.  The submission of this data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.  JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.  Identification of (1) the agency and (2) the contracting activity:	(1) VA Medical Center, Boston, MA	(2) Acquisition and Material Management Service	    940 Belmont Street	    Brockton, MA  023012. Nature and/or description of the action being approved:The Boston VA Center for Innovative Visual Rehabilitation wishes to purchase retinal implant electronic assembly services from Valtronic Technologies.3. Description of the supplies/services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):The purpose of the retinal implant assembly services is to aid the CIVR in developing chronically implantable subretinal neurostimulators.  This involves custom SMT assembly (including gold stud bump flip chip die attach operations) and highly specialized gold-tin soldering operations for critical prosthesis components at size scales below 500 microns.  The estimated value for the assembly of 160 such neurostimulators is $50,000.4. Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:FAR Part 6.302-1, Only one responsible source. (See #5 for clarification.)*5. Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:The proposed contractor has a highly skilled cadre of engineers that have been trained to develop specialized microelectronic assembly techniques which are specifically geared toward the creation of miniaturized neurostimulators for visual prosthesis research.  Valtronic has the most experience of any commercial vendor in existence with building miniaturized neural stimulators and they provide circuit assembly for a major vendor in the field, Advanced Bionics.  The development of  retinal prosthesis that is the core mission of the CIVR is contingent upon microassembly of the components in a timely manner with great accuracy.  *6. Describe the efforts that have been made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a Commerce Business Daily notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 (copy attached) and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:The following vendors were contacted on May 8, 2008, and they were either unable to provide services meeting the standard of performance or they were unable to do so at any comparable price point:1.	I2A Technologies, Inc., Fremont, CA, 2.	HEI, Inc., Victoria, MN, 3.	Engent, Inc., Norcross, GA 7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  This determination will be made at time of award.8. Description of the market survey that was conducted (i.e. names of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted:See the survey results under #6 above.  The CIVR (through the VA) has purchased micro-assembly services from the proposed contractor in the past at very favorable price points compared to similar vendors.9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as - an explanation as to why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statement of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for competition have not been developed or are not available.The VA CIVR has carefully developed high technology assembly capabilities through the proposed contractor.  These capabilities are not available elsewhere without substantial process development cost in time and dollars.   10. A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed an interest in theacquisition:  To date, no additional sources have expressed an interest.11. A statement of the actions, if any, that the department/service may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies/services is required in the future:If other vendors enter the field, or if existing vendors develop the necessary capabilities to meet the CIVRs needs at a competitive cost, consideration will be given these vendors in the future.

This 18 Jan 2008 Amendment changes the anticipated RFP release date from "to be determined" to 18 Jan 2008.  The PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE was first posted on 20 DECEMBER 2007, and titled DEVELOPMENT OF VARIABLE SPEED, VARIABLE DRAG REFUELING DROGUE (VSD/VDD).  The 14 January 2008 Amendment added the following information to the VSD/VDD Demonstration: For the purposes of the VSD/VDD Demonstration, a Safety of Flight Certificate is defined as a signed statement from the company based on the data presented in the safety of flight package and when operated to the defined limitations their drogue is safe for flight.
VSD/VDD DEMONSTRATION
Potential offerors have the option of participating in a demonstration of their existing Variable Speed Drogue/Variable Drag Drogue (VSD/VDD) candidate.  A potential offerors participation is strictly voluntary and a decision not to participate will not adversely affect the governments future evaluation of any proposal. The demonstration will be used by the government to assist in risk assessment. A potential offeror that decides not to participate in the flight demonstration may still participate in the resulting acquisition. All flight demonstrations will be performed on a legacy MC-130E/P tanker with Sargent Fletcher Incorporated (SFI) 48-000- 2/4 refueling pods. Potential offerors who are contemplating participation in the flight demonstration are asked to provide information as presented below.  This information is necessary to make necessary arrangements at the Government flight test facility.  Flight demonstration is expected to take place during the week of 25 February 2008.  However, this is a tentative date and is subject to change.
A team from the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) 413 Flight Test Squadron (FLTS) stationed at Hurlburt Field, Florida, will conduct the flight testing.  The 413 FLTS will conduct the flight testing at the Eglin Air Force Base/Hurlburt Field local area testing range.
The offeror does not need to be present at the flight demo to have their candidate drogue flown.  The offeror can elect to send the drogue and the appropriate technical data to the locations provided.  If the offeror elects to attend the flight demo, he/she will be provided a post-flight test briefing of the results.  Following the fight test, a video and brief summary of the flight test results will be provided to the offeror.  If the offeror is not present, the video and brief report will be mailed to the offeror along with return of the hardware provided for the demo. The offeror will only be permitted to view the demonstration of their specific drogue and any video recording will include only their drogue demonstration and no other.
The drogue will be flown in accordance with the offerors safety restrictions and envelope which has been validated by wind tunnel testing to be within the drag limits of the Sargent Fletcher pod.  A safety of flight package consisting of, as a minimum, airspeed versus drag data, flight limitations, verification of structural integrity and physical interfaces shall be provided to the government.  The offerors will be responsible for providing the necessary modification hardware to the existing Sargent Fletcher pod with associated technical data.  The offeror will provide any required checklists and a complete listing of the configuration of the flight evaluation drogue and pod modifications.  The government reserves the right to limit pod modifications based on complexity of the modification.  No modifications shall be allowed that will not allow the government to return the pod to the pre-modified condition.
2.0  Offeror Requirements for Flight Testing

<DESC><p>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE NOTICE: Please read this entire notice carefully as it constitutes the only notice that will be issued regarding the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intent to contract by other than full and open competition in the special research study for the Effect of Particle Shape on the Aerosol Retrieval from ABI. NOAA intends to award a sole source contract to Texas A&amp;M University - Corpus Christi, TX. The anticipated contract will be a firm-fixed price level of effort contract and will include a base year plus one (1) one-year option period. The applicable North American Industry Classification code is 541712, size standard is 500 employees. <br />The work to be performed is to provide science support to the GOES-R AWG aerosol team in modeling the optical and radiative properties of nonspherical aerosol particles. The contract will utilize the services of Texas A&amp; M University - Corpus Christi. The Texas A&amp; M Research Foundation provides unique experience that is unavailable within NESDIS. Only they can provide the computations that we need. The foundation has a long collaboration with NOAA and its institutes. They have a team of scientist from NOAA, NASA and academia working on the cloud algorithms from GOES-R. They also have an expert in the area of light scattering by nonspherical particles (ice crystals, in particular). Over years, they have developed various state of the art light scattering computational models. The optical properties of ice crystals which their team has simulated have been of great utility to the atmospheric radiative transfer community. These simulations of the optical properties of ice crystals that have been used in the NASA MODIS operational ice cloud retrieval. Therefore the Texas A&amp;M University plays a critical role in our project which relies heavily on their expertise. Because of the Texas A&amp;M University's extensive experience in light scattering computation, radiative transfer simulation, and remote sensing, they are the only contractor appropriate for this project. <br />Additionally, it is not the Government's intention to enter into a contract based on this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). This is a notice of intent to sole source only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the NOAA. NOAA will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to the subject of this request for capabilities statements. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred in responding to this notice.</p>

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service Fish Biology & Stock Assessment Division located in Honolulu, HI on a sole source basis with Steve Martell, The University of British Columbia Fisheries Centre.  The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed vendor will integrate data from the ongoing tagging program into the existing model, thus greatly improving the estimates of growth, size-selectivity and catchability coefficients in areas where the tagging information exists. In addition, recent relative abundance data from the NWHI annual lobster research survey will also be incorporated into the model. Model testing will be conducted to determine the limitations of the model. The research results will be documented and presented to an expert panel for review and comment. This is a collaborative project between scientists from NOAA Fisheries, Pacific Island Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC), Steve Martell, and The University of British Columbia Fisheries Centre.  The goal of this project is to satisfy the OMB Guidelines which require the modified model be reviewed yet again, and the findings posted. This research will facilitate that goal. The contractor, Steve Martell, has developed an integrated age-structured assessment model that simulates the meta-population structure of lobsters in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). The estimates of growth, size-selectivity and catchability coefficients would be greatly improved if data from the ongoing NWHI lobster tagging program were incorporated into the model. This project will integrate available tagging data into the assessment model, as well as recent relative abundance data from the NWHI annual lobster research survey. The model results will be documented and presented to an expert panel for review and comment. The government intends to negotiate a firm- fixed price contract with a period of performance that will start from date of award and ends May 15, 2009 plus two option years.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to issue a delivery order against a GSA contract number GS-25F-0062L to Xerox Corporation, 1301 K Street NW, Ste 300W, Washington, DC 20005 on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The proposed procurement is a renewal (2nd year) to an existing contract that will expire 31 Aug 2008 in which the Government is committed to a 5-year lease agreement renewable yearly.  The Xerox DocuColor DC8000 print center is not meant for day-to-day administrative or office use, but rather required training equipment for the U.S. Marine Corps Lithography course being taught at Defense Information School (DINFOS).  Students are required to learn to operate and maintain this particular printing system, and DINFOS Basic Lithography courses lesson plan is built based upon it.  The DC8000 is the main component of a standardized and fielded USMC print production system (TIPS).  This system is in use throughout the Corps in deployed areas, and the fixed station print facilities have begun to modernize to this same product.  Leasing equipment, rather than purchasing, allows DINFOS to more quickly react to changes in the field.  Life cycle for these presses would have to be pushed out to approximately 8 years with a purchase (cost factors), whereas, with a lease, they can be cycled for new products at the 5-year point with little or no additional budget impact.

This announcement constitutes the only notice, a written solicitation will not be issued.  
Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all proposals received by the closing date specified in the Request for Proposal (RFP).     A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>USAID/Madagascar intends to modify Contract No. 687-C-00-04-00155-00 with International Resources Group  (IRG) under the Sustainable Environmental and Forest Ecosystems Management (Jariala) Program.  The modification will extend the current contract by ten months with an additional cost of $2,300,000.  The contract will enable IRG to support the Madagascar Ministry of Environment, Water and Forests and Tourism (MEEFT) to fully consolidate and internalize the numerous strategic, organizational and policy reforms that the MEEFT has adopted with USAID assistance over the past four years. The extension will place a major focus on accompanying the MEEFT in communicating reforms to its regional offices and to other stakeholders and, notably, in building the capacity of regional offices to absorb and implement those reforms at the decentralized level. It is also a key period to reinforce the benefits of reform for other stakeholders in forest and environmental management and governance.

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under 706.302-70(b)(5) for the continued provision of specialized services when award to another resources would result in acceptable delays in the US Government commitment to the Government of Madagascar under the Strategic Objective agreement. However, the Government will consider all proposals received within 15 calendar days (fifteen days) after the date of publication of this synopsis. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct competitive procurement.

<DESC>US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), on behalf of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), has a requirement to purchase a Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer System. USAMRAA intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Thermo Electron. The intent is to make a sole source award pursuant to FAR 6.302(a)(1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Thermo is uniquely qualified to provide a quality triple quadrupole mass spectrometry system.  Several sources are capable of fulfilling the performance specifications required by the government, or manufacture a system that will meet the governments space requirements, but not both.  The government also requires that the mass spectrometry system utilize Xcalibur control software for instrument operation and data collection since the Division of Experimental Therapeutics currently has three mass spectrometers manufactured by Thermo Electron Corporation.  All of the instruments utilize Xcalibur software (offered only from Thermo Electron) to control the instruments and manipulate the spectra acquired during analysis.  Therefore, it is essential that the equipment to be purchased is capable of running the Xcalibur control software in order to minimize the time for scientists and technicians to become proficient in using the new equipment.  A mass spectrometer acquired from another manufacturer would delay using the new instrument since the staff would be unfamiliar with its operation and require extensive training to obtain the same level of proficiency.  This delay could jeopardize achieving milestones and research objectives for Malaria Drug Program Q.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document exists. Any firm that believes it can provide the stated required product within the established timeframe is invited to submit written notification to the Contracting Officer by way of the Contract Specialist within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of publication of this notice. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firms ability to provide the stated product within the established timeframe. Information can be sent to the Contract Specialist, Jennifer Jackson, at jennifer.jackson1@us.army.mil. No telephone requests will be accepted. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source contract.<BR><BR>

A) Locally produced asphalt would meet our needs.


*Is there an anticipated completion date for the associated earthwork and subgrade preparation?
B) The anticipated completion date for the preparation would have been August 1st.  However, there is a delay to this preparation and this may delay the start of the pavement by up to several months.



*What is the design thickness of the proposed asphalt layer?
C) The planned thickness will be 3" so as to allow our aircraft tow tractors to drive on.



*Does the proposed design include a thickened edge?  If so, what is the cross section - dimensions?
D) There should be no need for a thickened edge



*What is the required tonnage of asphalt needed on a per hour basis?
E) Standard industry practice.



*Will the government provide assistance [security clearance] in accessing the Base for the delivery trucks?
F) The materials truck will need to check in at the gate to enter the base.  The Air Force will provide them with the authorizations to enter the base but they will still need to go through the security check at the gate.  This will include a driver's license, registration, and proof of insurance.  This should not be an area that involves CBP.  The CE will contract with the local company and provide the directions for the company.






*Does the Government have a specific haul route within the Air Force Base?
G) Same situation as paragraph F.  The Air Force will give them directions for getting to our ramp.



*Are there any special flight line requirements pertaining to signage, flagging, or strobe lights on delivery trucks?
H) There will be no specific signage requirements for the trucks.  The Air Branch will need to move our aircraft prior to beginning the construction.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE JOB CORPS PROGRAM

Hartford Job Corps Academy, operated by Education Management Corporation, is located in Hartford Connecticut, is a federally funded educational and job training facility. There are a total of 200 students between the ages of 16 and 24, inclusive of 150 residential and  50 non-resident students, most of whom come from the local community, the northern and southern portion of Connecticut and bordering states.   

Enrollees in the program are screened by the Academy and Federal recruitment agencies. Common criterion for eligibility is the need and desire to learn a skill to become more employable. Enrollees are generally considered healthy, but physical and emotional problems can be present which must be consider and addressed. Some of the 200 authorized students may at any time be enrolled under the auspices of special disability programs, which accommodate students with a variety of physical impairments without age restrictions.

The program meets the needs of each individual and focuses on four (4) specific areas that enable the student to become successfully employed.  Although many other needs are also being met, the program focuses on building vocational skills, developing academic skills and increasing awareness of career success standard and core values.

Besides educational and vocational opportunities, students receive free housing, meals, medical and dental care, as well as living and clothing allowances.  There are daily recreational activities and outings scheduled weekly for all students who wish to participate.  Counseling services are available to assist students with their individual needs. Also when training is completed, Career Transition services are provided to assist with job placment and pursing independent living

Champion Creek drainage downstream of the area were straw mulch was applied (see map) shall be surveyed and treated for Idaho State listed noxious weeds and koshia.     

Additionally, a global positioning unit will be used (provided by USFS  see Section C, Government-furnished Property, if contractor does not have the ability to provide gps unit) to record areas of treatment by species. New infestations encountered will be GPSd and then treated according to the below specifications.

The contractor will provide transportation, supervision, labor, operating supplies, appropriate herbicide as specified below, dye (if desired for use), surfactant, and incidentals except those items listed in Section C, Government Furnished Property. NAICS Code: 115112. Size Standard: $6.5 million. Estimated start date: 7/30/08 with estimated completion date 9/30/08. This is 100% small business set aside.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) for a project to conduct methodologic work to estimate the characteristics that need to be accounted for in collecting CT numbers for muscle and adipose tissue in multiple centers with different scanners or alternatively how this information should best be collected in longitudinal studies where the likelihood that the CT scanner may change either in software or hardware.  USFC, in collaboration with the NIA, will establish and test, in a systematic way, methods that will be incorporated into an article for publication.   These methods will include:  1) Establishment of protocol and preparation of all the appropriate forms.  A general outline of this protocol follows but this may be altered substantially.  We have identified a male torso phantom that has a fat-like substance that can be added or subtracted.  Using this and several other phantoms, we will set up a protocol that addresses the limitations of current protocols.  We will then recruit 20 subjects from the three subgroups of body mass index, <25, 25-<30, and 30+.  These subjects would be scanned two times on the same scanner for intra-individual characteristics related to muscle attenuation and one time on a different manufacturers machine to test inter-individual characteristics; 2) procurement of the appropriate phantoms for these calibration experiments; 3) obtaining appropriate IRB consents from both University of San Francisco and the Intramural Research Program of the NIA; 4) Recruit appropriate subjects for the protocols and carry out imaging.  Subjects to be recruited should cover all BMI groups (<25, 25-<30, and 30-35);  5) analyze images and  6) prepare a manuscript for publication summarizing the results of this experiment and outline any further work that needs to be performed.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1(b) (1).
The cited authority is applicable because UCSF is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.  UCSF is an internationally known authority on the use of computerized tomography in the study of bone.  In several studies, UCSF has extended this research to the study of muscle and adipose tissue.  They have extensive experience in identifying and attempting to address these issues especially in population studies.  The expertise they will bring to this project is not available in other centers and researchers and for this project it is necessary to take advantage of this expertise.  The period of performance is 12 months.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of Far, Part 6, Competition Requirement.  Award will be made on an all or more basis to the lowest priced, technically acceptable source.

<DESC> Art Conservation Services

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Part 12 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-26.  The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 711510 with a small business size standard of $6,500,000 annual gross receipts for a period of three years. 

BACKGROUND:  The Fine Arts Program provides national leadership and expertise in fine art care and policy for GSAs Fine Arts Collection.  The program seeks to manage the Fine Arts Collection at the highest ethical and stewardship standards; to ensure the preservation, legal compliance, accessibility, and understanding of the Fine Arts Collection; and to contribute to creating high quality federal buildings for federal employees and the public they serve.

The Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (31 U.S.C. 3512), as implemented by OMB Circ. No. A - 123, establishes procedures for internal financial and managerial accountability and control.  Section 2 (ii) states, "funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation."  Internal Controls and Risk Assessments require that GSAs Fine Arts Collection is properly maintained, accounted for, and accessible to the American people.  The Director for Design Excellence and the Arts is responsible for this role for the agency with Component Managers for the Art in Architecture Program and the Fine Arts Program. 

General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Contracting and Facilities Division (PGE),is requesting services to provide art conservation services as follows:

The contractor shall furnish the necessary materials, labor, supplies and management to provide art conservation services.  This work shall include (but not limited to): 

Provide maintenance for the following three artworks, located on exterior public plazas at the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building and Courthouse, 255 East Temple Street,  Los Angeles, California. 

The following art works require maintenance/treatment:

	TITLE: 	Molecule Man
	ARTIST:	Jonathan Borofsky
	MATERIAL:	1 " aluminum plate
	SIZE:	32' x 2510 x 2510
	DATE: 	1991
	ITEM #:	AA236

	TITLE: 	The New World
	ARTIST:	Tom Otterness
	MATERIAL:	bronze, concrete
	SIZE:	site installation  4 x 150 frieze, two bronze sculptural elements
	DATE: 	1991
	ITEM #:	AA131

TITLE: 	untitled
	ARTIST:	Joel Shapiro
	MATERIAL:	cast bronze
	SIZE:	11 tall
	DATE: 	1991
	ITEM #:	AA154

Required services will include, but will not be limited to, the following:

Provide a plan of work, estimated time and staff required and estimated cost based on treatments as outlined herein.

The contractor will be responsible for providing the necessary professional services to ensure that the proposed treatment will not have an adverse impact upon the aesthetic, historic, and physical integrity of the artworks.  It may be required that treatments be reversible in order to ensure that removal of materials and techniques will not endanger the physical welfare of the artwork.  The known character of the artwork should not be modified.  As much as possible, decayed parts of an artwork will be conserved, not replaced.  The treatment conducted shall be the safest and least intrusive restorative method so as not to compromise the original integrity of the artwork, and should follow the guidelines for the American Institute for the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC) Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice. 

The contractor may contact the artists or artist representatives as needed regarding appropriateness of maintenance, finishes, etc. so that any work will match original fabrication as much as possible.

Prices established will include all costs associated with the inspection, maintenance, and preparation of the report for the artworks, including all travel.

The contractor will verify all dimensions, familiarize self with existing conditions (including dates and times that work may be performed), and obtain full knowledge of ANY AND ALL difficulties that may be encountered during the execution of this work.
This is a FIRM FIXED PRICE Contract.

The following maintenance schedule and recommendations by the artists is for information purposes only and should not be perceived as options for this effort.  The intent is to provide a guide for the maintenance envisioned by the artist.  

Proposed Treatments are -

Task 1:  Maintenance instructions from the artist Jonathan Borofsky for Molecule Man: 
Routine maintenance of sculpture should not include the use of any abrasives, abrasive pads, or abrasive cleaners. Also, no solvents should be used.  In discussions with Coricone Corp., the finish can be expected to last from three to six years before a new application is needed.  New applications involve removal of old finish and application of new. There are two main influences affecting the longevity of the coating: air or industrial pollution, and dirt. The best performance for the coricone finish will be obtained by a cleaning every three months with a mild soap and water solution (such as Joy dish soap) and a thorough rinsing. It is important that this soap solution is neutral, not acidic or alkaline. It is Jonathan Borofsky's wish that Ronald McPherson at LaPaloma either perform needed repairs or act in a consulting capacity at such a time that a new coating is needed or in the event that there is damage to the sculpture, i.e. graffiti, to be repaired. The piece is not anodized, but Coricone 1700 behaves and can be maintained similarly to anodize aluminum.  Also, it makes ready another reference (Technical Trade Association) for maintenance of aluminum.

Fabricator:	Ronald J. McPherson		Phone:    818-890-2216

Maintenance:	

The sculpture is made from 1 1/2" thick welded aluminum plate (6061-T6). It has a ground finish with a 9" disc, 50 grit silicon oxides. The piece was degreased with solvents, steamed cleaned, then spray coated with two coats of Coricone 1700 Metal Sealer.

See Attachment 4 for product brochure with technical performance data from Coricone Corporation about Coricone 1700 and a publication from Technical Information Center that deals with the maintenance of anodized aluminum.  See Attachment 1 for pictures of the sculptures.

The piece is not anodized, but Coricone 1700 behaves and can be maintained similarly to that of anodized aluminum. Also, it makes ready another reference (Technical Trade Association) for maintenance of aluminum. WITH THESE EXCEPTIONS:

Routine maintenance of sculpture should NOT include the use of any abrasives, abrasive pads or abrasive cleaners. Also, NO solvents should be used. In discussions with Coricone Corp., the finish can be expected to last from three (3) to six (6) years before a new application is needed. New applications involve removal of old finish and application of new in procedures as described above.

There are two main influences affecting the longevity of the coating. One (1) is air or industrial pollution, two (2) is dirt. The best performance for the corticone finish will be obtained by a cleaning every three months. This should be done with a mild soap and water solution (such as Joy dish soap) and a thorough rinsing. It is important that this soap solution is neutral, NOT acidic or alkaline.

It is Jonathan Borofsky's wish that Ronald McPherson at La Paloma either perform needed repairs or act in a consulting capacity at such a time that a new coating is needed or in the event that there is damage to the sculpture, i.e. graffiti, to be repaired.

MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES FOR "THE NEW WORLD": 

CEMENT FRIEZE: 
Power water wash every year.  Use a light detergent. 
	
BRONZE ELEMENTS: 
	
PATINA: Patination is the name for the process of coloring metals.  These colors arise from chemical interactions between elements in the metal and various chemicals.  A patina on bronze is the equivalent of rust on iron only bronze is much more interesting than iron because the copper in the bronze reacts with different chemicals to produce different colors.  The important thing to note is that the patina is not paint but a very thin conversion coat on the surface of the bronze.  Accordingly, as different chemicals are brought in contact with the surface of the metal, the color is liable to change.  

The purpose of waxing and cleaning the bronze is to: 1) protect the surface from such interactions with pollutants and 2) to clean off any materials such as bird droppings, dust, tree resin, etc. which may come to rest on the surface of the bronze. 
	
PROHIBTIONS: 1. Never use any chemicals, cleaning solutions, tarnish removers, or any other unknown or previously unused substance to clean the surface of the sculpture.  2.  Never use any abrasive cleaning pads, steel wool, or sandpaper on the bronze.  Use of such materials could mar the surface of the sculpture and require refinishing of the entire piece. 

PROCEDURE: 1. Wash the sculpture with warm water and soft cloth.  A soft brush may help get into corners.  2. Accretions that are difficult to remove may be softened with a lacquer thinner.  If a buildup remains, it can be removed by scraping with a soft plastic spatula.  This should rarely, if ever, be necessary.  3. Apply a good commercial paste wax such as Butchers to the surface with a soft bristle brush.  Use a circular motion and try to rub the wax into the surface of the metal in a thin, uniform coat. If too thick a coat is put on, the wax may turn white or show brush strokes.  One way to prevent a buildup of wax is to wipe off the brush onto a paper towel before putting the brush to the surface of the bronze.  After the wax has dried, (usually about 20 minutes) buff the surface to a good gloss first with a long bristle, "shoe shine" brush and, thereafter, with soft, clean cloths.  Try to remember you are polishing the wax and not trying to rub through the wax or the patina.  If a higher gloss is required or desired, a harder wax may be used.  This requires more skill and care as only a small (12"x12") area should be done at a time.  All brush streaks should be obliterated with brushes, rags, and the palm of your hand before the wax has dried. Less buffing after drying will provide for less gloss, yet offer the added strength and durability of a hard wax formulation. 
	
PERIODICITY: Initially, treatment should be done two times per year: early spring and late fall. Temperature should be in the range of 55 to 75 degrees F. During the summer months, waxing should be done on a cloudy (but dry) day or early in the morning.  Appearance of the surface of the sculpture will dictate whether spacing between cleaning can be lengthened or shortened. 

See Attachment 2 for pictures of the sculptures.
		
Task 3: Maintenance instructions for Joel Shapiro bronze works, from Pace Wildenstein 
             Gallery (Untitled)

General Care and Maintenance of Bronze

The sculpture should be kept clean.  Accumulated dirt should be washed off.  Cleaning and Washing should be performed on an as needed basis.  Washing should start with filtered tap water, a common in-line hose filter used for filling RV water supply tanks to remove odor and particles works very well for this purpose.  A soft bristle brush may be carefully used on the textured eraser surface only as needed to loosen the accretions.  Excess water may be blotted from the surface, if desired.

The sculpture should not be in the direct line of any lawn watering sprinkler system.  A sculpture conservator to determine if the wax finish needs to be re-applied should check the work annually*.  Generally, it is healthy for the work to be waxed every 2-3 years.  However, if the work is installed in direct full sunlight or near the ocean once a year is recommended.

Any maintenance or conservation beyond the procedures outlined above should be referred to a qualified professional conservator.

The protective wax is a Butcher Wax or any hard paste is typically used. 

See Attachment 3 for pictures of the sculptures.

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) are established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011. 

Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 6 Aug 2008, 4:15 p.m., EST.     All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.     Anticipated award date is on or about July 28, 2008. Contact Steve Metcalfe at Steven.H.Metcalfe@uscg.mil or 252-335-6714 for questions regarding this solicitation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 01 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR INFRAREDCAMERA SYSTEM.	Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This noticeserves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will notbe issued.The purpose of this amendment is to provide the technical questions received below withthe answers that were provided.QUESTIONS:1. Provide the camera image measurement range from -50F to 1200F with at least 1Fresolution (supply Neutral Density filter if required) Am I correct in my interpretationof the specification that a single range encompassing these extreme temperatures isdesired as opposed to a recomposed sequence made from smaller sub ranges? 3. Provide the camera image measurement range from 50F to 2400F with at least 2Fresolution (supply Neutral Density filter if required)	Same exact concerns as above.4. Ability for the camera to measure cold temperatures from ambient (70F) to liquidnitrogen   (-320F)5. Do the calibration specifications included apply for each of the four lenses?6. Ability to accept 2-4 lens, 20-22 lens, 40-45, 60-65 lens.  The literalinterpretation is that the camera needs to be able to work with these lenses, but thewording does not state that the lenses need to be quoted.  Can you clarify this please,because if the wording stays the same, we will not quote any lenses.ANSWERS:The requirement of a temperature range span of -50F to 1200F with 1F resolution may bemeet with recomposed sequence made from smaller sub ranges.The sensitivity to low temperatures will decrease with the neutral density filterrequired to obtain the higher temperatures, please provide the temperature range with theneutral density filter for the camera submitted for consideration for this requirement.The requirement of a temperature range span of 50F to 2400F with 2F resolution may bemeet with recomposed sequence made from smaller sub ranges.The sensitivity to low temperatures will decrease with the neutral density filterrequired to obtain the higher temperatures, please provide the temperature range with theneutral density filter for the camera submitted for consideration for this requirement.The requirement "Ability for the camera to measure cold temperatures from ambient (70F)to liquid nitrogen   (-320F)" may not be possible from any 3-5um camera we know, butwanted to place the desired camera requirements out on the open market to see what isavailable.If the camera is required to be calibrated by the factory for support the camerasoftware, then each lens should be provided with calibration but if the end user canperform the calibration,  then the additional lens may be provided without factorycalibration.The quote should include the lens which is included with the standard camera package. The other lens should be listed as options to purchase.The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASAAcquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on July 21, 2008 to Judith Drabkin atJudith.R.Drabkin@nasa.gov; FAX: 256-544-4401.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<DESC>Questions and Answers for RFI0008  MPRS PODS RFI
As of 17 July 2008
1.   16 June 2008
Question:   There are two different response dates noted (30 June and 9 July).  The upper right of the page states the 9 July date.  Can you please tell me which is the correct date, or clarify if different submittal types are expected on each date?
	Answer:   The due date for all material is 9 July 2008.
2.   25 June 2008
Question:   Is it the Governments intent that only the MPRS pods be replaced (utilizing the existing MPRS pylons with the new Pods)?    
	Answer:   Our intent is to provide our war fighters with the most cost effective system possible; while this may require a new pylon to satisfy the pod to aircraft interface, the new pods/pylons should not require any structural modifications to the aircraft for installation.
3.  26 June 2008
Question:   The RFI states the need of MPRS Pods on 20 KC-135R aircraft.
a.	 Should I assume 2 Pods/aircraft?
b.	The RFI does not ask for spares, so should I assume 10%?  Or does the program require a number of spares?
	Answer:   
a.	Yes, there are 2 pods per aircraft.
b.	The program office is considering requiring 6 spare pods for a total of 46; however, the RFI requests proof of logistics support  parts supply, spares, repair, support equipment and tech data, where we are looking for suppliers recommendations on the number of required spare parts and pods.
4.  26 June 2008
Question:   Could not find a time span/need date/schedule  for the MPRS.  Could you provide critical USAF needs dates such as 1st unit delivery date and time span, developmental/operation/cert test start, quantity needed per year?
Answer:   There is no defined schedule.  The RFI requests that responses address anticipated delivery schedule and product availability in order to help us determine a realistic fielding schedule.
5.  26 June 2008
Question:   Flight Certification: does the program require FAA certification (as KC-X requires) or military certification instead?  
	Answer:   Military certification.
6.  26 June 2008
Question:   Would a KC-135R be made available (at not charge, or if chargeable, at what rate) to perform DT/OT and certification flight testing of pylon/aircraft/pod system.  
Answer:   The program office is interested in identifying Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or Non-Developmental Item (NDI) equipment that can be adapted for use on the KC-135, therefore developmental testing should be minimal; but at this time we are only looking for suppliers to provide estimates of how much testing would be required.  The costs associated with the aircraft to be used for testing does not need to be considered in these estimates.
7.  16 July 2008
Question:  May we come for a visit to discuss the RFI in more detail?
Answer:  Since this is strictly a request for information, all questions must be posed through a written format.  So visits are not available at this time.  However, an industry day may be scheduled in the future and face to face discussions will be allowed on that day.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the interim infrastructure solution of the project. The acquisition of the specified Stonegate, Cisco, and IPS Proventia hardware products are necessary to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of this infrastructure.During the Joint Management Council (JMC) meeting held on July 25th, 2007, the IT JPMO was tasked to deploy an IT infrastructure at the Tier 1 consolidation posts to support IT as a shared service. To address this direction, the IT JPMO has developed an interim IT infrastructure solution using the industrys best practices.Technically the selected solution is very similar to the current connection that exists between the two networks domestically. That IT infrastructure was selected because it would enable the majority of the pre-determined official applications in use, and since the design is already active domestically a new complete risk analysis and adjudication would not be necessary, which would have added considerable time to the schedule. Security requirements for USAID and DoS were identified and used in this infrastructure design. Specific components within the infrastructure were chosen by the engineers based on USAID and Diplomatic Security requirements, the ability of the compatibility of the components within existing systems and overall performance. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the DoS and USAID security requirements as a key component of this infrastructure.<BR><BR>

Interested sources must respond with information to confirm evidence of their qualifications and capabilities. 
Evaluation Factors For Award:  Prospective offers are required to submit a technical and business proposal as discussed herein.  Proposals will be technically evaluated as either "acceptable" or "not acceptable" on the basis of the following criteria.  
a)	Contractor Qualificationsb)	Past Performancec)	Qualifications of Key Personneld)	Course content and outline
The Government will make award to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation terms and conditions, and represents the best value to the Government.  Any proposal determined to be "not acceptable' in any evaluated area, criteria, or sub-element thereof, will render the entire proposal to be unacceptable and therefore rejected from further consideration.  One-on-one discussions may be held, at the option of the Government, with one or more offerors, as determined necessary by the Contracting Officer, to clarify statements, resolve issues and omissions, etc.  The Government is seeking offers which provide the best combination of attributes and price in order to select the greatest value or "best buy" offer.  Therefore, award may be made to other than the lowest priced offer based on the evaluation criteria as previously provided through the SIR.
Proposal Content:  A prospective offeror must submit a complete technical and business proposal, which will encompass, but is not limited to, the content specified herein.  All technical and business proposal areas must be fully addressed.  A negative response is required in the event of no experience for a particular area, or for any item that is not applicable.  Any omission or partial and vague responses may lead to the rejection of the offeror's proposal without discussions with the offeror.  The Government reserves the right to use and evaluate any and all available information pertinent to any offeror and its subcontractors, in addition to the data incorporated in the submitted technical and business proposals, and which may be related to performance periods beyond the last three (3) years.
Tiered Evaluation Of Proposals:  A tiered evaluation of offers will be used in this source selection.  Offers from other than small business concerns will only be considered after the determination that an insufficient number of offers from responsible small business concerns were received.  Once offers are received the FAA will evaluate a single tier of offers according to the order of precedence specified in this SIR.  If no award can be made at the first tier, the evaluation will proceed to the next higher lettered tier until award can be made.  The tiered order of precedence for considering offers is (from first to last):
a)	Socially and economically disadvantaged business (SEDB) expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.b)	Service-disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB).c)	Very small business.d)	Small business.e)	Other-than small business.
Response submittals must include the following information:
a)   Name of companyb)   Addressc)   Phone and Fax numberd)   Point of contacte)   Email addressf)   Business size status (8(a), Small Business, SDVOSB, VSB, etc.)g)   Verification of registration in the Central Contractor's Registration (CCR)h)   Any other pertinent information
Any offeror who believes they can meet the FAA requirements and estimate within the established timeframes is requested to provide supporting qualifications, technical proposal, and cost proposal by July 22, 2008.  
The FAA prefers that all response submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following email at pat.workman@faa.gov Fax, (425) 227-1055.

Interested sources must respond with information to confirm evidence of their qualifications and capabilities. 
Evaluation Factors For Award:  Prospective offers are required to submit a technical and business proposal as discussed herein.  Proposals will be technically evaluated as either "acceptable" or "not acceptable" on the basis of the following criteria.  
a)	Contractor Qualificationsb)	Past Performancec)	Qualifications of Key Personneld)	Course content and outline
The Government will make award to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation terms and conditions, and represents the best value to the Government.  Any proposal determined to be "not acceptable' in any evaluated area, criteria, or sub-element thereof, will render the entire proposal to be unacceptable and therefore rejected from further consideration.  One-on-one discussions may be held, at the option of the Government, with one or more offerors, as determined necessary by the Contracting Officer, to clarify statements, resolve issues and omissions, etc.  The Government is seeking offers which provide the best combination of attributes and price in order to select the greatest value or "best buy" offer.  Therefore, award may be made to other than the lowest priced offer based on the evaluation criteria as previously provided through the SIR.
Proposal Content:  A prospective offeror must submit a complete technical and business proposal, which will encompass, but is not limited to, the content specified herein.  All technical and business proposal areas must be fully addressed.  A negative response is required in the event of no experience for a particular area, or for any item that is not applicable.  Any omission or partial and vague responses may lead to the rejection of the offeror's proposal without discussions with the offeror.  The Government reserves the right to use and evaluate any and all available information pertinent to any offeror and its subcontractors, in addition to the data incorporated in the submitted technical and business proposals, and which may be related to performance periods beyond the last three (3) years.
Tiered Evaluation Of Proposals:  A tiered evaluation of offers will be used in this source selection.  Offers from other than small business concerns will only be considered after the determination that an insufficient number of offers from responsible small business concerns were received.  Once offers are received the FAA will evaluate a single tier of offers according to the order of precedence specified in this SIR.  If no award can be made at the first tier, the evaluation will proceed to the next higher lettered tier until award can be made.  The tiered order of precedence for considering offers is (from first to last):
a)	Socially and economically disadvantaged business (SEDB) expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.b)	Service-disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB).c)	Very small business.d)	Small business.e)	Other-than small business.
Response submittals must include the following information:
a)   Name of companyb)   Addressc)   Phone and Fax numberd)   Point of contacte)   Email addressf)   Business size status (8(a), Small Business, SDVOSB, VSB, etc.)g)   Verification of registration in the Central Contractor's Registration (CCR)h)   Any other pertinent information
Any offeror who believes they can meet the FAA requirements and estimate within the established timeframes is requested to provide supporting qualifications, technical proposal, and cost proposal by July 22, 2008.  
The FAA prefers that all response submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following email at pat.workman@faa.gov Fax, (425) 227-1055.

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is soliciting proposals, from all Small Businesses, for the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Technical Reports Preparation Support Services. This notice is, in essence, a re-issuance of a notice for solicitation NIHES2008017, which was cancelled for as a result of a NAICS Code appeal. The previous notice was cancelled after a NAICS Code appeal. The previous solicitation was under NAICS Code 541712, Research and Development. This notice and solicitation are under NAICS Code 511130, Book Publishers. The Contractor shall serve as a resource to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for the preparation of Public Health Service documents describing NTP studies of the toxicology and carcinogenicity of selected chemicals. The documents to be produced are generically known as Technical Reports, which are government-produced, peer-reviewed, book-style documents describing in full detail studies conducted and overseen by the NTP. Two principal kinds of reports will be produced, differing primarily in length and the type of review process they undergo. The first are book-length monographs (approximately 150 to 300 pages) that provide an overview of the literature on the biologic effects of a particular substance or set of chemicals and full details of the conduct, results, and interpretation of long-term (generally 2-year) NTP studies of the effects of the test chemical in rodents. The subject matters in these reports include general toxicology, animal physiology, histologic and clinical pathology, chemistry, genetics, and statistics, and may also on occasion include pharmacology, molecular biology, immunotoxicity, developmental and reproductive toxicology, or other related disciplines. Historically these reports have primarily consisted of Technical Reports on long-term carcinogenesis studies, but future reports, similar in size and complexity, may deal with other specialties such as reproductive or developmental toxicology. The short reports also describe a variety of toxicity studies in rodents, generally shorter in duration. Historically these reports have been NTP Toxicity Reports on short-term toxicity studies in rodents, but future reports may also deal with other specialties such as immunotoxicity. These reports are generally shorter in length (50 to 150 pages) and involve the same subject areas as the long reports. The Contractor shall work in concert, with NTP staff scientists and NTP contractors to provide technical writing, copy editing, proofreading, word processing, desktop publishing, graphics, file research, and record keeping services. File research is broadly defined as reviewing laboratory reports and extracting relevant experimental information and also capturing, downloading and reformatting files of tabular data. The Contractor shall engage in report preparation activities, at the direction of the Project Officer, for approximately 40 reports in various stages at one time. Each report will be prepared in a series of five or four drafts, each incorporating text, materials, and revisions from NTP staff. Each report will be presented for outside peer review at one of the intermediate draft stages; some reviews of Technical Reports are conducted in public session. The Contractor shall provide review draft reports for each draft stage and shall also prepare desk top publishing files for use by the Government and PDF and/or HTML files for display on the NIEHS World Wide Web servers. Approximately 24 reports shall be presented for review and printed each year; the Contractor should expect to commence preparation of approximately two reports per month and to deliver approximately two drafts per week. The Contractor should be prepared to provide flexibility in scheduling deliverables, in consultation with the Project Officer, to accommodate Program needs, particularly to accommodate the presentation of several (as many as eight to ten) reports for review at one time. The contractor shall archive all materials received, maintain a log of all materials received and delivered, and submit a biweekly status report detailing the status of each report in preparation and the cumulative labor hours spent on each report. All materials sent to the Contractor are considered the property of the Government, and are not be used for any other purpose. Each report shall follow a standard format and will contain a cover page, various front matter, (e.g. Note to the Reader; Title Page; Tables of Contents, Figures, and Tables; lists of contributors; and in later drafts, lists of reviewers and summary of reviewers comments and an overall summary) separate sections for an Abstract, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, References, and various Appendixes. Page layout will include text, tables (both embedded in pages of text and multi-page data sets), line art graphics, and photomicrographs with captions. In various drafts, text may have different spacing and columniation. Pages will carry headers and/or footers identifying the report by name and number, draft status, and page number. At various draft stages the page numbering may be either numerically consecutive from the front or alphanumeric for individual appendixes. Contents and format requirements are subject to periodic revision by the Program and the Project Officer. Examples of currently produced reports are available for view under NTP Study Reports on the NTP website http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov. Reports are to be prepared with suitable software publishing package with the capability to incorporate the entire report, including all headings, text, tables, line art images, and photomicrographs, into a single file. The Contractor shall be able to produce hard copies, electronic files, and Portable Document (PDF) files of the entire report, or sections thereof, for use by the NTP. The contractor shall provide Section 508 Compliant web-optimized PDF files for those draft stages that will be placed on the NTP web site. The Contractor shall be able to receive and capture electronic files with text, graphics, and tables from a variety of sources, platforms, and programs. Electronic data accessing methods will include reading disks, e-mail attachments (originating both from Macintosh and PC platforms), and World Wide Web sites. These files may be in a variety of formats and programs, including but not limited to MS Word (various versions) for text files, Excel spreadsheets, and TIFF (Tagged Image File Format), GIF, or JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) files for photographs. The Contractor should also be able to read and capture text with citations incorporated in reference libraries (e.g., EndNote). The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring the accuracy of transcription of any electronically converted or hand-keyed text or data. On occasion the Contractor may be asked to prepare graphical displays of data (e.g., time plots or bar graphs) or chemical structures and metabolism pathways. These should be prepared as transportable files with programs such as Photoshop for line art, Freehand for graphics, and Chem Draw or ISIS/Draw for chemical structures and not be embedded in a proprietary format. The contractor shall have the capability of scanning line art graphics (e.g., chemistry spectra, schematic diagrams) into electronic files at a resolution of 600-1200 dpi. In the event that photographs (rather than digital files) of photomicrographs are provided, the contractor shall have the capability of scanning the photograph at the original quality and producing a TIFF file at a final resolution of 300 dpi for color images or with gray tones for black and white images. For all graphics the contractor shall use programs that capture the required information in a file format without loss of quality of the image. During the report preparation process the Contractor shall be able to extract portions of entire sections or the report and send them as electronic files to NTP staff for review. The Contractor will certify that a written enforced administrative process to identify, manage, reduce and eliminate conflicting financial interest is currently in effect. The anticipated effective date of the subsequent award is January 1, 2009. The performance period for the base contract is expected to be 60 months. Should the Government choose to exercise the time extension options for continued support; the period may be extended to December 31, 2019. For estimating purposes the Government anticipated an approximate level-of-effort of 12 person-years per year for the length of the contract and for each one-year extension option. The Government anticipates the participation of a principal investigator, a production supervisor, senior science writers, technical writers/copy editor, desktop publishing specialists and clerical staff. There is no prescribed mix of writers/editors and or desktop publishing specialist, but rather bidders should develop a strategy and team they feel is appropriate for performing the required task. The expected release date of the RFP is July 10, 2008 with proposals due August 11, 2008 (per FAR 5.203(e)). Interested organizations should request a copy of the RFP in writing from David C. Sedgley, Contract Specialist, P.O. Box 12874, 79 T.W. Alexander Drive, Building 4401, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709; by telephone (919) 541-4027 or by FAX request (301) 435-2709.

<DESC><p>This notice is being amended to correct the following sentence from the last paragraph,&nbsp;line nine, "The Contractor shall provide and support the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the IJPS Network Communications Element over the life of the contract." to "The Contractor shall provide and support the installation, operation, and maintenance of the IJPS Network Communications Element over the life of the contract." The word "design"&nbsp; has been deleted from the sentence.</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Systems (NESDIS) Office of Satellite Operations has a requirement to design, install, operate and maintain the IJPS Network Communications Element. <br />The Office of Satellite Operations (OSO) of the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) currently operates a joint Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) program in conjunction with the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). This joint system consists of two fully coordinated independent polar satellite systems that are referred to as the Initial Joint Polar System (IJPS). As part of their IJPS operations, OSO currently provides telecommunications, networking, and Network Operating Center (NOC) capabilities to support the mission. As part of a new contract for the existing services provided to support the mission, OSO is looking for information and innovative capabilities from industry that will enable it to continue its current mission and enhance the service offerings for telecommunications and NOC services.
<p>Communications Services: <br />The contractor shall be able to operate an IJPS Network that will provide commercial-grade data communications capabilities within the network using industry standard network components and protocols. The IJPS network will consist of a communications link between Suitland (Maryland) and Darmstadt (Germany) that can handle a data throughput rate of at least 45 Mbps. The IJPS Network will also provide a backup link from Darmstadt to Suitland to handle telemetry and command data flows between Wallops Island (Virginia) and Darmstadt (Germany). In addition, the IJPS Network will consist of out-of-band communication links to handle the network management capabilities of the NOC.</p>
<p>NOC Services: <br />The contractor shall provide managed security services to monitor on a 24/7/365 basis IJPS Network and OSO enterprise networking equipment, such as spanning servers, switches/routers, firewall, servers, and network intrusion detection in Suitland (Maryland) , Darmstadt (Germany), Wallops Island (Virginia), and Fairbanks (Alaska). The NOC shall provide rapid notification and reporting of both system operational availability and/or system security issues following detection of a component failure or security intrusion incident.</p>
<p>The overall security categorization for the IJPS Ground System is:<br />SC IJPS = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, High), (availability, High)}</p>
<p>Therefore, the contractor shall meet Federal Security Information Security Management Act (FISMA) 800-53-A controls for high security system at the NOC. The NOC service features shall also include, but are not limited to, Event Correlation across devices, Automated Inventory Audit and Reporting, Patch Management, and Vulnerability and Penetration Testing. The NOC services will be required to provide backup NOC operations at another location.</p>
<p>Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) Support Services: <br />The contractor shall provide O&amp;M services for the OSO enterprise networking infrastructure that supports IJPS operations. The infrastructure includes but is not limited to networking switching, routers, intrusion detection devices, firewalls, and telecommunications devices. The services will include, at a minimum, staging, configuration, updates, firewall rules changes and management. The contractor will also be responsible for preventative maintenance and equipment lifecycle management. The OSO enterprise networking infrastructure is operating in Suitland (Maryland), Darmstadt (Germany), Wallops Island (Virginia), and Fairbanks (Alaska).</p>
<p>In addition, the contractor shall provide O&amp;M service to software applications for NOAA servers in Darmstadt that receive and forward satellite data and products from Darmstadt to Suitland. Services to be provided include modification of a Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) software application product to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt the product to a modified environment.<br />The contract will be for a base year of twelve (12) months plus four (4) one-year option periods. The Contractor shall provide and support the installation, operation and maintenance of the IJPS Network Communications Element over the life of the contract. The NAICS Code is 517919. This requirement will be competed using full and open competition procedures pursuant to FAR Part 6.1.</p>

<DESC>This amendment to Solicitation #08ERSS0014 is issued to extend the response date from 7/17/2008 to 7/24/2008,  to answer questions provided by vendors and to provide a revised Statement of Work to include Model numbers and replacement of air filters schedule (changes in sow are indicated with two ** 's before and after item).
Question for Solicitation  08ERSS0014
1. During our site visit we noticed that many items that required preventive maintenance are not listed in the solicitation (i.e., motor control centers, critical valves, fire control valves, and expansion tanks). We assume there was a reason, however some of this equipment can effect the operation of other equipment listed. Are we correct to exclude any such equipment as part of our response to your solicitation?
Please include in your proposal.
2. During our site visit, we were verbally made aware that some listed equipment was currently not operative. Please advise these items, and/or if should be excluded as part of our response to your solicitation.
Equipment list is updated to include Model #'s
3. Why was there no provision in the solicitation for asbestos awareness?  Through this site visit we also notice asbestos present in all mechanical areas.  As part of our company's responsibilities all our mechanics working in areas must be informed of conditions and received asbestos awareness training and desired equipment prior servicing.  Additionally, who will remove asbestos if a repair needed in these areas?
Asbestos abatement was completed on the Gabrielson Building in 1991, this was before my time, and however, there are several boxes of records from this. It should be assumed there is none left, however proper PPE is suggested. If asbestos is discovered during repairs, it should be addressed at that time. 
4. Can you clarify all of section of solicitation for (b) Lighting: Interior and Parking?  This section reads to us that we will be responsible for all lighting for the interior and parking, plus the installation of some new lighting equipment. Also, is there (and will there continue to be) any inventory of light bulbs or replacement parts on hand?
This only would apply if this was new construction of Electrical/Lighting work.		5. What is the limit on how many $2,500 repairs will there be done annually?   Normally, there will be a limit of how many single repairs are done annually, so all the contractors can fairly bid the contract cost for these repairs.
There is no way to predict how many single repairs will be needed during a given time, if repairs are necessary, recommendations for the repairs will be given with a quote.
6. Is there a section in solicitation for Water Treatment?
It is required in the Statement of Work to provide testing of Compressor oil and Glycol and provide recommendations if there are discrepencies.  
7. Is the HVAC Water Systems 2 or 4 pipe systems?
Field Verification was expressed in the Statement of Work, however, there is a chilled water loop and a hot water loop.
8. Is there any major or minor deficiencies in the equipment that USGS is currently aware?
To date, all equipment was performing as expected.

<DESC>BACKGROUND:  When questions for the Pre-Proposal Conference began arriving, the Government Team reviewed each question and sorted it by who would be responsible for providing the response.  During this review, the team realized many of the questions were contractual in nature and dealt with Sections L & M. Mid to Late Tuesday afternoon, the team discovered that an earlier/incorrect version of Sections L & M had been issued.<BR><BR>The team reviewed our options and based on those discussions, the Contracting Officer made the decision that it was in the best interest of the Government and the offerors to cancel today's Pre-Proposal Conference.  <BR><BR>NOW WHAT:  The Team is currently revising Sections L & M and will re-issue them in their entirety via AM 01 NLT than Close of Business July 21, 2008. Responses to all remaining questions will be provided via a second amendment scheduled for issuance early - mid next week.  If it is determined a Pre-Proposal Conference is still needed, we will advise as soon as possible. The date for receipt of proposals remains unchanged at this time.

<SUBJECT>83--Modification to Previously Posted Presolicitation Notice, General Purpose Medium Shelter
<SOLNBR>M6785408R3025
<ARCHDATE>08312008
<CONTACT>Lisandra TorresE-mail Only
<DESC>A Presolicitation Notice was previously posted on 22 April 2008 in advance of Solicitation No. M67854-08-R-3025.  The previously issued Presolicitation Notice announced that the upcoming procurement would be issued as a total small business set-aside.  This has now changed.  Based on market research, information was received that gave the Contracting Officer reasonable expectation that offers in response to any resultant solicitation would be received from at least two Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small businesses and at fair market prices.  Therefore, this commercial procurement is now being issued as a total (HUBZone) small business set-aside under authority of FAR Part 19.1305.  Any offer submitted to the resultant solicitation shall be in compliance with FAR 52.219-3 and 52.219-14.  This is a Presolicitation Notice only; no proposals are being requested at this time.  The Marine Corps System Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense Systems, has a requirement for General Purpose Shelters with 512 to 650 square feet of floor space.  These shelters are to provide environmental protection for the United States Marine Corps field forces during the entire spectrum of military operations.  Shelters shall include the following requirements: they shall be mobile, durable, terrain-adaptable, all-weather, lightweight and have the ability to be quickly erected and struck and be suitable for use in the wide range of environmental conditions encountered during military operations.  The estimated quantity is a maximum of 3,400 shelters.  The NAICS code is 314912, Canvas and Related Product Mills, with a size standard of 500.  Award will be made to the responsible HUBZone offeror whose offer represents the best value to the government, considering price and other factors.  
The shelters will primarily be evaluated against stringent Go/No-Go criteria.  These criteria are snow load, rain intrusion, wind load, detectability, and flame resistance.  Shelters failing to meet one or more of the requirements stated in the forthcoming solicitation will be eliminated from the competition.  The Government will use certified test data to verify snow load, rain intrusion and wind load.  The Government will use certified test data and exterior fabric certifications (i.e. opacity) from the fabric manufacturers for detectability (including blackout capability and near infrared signature).  The Government will use certifications from the fabric manufacturers to verify flame resistance for the following component fabrics: exterior material, liner, plenum and floor.  Test methods will be identified in the forthcoming solicitation.  All certified test data/test reports and certifications required MUST be submitted with the offerors proposal.  The test data/test reports and certifications the offeror submits as part of the written proposal shall CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE the proposed shelter meets all elements of these Go/No-Go criteria, as well as other requirements of the solicitation.  If the offeror proposes a modified shelter design/model different from that reflected in the certified test/data reports and certifications and/or an alternate test method/certification than the methods/certifications identified, the offeror shall clearly explain any and all differences between the two.  Such detailed explanation shall include why the submitted test data/certifications are technically relevant to the requirements and why additional testing on the proposed shelter is not required.  If the test data/certifications and/or the explanation/justification submitted fails to satisfactorily address or meet these criteria, the offeror will be eliminated from consideration for award. 
Evaluation factors in addition to the Go/No-Go criteria will also be set forth in the forthcoming solicitation.  It is anticipated that Solicitation No. M67854-08-R-3025 will be issued in August 2008 and will be posted on the internet at the Federal Business Opportunities website located at the following address:     http://www.fedbizopps.gov, and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  The on-line version of the solicitation will include all documents of the solicitation package.  No hard copy of this solicitation will be issued.  Amendments, if any, will be posted at the same location as the original solicitation.  The complete solicitation package, including amendments, should be received and reviewed prior to submitting a response.  The proposal shall be submitted in hard copy form only.  No electronic submission of proposals will be accepted.  Those responding to the solicitation have the responsibility to obtain all amendments and/or other applicable documents.   Offerors are instructed to hold all questions until the solicitation has been issued.  Offerors shall submit ALL questions in writing to lisandra.torres@usmc.mil.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  All items, materials, and components thereof submitted shall be in full compliance with the Berry Amendment (10 U.S.C 2533a), as modified in the National Defense Authorization Act for 2006 (Public Law 109-163) signed 6 January 2006.  Offerors may be required to provide detailed information certifying compliance.  In order to be eligible for award, interested parties must be registered into the Central Contractor Database (CCR), http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on behalf of and as an agent of the Division of Strategic National Stockpile (DSNS) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified ventilators to be a necessity for pandemic flu preparedness and response.  The purpose of this solicitation is to award an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract for portable ventilators (all same make and model) with delivery to stockpile location(s) in support of pandemic flu preparedness and response.  Resulting awardee shall also be capable of providing re-supply kits, along with end-user training and sustain a 60-month (five year) maintenance support agreement that will include rotation of approximately one third of the ventilators shipping from Government location to offerors location for annual preventative and recertification maintenance.  The objective is to insure availability and consistency of product for stockpile and if need be, deployment in the event of pandemic flu outbreak.  The base contract period will be for one year (or less, depending on date of award), with one (4) option periods that may be exercised by the Government.   It is the Governments desire that the contractor shall provide consistent deliveries of portable ventilators and re-supply kits within an 18-month period.  Offerors are requested to propose a delivery schedule that can be accomplished within this timeframe or sooner and if not within this timeframe, include appropriate reasons why not.  Delivery shall be within the continental United States.  NOTE: Due to the national security and sensitive aspects of this program, information such as final delivery location(s) and point of contact(s) are considered confidential and as such shall only be disclosed to the resultant awardee.  Due to the confidential and sensitive nature of this procurement the contractor and affiliates shall be required to complete a confidentiality agreement within five (5) days of award.  Offeror must be able to provide standard commercial warranty term of at least one year after date of shipment as part of the mandatory characteristics (minimum requirements).  Because of the uniqueness of the DSNS stockpile program and this related procurement, the Government desires a warranty term that would begin at the point of 1st deployment of ventilators and continue through one year.  Offerors are encouraged to consider this optional characteristic provision and to include their response to this provision in the business proposal.  This provision as it is offered will be included in the price analysis portion of the evaluation.  Distributors/dealers are required to submit a letter from the manufacturer/s of the offered portable ventilators guaranteeing a source of supply for the term of the contract.  This letter must be from the manufacturer and on the manufacturers stationary.  Offers from distributors/dealers that do not submit the letter of commitment from the manufacturer will be rejected.
