<DESC>This Draft RFP is issued by HQ AFSOC/A7KQ to solicit responses, questions, suggestions from qualified offerors prior to the official solicitation.  Prospective offerors are invited to submit written comments, suggestions or questions via email to Diana R. Graziano at diana.graziano@hurlburt.af.mil no later than 2:00 p.m. CST on or before 2 December 2011.  When responding reference Draft RFP FA0021-12-R-0001 CV-22 CMS.  All answers to questions submitted will be posted to FedBizOpps.  Suggestions and comments may or may not be posted, however will be considered before posting the official RFP.

This Draft Solicitation provides for a non-personal services contract to augment the Government by providing CV-22 aircraft maintenance support.  It is anticipated to be a Competitive 8(a) acquisition approved by SBA with Requirement Number 0491/12/200137.  This acquisition is planned to consist of a base period of 12-months and 4 option periods.  Additionally, it is anticipated there will be a few Optional CLINs that may or may not be executed pending Government need, approvals and/or funding.  These options are detailed in the solicitation.  This requirement is for CV-22 Contractor Maintenance Support Augmentation.  It is planned to be a Fixed Price contract with reimbursable CLINs.  Due to the nature of this service, augmenting military units, the contractor does not have “ownership” of any of the maintenance functions.  Therefore, this requirement is not considered “performance based.”  The Government is providing details, number of CMEs, and locations for these services (see Attachment 1, Level of Support / Growth); however, the offeror is still required to meet all Statement of Work (SOW) requirements to include deliverables and Service Delivery Summary thresholds.  The periods of performance are as follows:  

Base Period:  1 April 2011 – 31 March 2012
Option Period 1:  1 April 2012 – 31 March 2013
Option Period 2:  1 April 2013 – 31 March 2014
Option Period 3:  1 April 2014 – 31 March 2015
Option Period 4:  1 April 2015 – 31 March 2016 


This requirement provides for non-personal Contractor Maintenance Support (CMS) services to Hurlburt Field, Florida; Kirtland AFB, New Mexico; Cannon AFB, New Mexico; and RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom with an estimated start of 1 April 2013.  The plan for the Optional Mildenhall start up is to man 66% in option period one and 100% for the remaining periods (see Attachment 1, Level of Support/Growth).  There is potential for a future base in the PACOM with a start date to be determined later.  The CV-22 aircraft have the primary missions of combat and training missions driving both CONUS and O-CONUS support requirements.  The CV-22 is a weapons system that currently has limited organic maintenance capability.  Because of that limited capability and the complexity of the aircraft, the maintenance concept is a combined effort of Air Force and Contractor Maintenance Support (CMS) technicians.  Both Air Force and CMS technicians are responsible for Organizational level (O-level) and Intermediate level (I-level) maintenance.  The CV-22 aircraft located at Hurlburt Field, FL; Cannon AFB, NM; and RAF Mildenhall, UK, and potential for a future base in the PACOM AOR are operational assets that will be deployed overseas to conduct and support AFSOC operations.  CMS personnel assigned at those locations will be required to deploy or perform temporary duty world-wide in support of CV-22 mission requirements.  Contractor personnel at Kirtland AFB, NM will be required to support CONUS TDY operations.

The CMS service provider shall provide V-22 experienced maintenance production supervision and personnel to execute all Organizational and applicable Intermediate (O and I)-level maintenance operations.

<DESC>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration intends to negotiate and award on a sole source basis to NTELX, Inc, under the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. This acquisition is in support of the Predictive Risk - Based Evaluation for Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT) system.
<p>PREDICT is an analytical tool that applies risk based targeting rules to import entry lines for which FDA must make admissibility decisions each year on regulated products. The risk scoring supports FDA's mission by helping to identify regulated products that may be more volatile, thus improving FDA's ability to protect health. Specific NTELX software modules allow FDA to input and extract information into a proprietary relational database that provides the baseline architecture for the capture, aggregation, and representation of data pertaining to entry lines that will be profiled to encompass all FDA regulated products and all ports of entry. FDA has a perpetual license.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions-Neuroscience, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to Illumina, Inc., 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, CA  92121-1975 for the purchase of Fifty-Three (53) units of the HumanExome BeadChip (48 samples), Part Number WG-353-1001-PRE, four (4) units of the HumanOmni2.5-8v1 DNA Analysis BeadChip (96 samples), Part Number WG-311-2513 and two (2) units of the HumanOmni2.5-8v1 DNA Analysis BeadChip (16 samples), Part Number WG-311-2511.  NIMH will use these DNA analyses tools to continue and expand on-going research projects.  

The Classification Code is 66 – Instruments and Laboratory Equipment and the North American Industry Classification Code is 334516 – Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing.  The business size standard is 500 employees.

NIMH will use these custom DNA analysis tools to analyze additional DNA samples collected for an on-going project that explores single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variants in the genome of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls in diverse populations.  These tools will also be used to expand on data that will replicate prior findings and add statistical power and strengthen the research findings. All the DNA analyses will be performed on the Illumina GA2 Analyzer which is already in operation in NIMH’s lab. 

Using Illumina beadchips, NIMH have already genotyped the majority of the genomic DNAs in the CBDB/GCAP Sibling Study, which is part of the Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the NIMH.  NIMH will finish genotyping these samples using these beadchips. Through a consortium, Illumina has developed a comprehensive Exome array focusing on functionally relevant markers. This chip will enhance genome-wide association studies with high-value exonic content. The markers consist of 250,000 loci selected from more than 12,000 whole genome sequences and exome sequences. Another unique feature of this chip is that biological marker selection was based on functionally relevant SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) which are  >50% non-synonymous, >95% within coding regions, and >20% are at exome splice sites from a pooled dataset derived from diverse populations.

In addition, Illumina HumanOmni2.58v1 DNA Analysis Beadchips contains millions of genome-wide common and rare variant alleles from the 1,000 Genomes Project to maximize its ability to detect new associations. NIMH have used this chip previously and the Omni2.5 beadchips provides unprecedented genome coverage for both single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and copy number variant (CNV) analyses, while retaining industry data quality and standards as well as a simple workflow making these arrays the gold standard in GWAS analysis tool.  

These beadchips are proprietary to Illumina and no other manufacturer provides these chips with the specifications required to be seamlessly incorporated into NIMH’s current data analyses.  These beadchips will allow NIMH to complete DNA analysis on additional samples added to their on-going DNA project which were previously analyzed using these beadchips 


The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 12-Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR Subpart 13.5 Test Program for Commercial Items.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by submitting a statement of capabilities on or before 10:00 AM E.T., November 25, 2011 to Korriise LaRoche, larochek@mail.nih.gov.  All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NIA to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award from the NIDA, the vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, the vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at ww.ccr.gov.  Please reference announcement number NOI-2348071 on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, Panama City, Florida intends to award, on a sole source basis, a firm fixed purchase order to DRS Universal Power Systems, 4230 Lafayette Center Drive, Suite G, Chantilly, VA 20151, to provide:

QTY 114-Global Uninterruptible Power Supplies (P/N 2000TR-IV),  
QTY 114- Input Power Cords for 2000TR-IV, 
QTY 57- External Battery Cabinet (P/N B20TR-IV), & 
QTY 57- 6ft. External Battery Connection Cables (P/N GXT3CABLE48V6).  

This procurement is sole source for the following reasons. The Deplayable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) is a major Informational Technology (IT) investment and is designated a major automated information system program.
 The DJC2 engineering systems team considers and integrates design and implementation activities throughout the entire DJC2 life cycle. Each DJC2 part has been tested to perform to rigid requirements for power consumption, power input, temperature, interoperability, Informational Assurance (IA), reliability, security, and safety prior to becoming part of the DJC2 baseline. The parts required were certified for use with the DJC2 system and were identified as the only approved part on the source control drawings. The only approved manufacturer of these parts is DRS Universal Power Systems. 

Any deviation from the approved products baseline will impact the ability of DJC2 to meeting operational requirements, cause substantial duplication of cost to the United States which is not expected to be recovered through competition and will cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencyâ€™s needs.
 

The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination. The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price purchase order. The closing date of the synopsis is 9 December 2011. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 335999, and the small business size standard is 500 employees. The Department of Defense will no longer award contracts to contractors not registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.
 Registration may be accomplished by accessing the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov/. A paper form may be obtained from the Department of Defense Electronic Commerce Information center at 1-888-227-2423. 

The basis for award will be a fair and reasonable price. The award will be made on or about 12/19/2011.

<DESC>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC" or "Commission") intends to award a sole source contract to LexisNexis for a 12 month subscription to Early Data Analyzer Basic Bundle and Early Data Analyzer Export Bundle. These are add-on modules to the Commission's existing LAW PreDiscovery EDD processing software. The modules provide early data analysis and support the culling of irrelevant data from the full LAW processing and inclusion in Concordance databases. LexisNexis is the only known source for these modules. This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers and, as such, no solicitation is available. However, the Government will consider responses from all responsible sources received by the response date and time identified in this synopsis. Written responses must include sufficient information to establish capability to fulfill the requirement. Any responses received will only be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in lieu of the sole source contract described in this notice, and such determination shall be made at the sole discretion of CFTC.

<DESC>Synopsis:<br />The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services for the U.S. Embassy Panama City, Panama. The U.S. Embassy requires a secure environment to conduct its mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The estimated number of annual hours for guard services at this location is approximately <strong>190,092</strong> hours. The Contractor shall be required to provide services that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel; dependents; property; destruction of assets; prevent unauthorized access; and, deter potential terrorist attacks. <br /><br />
<p>Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government). All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract. The Government plans to post the solicitation in late December 2011. No paper copies will be mailed. All prospective offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award. All offers must comply with all applicable Panamanian law. Prospective offerors are encouraged to carefully review Ley 56 and Ley 57, as published in Panama's Gaceta Oficial No. 26795-A and No. 26795-B. <strong>The Government will solicit this requirement as a small business set aside. Offers from other than small businesses will not be considered. <br /><br /></strong>The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: The synopsis will be posted followed by the solicitation as soon as available after the required posting of the synopsis for 15 days. Then the Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) period begins. Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately 60 days to submit proposals. All dates are subject to change and Offerors will be notified by registering on https://www.fbo.gov. Site Visit attendance is not mandatory, but highly encouraged. A site visit is expected to be scheduled approximately three to four weeks after the solicitation is posted. Offerors are responsible for entry visa (if required); all travel arrangements, local transportation, and accommodations. Due to space limitations, only two (2) representatives from each firm will be allowed for the conference and site visit. No questions will be answered concerning this requirement until the solicitation is posted.</p>
<p>Once the solicitation is posted, questions may be submitted by email to Winkle Nemeth at nemethww@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. In accordance with 22 U.S.C. Section 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the lowest price, technically acceptable proposal.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Project Title: Invitation for Bids - Construct New Dormitory<br><br>Location: Thule Air Base, Greenland <br><br>Note: This solicitation and award is restricted, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c )(4) International Agreement, to Danish and Greenlandic firms.  <br> <br>Synopsis:<br><br>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue a solicitation package seeking to award a firm-fixed price contract for the construction of a new, 4,550 SM, 3-story dormitory facility.  This will be a competitive, Invitation for Bids, bid opening. The facility will be built with arctic foundations in the permafrost, it will be steel frame, insulated panel exterior and pitched metal roof. The work includes site improvements, all utilities and communications.  The contractor will furnish all supervision, plant, labor, materials, tools, and equipment to construct the facility.  General Conditions at Thule Air Base:  The location of Thule Air Base limits exterior work to the months of June through September, although work is sometimes possible in May or October.

Shipping schedules are dictated by Defense contracts, and materials and labor are not available locally.   The region is glaciated and the existing soil is generally permafrost, which exists from 1 to 6 feet below the surface and to a measured depth of 1,600 feet. Average winter temperature is 20-30 degrees F below zero while average summer temperature is 40-50 degrees F above zero.  One annual military cargo sealift departs from Norfolk, Virginia to Thule AB, approximately 1 July.  There are two sealifts that go from Copenhagen, Denmark to Thule AB, one in July & one in August. Airlifting any materials or equipment via military aircraft is very expensive and only on an emergency-need basis.  The project magnitude is over $20 million.

<DESC>This DRAFT Statement of Objective (SOO) is for informational purposes only.  The actual solicitation will posted in approximately 60 days.


1.0  	Background

The current commercial off the shelf (COTS) mobile devices that are available on or off the Nationwide-Department of the Navy Wireless Contracts (NDWC) or the Army Air Force Blanket Purchase Agreements do not provide an approved architecture for accessing multiple enclaves (e.g., internet, Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPR), Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPR), etc.) and processing and storing sensitive information which could adversely affect national security if compromised. The National Security Agency offers a procurement method to government entities via IDIQ contracts for purchasing mobile devices capable of accessing multiple domains.
 The devices offered by these contracts do not meet the requirements listed in this solicitation. For example, the devices contain various technologies (Controlled COMSEC Item, (CCI)) that preclude them from being sold commercially. 

2.0	Purpose. 

The purpose of this procurement is to establish a working relationship between the government and commercial consortiums in order to advance the development of commercial mobile device technology, beneficial to the U.S. government (i.e., DoD) by providing a capability to access multiple security domains. After completion of the period of performance, it is planned that the devices will be commercially available to the general public and to the government via the federal wireless contracts (e.g., the Nationwide Department of the Navyâ€™s Wireless Contracts [NDWC], the Army Air Force Blanket Purchase Agreement [AAFBPA] and U.S.
 General Services Administration  [GSA] contract, etc.). This intended multiple award procurement is needed to provide a mechanism for incentivizing the commercial industry consortiums to adopt government desired handheld device security characteristics. The resulting contract will be a means for the government to partner with commercial consortiums that are already developing technology similar to the governmentâ€™s handheld device security requirements.

3.0	Program Goals/Scope

The scope of this solicitation covers the Marine Corpsâ€™ requirements for secure mobile handheld devices. As part of the proposal submission for this solicitation the offerors must present a demonstration of the multiple domain technology that would satisfy the requirements listed in this solicitation.
 At the conclusion of each period of performance the contractor must deliver a multi-domain capable architecture implemented on mobile devices including the deliverables listed in CDRLs. 

The following paragraphs describe the basic objectives of the trusted handheld effort and are provided in lieu of a Government Statement of Work (SOW). This approach provides offerors the flexibility to develop cost effective solutions and the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives meeting the stated objectives. It also presents the Government with an opportunity to assess the offerorsâ€™ understanding of all aspects of the effort to be performed by eliminating unnecessary â€˜how toâ€™ instructions historically contained in a Government provided SOW.
 

4.0  Objectives 

Proposed Program Implementation. The offerors shall propose their Performance-Based approach to achieve the requirements within the performance criteria listed in the minimum and optional requirements of the solicitation. The intent of the collaborative consortium between the government and industry is to establish clear requirements and collectively influence development of mobile devices towards including mutually beneficial security characteristics. The resulting framework should help reduce cost, speed time-to-market, and reduce complexity of the devices. Early collaboration in the development phases should help reduce the impact of long certification processes. The goal for the resulting technology is to become a standard commercial product offered by mobile device original equipment manufacturers using the same hardware and software technologies used in consumer-only devices.
 The resulting devices must support modular additions without re-engineering or re-architecting the solutions to meet the required security controls for the high security domains. The government assumes the partnered consortia will leverage their internal research and development budgets with a common understanding that the resulting technology supports much larger interests. The approach(es) shall:

4.0.1  Describe the offerorâ€™s approach to continually evolve the initial proposed product line into the next set of mutually beneficial mobile devices. For example, how does the offeror propose to penetrate the mobile commercial market to support broader market adoption?

4.0.2  Explain in as much detail as possible how domain separation, process isolation, and resource encapsulation is provided for the mobile device components such as the human machine interface (e.g., display and keyboard), multi-core processor, graphics processing unit, baseband processor, and the shared hardware root of trust.

4.0.3  Describe how the mobile devices security architecture embodies the security principles of modularity and simplicity.

4.1.
 Strategic Sourcing has been identified in this requirement. During the performance of the contract(s), the Government and the contractor(s) will work together, much like in a partnership, towards shared goals and objectives. The goals and objectives include:

4.1.1 Securely send voice, video, and data across multiple security domains using mobile devices without perceived degradation.

4.1.2 Mobile communications across multiple wireless networks (e.g., Personal Area Network [PAN], Wireless Local Access Netwok [WLAN], Wide Area Network [WAN]).

4.1.3 Produce secure mobile COTS devices.

4.1.4 Mobile communication interoperability with international networks.

5.1 Minimum Requirements.
 

5.1.0 Description. The following list of requirements represents the governmentâ€™s minimum set of desired device characteristics. The paragraphs provide the governments rationale behind each requirement. The paragraph headers are defined in paragraph 5.1. All proposed architectures must, at an absolute minimum, include all of the following characteristics. 

5.2.1 Isolation Technology (e.g.,  separation kernel, security kernel, etc.). The isolation technology shall isolate the software components, control the intra-domain access and isolate the other resources on the devices. This capability is expected to support a wide range of highly sensitive security domains. The isolation technology shall provide trustworthy data paths for the user interfaces and peripherals.
 The base isolation technology shall be read-only to restrict after OEM build time (i.e., following the OEMâ€™s initial build). However, this will not eliminate the enterpriseâ€™s ability to configure the isolation technologyâ€™s policy enforcement (i.e., resource interaction). The isolation technology facilitates the ability for the user to securely access information residing on different domains within the device. 

5.2.2 Multi-personality. The devices must be capable of supporting multiple personalities on a single handset. These personalities may manifest carrier operating systems or enterprise owned operating system. The intent is to provide a handheld device architecture that will support unmodified user managers (i.e., guest mobile operating systems) and prevent the unnecessary consumption of valuable computing resources.
 Example methods for obtaining multiple personalities include the use of: Advanced Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) Machine [ARM] Virtual Extensions (VE), Intel Virtualization Technology (VT), etc.
	
5.2.3 Commercial Standards. All devices must leverage commercial standards for designs and documentation (e.g., device I/O). If the devices leverage commercial standards, then parallel developments are possible with minimal interoperability conflicts.

5.2.4 Common Product Line Architecture Across Multiple Platforms. The proposals must address how the proposed architecture will be developed for multiple handheld devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, etc.).

5.3 Optional Capabilities

5.3.0 Description.
 Submitted proposals are not required to meet any optional capability. However, the optional capabilities represent the governmentâ€™s desire for a more secure architecture. Proposals that meet more of these capabilities will rank above others that fail to include these characteristics. The requirements are divided in groups based on desirability and listed within the groups in descending order of importance.

5.3.1 Desirable Capabilities (High)

5.3.1.1  Hardware root of trust (e.g., Trusted Platform Module[TPM]). A hardware root of trust shall be provided to facilitate secure key storage.

5.3.1.2 Trusted Boot Loader. The boot loader architecture and implementation shall provide integrity for the boot sequence.
 For example, the boot loader should be resistant to software attacks (e.g. â€œjail breakingâ€).

5.3.1.3  Multiple Active User Domains . The devices shall execute multiple user domains simultaneously with each only having access to its assigned resources. If this optional requirement is chosen, the domain indicator option must be implemented (i.e.,  providing the user verification of the active domain.)

5.3.2.3.2 Application. The devices shall support the installation of a third party device management application hosted in the supervisor domain. Having the management application running in the supervisor domain is intended to increase the integrity and availability of the application. Since the application is critical for controlling the security policy, the application shall reside in the supervisor domain.

5.3.2.4  Multi-core Processor. The devices shall use a multi-core processor.
 As multiple core technology begins proliferating in mobile devices, special attention needs to be given to the implementation. If the proposed solutions leverage multi-core processing, the resulting technology should help establish a baseline approach for further development.

5.3.2.5 Personality Creation Flexibility. The devices shall support the creation of an arbitrary number of â€œdomainsâ€ and the ability to populate those domains with enterprise security solutions. 

5.3.2.6  Fail Secure. The devices shall provide fail secure operation so that events that can result in unauthorized inter-domain data flows shall stop current operations and restart the devices or load a designated domain image.
 This must protect against unauthorized release of, or access to, sensitive information.

5.3.2.7 Fail for Availability. The devices shall provide fail for availability operation. The purpose is to allow corrupted virtual machines to restart. The devices shall have the ability to load master images when the guest images are corrupted. For example, if the environment within the guest image is corrupted and fails to operate,  the device will restart and load the master image. 

5.3.2.8 Memory Sanitization. The devices shall provide the ability to overwrite any physical location in flash memory. To meet this requirement the proposal must describe the overwrite capability and any involvement of bad block management and wear leveling mechanisms.
5.3.2.8.1 Enterprise Reset â€“ the ability to locally reset the device to original enterprise provisioned state.
5.3.2.8.2 Pristine Reset - the ability to locally reset the device to initial factory state.
 
5.3.2.8.3 Remote Reset - the ability to remotely activate a pristine or enterprise reset.

5.3.2.9 Hardware Integrity Verifications. There shall be a method to validate the integrity of the device hardware. Unauthorized component identification. Via external verification methods the deviceâ€™s hardware components shall be verified to include detecting unauthorized components. The purpose of external verification is to mitigate against unauthorized modifications of the hardware.
5.3.2.9.1 Power-On Selfâ€“Test. At boot-up, the devices shall perform simple health checks and alerts the user if any failures are detected.

5.3.2.10 Tamper Evident Hardware. The device sâ€™ security critical hardware shall be tamper evident..
 This requirement is intended to provide some additional hardware protections against reverse engineering and malicious modifications. 

5.3.3 Desirable Capabilities (Low)

5.3.3.1 Basic Software Integrity Attestation. The devices shall be capable measuring and attesting to the state of the user environment, security components and core system software. The following components are desired to verify the integrity of the software. The proposals must specify how a successful integrity check is displayed to the user.
5.3.3.1.1 Secure Boot Loader. Attestation shall be provided for the boot process to include the isolation technology.
5.3.3.1.2 Isolation Technology. There shall be a process that verifies the integrity of the isolation technology configuration parameters that are loaded on startup.
5.3.2.1.3 Supervisor Domain.
 Configuration parameters shall be verified including the executable of additional processes installed in the supervisor domain.
5.3.2.1.4 Domains other than the Supervisor Domain. Integrity checks shall be performed as those domains are loaded.

5.3.3.2 External Cryptography. The devices shall support external cryptography. For example, with the external cryptography functionality, the user could insert a secure digital (SD) card with an embedded microprocessor to facilitate an encryption capability independent of the inherent processors. The intent of this requirement is to facilitate data-at-rest and data-in-transit encryption for access to highly sensitive networks.

5.3.3.3 Suite B Cryptography.
 The devices shall contain the ability to encrypt data with a FIPS 140-2 and NSA certified implementation. The intent is to enable the devices to process sensitive data on U.S. Government networks.

5.3.3.4 Protected Storage. The devices shall provide data-at rest-protection for the domains. This may be accomplished through whole disk encryption, file system encryption, and OS image encryption. The selection of key, algorithm, and storage location shall be selectable per domain (e.g., hardware root of trust, Suite B SD microprocessor, or installed SD card). 


5.3.3.5 Carrier aware dual personalities. The devices shall support multiple network personalities. The devices shall be configurable to assign the carrier identification information to different domains.
 For example, the devices could be equipped with a personal Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) and a business SIM where the personal SIM is paid for by the consumer, and the business SIM is paid for by the organization. Additionally, this facilitates the ability for the carrier identification information to support network authentication. For example, personal domain accesses network via personal SIM credentials and business domain access network via business SIM credentials).

5.3.3.6 Messaging . The devices shall provide message transport between supervisor and user domains. This shall include security relevant event messages  originating from the isolation technology layer . Any message presented to user must be capable of being stored and accessible within an audit log.

5.3.3.7  Sideloading.
 The devices shall be capable of loading software and data through external interfaces. This provides the capability of loading software and data locally vice over- the-air.

5.3.3.8  Auditing. The devices shall be capable of auditing security relevant events (e.g., boot events, fail secure events, configuration changes, etc.). The devices shall protect the audit trail, provide a means of exporting the audit trail from the devices, and a means of clearing the audit trail. Understanding comprehensive internal auditing can monopolize the devicesâ€™ resources, the offerors must distinguish where each audit function will occur (i.e., internal to the device or in the enterprise).

<DESC>The US Army Research Development Engineering Command, Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA, is conducting a Request for Information for Concept (White) Papers on Personal Augmentation Technologies for the Warfighter and Homeland Defender. This IS NOT a Request for Proposal. <br><br>Today's Warfighters and Homeland Defenders are increasingly weighed down by more and more advanced equipment capabilities. Individually, these equipment capabilities are valuable for mission success, but collectively they far exceed weights recommended for maximum load carriage. As a result, this load burden reduces team and individual mobility and causes acute and chronic injuries, negatively impacting mission effectiveness and readiness. In addition, future capabilities will continually be modernized with additional advanced equipment capabilities, with trends leading to even higher weights carried by individuals.<br><br>Innovative approaches to personal augmentation technologies are sought for Warfighters and Homeland Defenders.  Technologies and concepts that provide improvements in strength, endurance and/or ergonomics while maintaining user safety and reducing muscular fatigue, physical injury, and soreness during various load carriage and various tasks, are of interest. Example load carriage tasks include heavy and repetitive lifting, load transport, and difficult load tasks in unique environments. Ease of use and integration with current and future user clothing and individual mission equipment are factors of interest. Long operating life from a reliable power source, and low cost are also factors of interest.<br><br>There are 4 specific personal augmentation technology types sought:<br>1.	Agility - Lightweight, low-powered, quick reaction physiological assist device for dismounted users. Injury reduction, high mobility, and endurance are key focuses.<br>2.	Support - Physiological assist device that helps wearer to conduct sustainment and logistics tasks including heavy supply lifting, loading, unloading, and transporting at a Forward Operating Base (FOB) or alike. Injury reduction, strength assist, and throughput/production augmentation are key focuses.<br>3.	Extreme Support - Specialized physiological assist device designed for specific tasks in extreme environments. Able to interface with special tools to conduct specific tasks. Example users include wild land firefighters and urban search and rescue. Injury reduction, strength assist, and high mobility are key focuses.<br>4.	Depot / Industrial - Specialized physiological assist device designed for specific tasks in unique depot environments. Able to interface with special tools to conduct specific tasks. Injury, stress, and fatigue reduction and throughput/production augmentation are key focuses.<br><br>Personal augmentation systems proposed must align with at least 1 of the 4 types above and will be compared with the conventional solutions in the field or in development to determine their technical viability. <br><br>All interested firms, regardless of size are encouraged to submit a Concept (White) Paper to NSRDEC in accordance with NSRDEC Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 11-13, under topic # C16- Future Warrior Technology Integration, which can be found at https://www3.natick.army.mil/. Offerors shall submit concept papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA. Instructions for the submission of concept papers are contained in BAA Topic # C16. "Future Warrior Technology Integration." Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government. Nothing shall be construed herein or through the RFI process to commit or obligate the Government to further action as a result of this RFI. Firms responding to this RFI shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information, and all information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the Government, and will not be returned to the submitter.

<SUBJECT>Economic Evaluation of HIV Care and Prevention Strategies

<CONTACT>Sherrie N. Randall, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882866, Fax 7704882868, Email iom2@cdc.gov - Julio E Lopez, Lead Contract Specialist, Phone 770-488-2892, Fax 770-488-2868, Email ftg4@cdc.gov
<DESC><br />This is a sources sought announcement to determine the availability of potential vendors (including, but not limited to, small business (e.g. 8 (a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantage business, and women-owned small business) that can provide support to the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention to provide economic evaluation, cost effective analyses, and technical assistance for HIV Care and Prevention Strategies.<br /><br /><strong>Background:</strong>
<p><br />As a part of its overall public health mission, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides leadership in helping control the HIV epidemic by working with community, state, national, and international partners in surveillance, research, and prevention and evaluation activities. In July, 2010, President Barack Obama unveiled the first National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) for the United States. To accomplish one of its three key goals, Reduce New HIV Infections, the Strategy calls for ensuring that prevention resources be more strategically concentrated in specific communities at high risk for HIV infection; allocating public funding to geographic areas consistent with the epidemic; and designing, evaluating, and implementing innovative prevention strategies and combination approaches for preventing HIV in high-risk communities.</p>
<p>In direct support of NHAS, the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP), a unit of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP), funded a three-year, high impact prevention demonstration project to facilitate the development and implementation of Enhanced Comprehensive HIV Prevention Plans (ECHPPs) in 12 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) most affected by the HIV epidemic. As the grantees were encouraged to prioritize their intervention plans based on strong scientific evidence, DHAP began a systematic review of published cost-effectiveness analyses of HIV prevention interventions. What became clear from the results of this effort was that gaps exist in the literature on the cost-effectiveness of evidence-based HIV prevention interventions. Few, or no, published analyses were found for 7 of the 14 required interventions. Since the ECHPP approach is now the basis of the larger $359 million Health Department Prevention Funding Announcement for all areas, the dearth of costing data and other modeling literature is even more critical. Economic evaluations of HIV prevention and care interventions provide stakeholders with tools to set priorities for high-risk populations, and to quantify and communicate the impact of priority setting.</p>
<p>DHAP requires the support of an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract to acquire support in the following areas: 1) economic evaluation including cost-effectiveness analyses of single and combination HIV prevention interventions; 2) literature reviews and summaries of cost and cost-effectiveness analyses of HIV prevention strategies; 3) modeling of optimal HIV prevention funding allocations among populations and programs; 4) quantitative policy analyses of HIV prevention policies, guidelines, and practices; 5) technical assistance for CDC to provide state and local health departments assistance to optimize their HIV prevention portfolios; and 6) other HIV prevention cost data collection and analyses, as required.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to provide the CDC with rapid turnaround to obtain required services related to high impact public health activities in priority areas related to cost-effectiveness to help guide the most efficient use of HIV prevention funds. These services could include, but are not limited to:<br />-&nbsp;Conducting cost-effectiveness analyses focused on newly emerging single interventions;<br />-&nbsp;Conducting comparative cost-effectiveness analyses of the impact of multiple interventions as <br />delivered to specific populations;<br />-&nbsp;Examining resource allocation models to identify and understand the underlying commonalities, <br />assumptions, and model structures among cost-effective resource models and to identify complex approaches for optimizing the impact of HIV care and prevention at the national and local levels;<br />-&nbsp;Conducting high level analyses that look at potential policy changes and their cost-effectiveness <br />at the national level;<br />-Conducting literature searches, collection of costing data in the field, and review of existing <br />costing data at CDC and elsewhere;<br />-Providing technical assistance and capacity building mechanisms to CDC in order improve state <br />and local health departments utilization of appropriate models and optimize their HIV <br />prevention portfolios.</p>
<p>These efforts may also involve time and motion studies, policy assessments, epidemic modeling, consultations and workshops, and related support as detailed in each request for Task Order proposal issued.</p>

<DESC>This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement. Small Businesses are encouraged to respond.
<p>BACKGROUND: <br />The Laboratory of Epidemiology, Demography and Biometry (LEDB), an intramural research laboratory of the National Institute on Aging (NIA), will support through a research contract, a clinical research project, the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility -Reykjavik Study (AGES-Reykjavik). The purpose of this study is continued analysis and scientific exploration of the AGES-Reykjavik cohort by means of data analysis, hospital, nursing home, and death records abstraction, and ancillary projects. The primary aims of the requirement are:</p>
<p>AIM 1: Perform core study functions, consisting of study management and communication, ongoing outcomes ascertainment from medical and death records, maintenance of and access to biological specimen and image repositories, and data management, to allow for continued analysis of the AGES-Reykjavik Study data.</p>
<p>AIM 2: Perform genomic analysis on traits collected in previous contracts for the AGES-Reykjavik Study.</p>
<p>AIM 3: Initiate and conduct ancillary studies in the AGES-Reykjavik Study cohort or in its offspring.</p>
<p>The Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study was initiated in 2001 by the Laboratory of Epidemiology, Demography, and Biometry of the NIA's Intramural Research Program to examine genetic susceptibility and gene/environment interaction as these contribute to traits and phenotypes common in old age. As the effects of aging are multi-system, AGES included four related biologic systems: neurocognitive (cognition, dementia, depression, neurosensory (vision, hearing, balance); cardiovascular (atherosclerosis, arterial distensibility, ventricular and valvular disease); musculoskeletal (spine and hip osteoporosis, hip osteoarthritis, strength and function); and body composition and metabolism (obesity, sarcopenia, and hyperglycemia/diabetes). These biologic systems were chosen based on the hypothesis that genes in pathways, such as inflammation or glucose metabolism, could contribute to phenotypes both within and across these systems.</p>
<p>The AGES-Reykjavik Study participants were recruited from survivors of the Reykjavik Study (RS), a longitudinal cohort study of men and women born in 1907 through 1934 in Iceland who were examined at least once and up to six times for cardiovascular risk by the Icelandic Heart Association (IHA). This nested design allows for better assessment of traits because earlier life traits generally are associated with greater heritability and are less likely to be affected by concurrent illnesses in old age. A cost-sharing research contract between the NIA and the IHA started in 2001 to carry-out the first "old-age" clinic and home exams of the RS survivors. This baseline exam was conducted in 5,764 participants. Through the same contract, a second, follow-up clinic examination began in 2007 and 3,200 of the AGES-Reykjavik participants were examined. Through the course of the AGES-Reykjavik Study, information on outcomes and disease status has been supplemented by matching hospital, nursing home, and mortality records to the cohort. Numerous ancillary studies, through grants and additional NIH or IHA funding, have been conducted to take advantage of the opportunity of the extensive clinical information available on this cohort.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:</p>
<p>The study will be performed as a follow-up contract to the Age Gene/Environment Susceptibility - Reykjavik Study. The major focus of this new contract will be to continue to accumulate and share endpoints extracted from external databases; to maintain the biobank and image repositories; to continue analysis of genetic and epidemiologic data collected in the study; to continue the scientific work of this study by conducting studies of genetic transmission of selected phenotypes in offspring of AGES-Reykjavik Study participants; and to participate in state-of-the-art work on biomarkers.</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide the scientific infrastructure to maintain repositories of data, biospecimens, and images acquired throughout the AGES-Reykjavik Study and in any ancillary studies, to maintain health and vital status records, to provide data, biospecimens, or other materials that may be requested for collaborator research approved by the AGES-Reykjavik Study Executive Committee. The Contractor will also provide resources to carry out two ancillary studies that are anticipated under this Contract: one dealing with family structure and genetic transmission focused on the brain and the other a study of proteomics or metabolomics. The Contractor is expected to provide input into the content and feasibility of all aspects of the activities carried out as a part of this contract.</p>
<p>The following six goals shall satisfy NIA's requirement for this project:</p>
<p>A. Participate in the scientific direction of AGES-Reykjavik and provide study communication infrastructure for tracking of analysis projects, oversight of ancillary studies, and publications based on AGES-Reykjavik. <br />B. Provide data updates for hospitalization, nursing home admissions and assessments, vital status, and cause of death for all participants of the AGES-Reykjavik Study. <br />C. Conduct statistical analysis, data management, maintenance, and distribution of data files.<br />D. Provide scientific direction and analytic support for genetics research associated with AGES-Reykjavik.<br />E. Manage the maintenance and tracking of biologic specimens and MRI and CT images obtained in earlier AGES-Reykjavik contracts. <br />F. Provide infrastructure for new ancillary studies as needed or help to identify sources where these studies can be best performed.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS: The primary tasks for this acquisition include: A) Study Tasks and Phasing; Task 1. Study Administration, Task 2. Data Updates, Task 3. Data Analysis and Management, Task 4. Genotyping, Task 5. Genetics Analytic Support, Task 6. Central Storage Facility for Biologic Samples, Task 7. Maintain an Image Repository, Task 8. Ancillary Study of AGES-Reykjavik Participants and Offspring, Task 9. Ancillary Study on Biological Specimens or Images</p>
<p>Required Reports/Deliverables: The following reports will be required: A. Quarterly Progress Reports B. Final Report C. Data Sets</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The anticipated period of performance is four 12-month performance years from August 1, 2012 through July 31, 2016.</p>
<p>OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS: (1) The government is expected to use procedures in FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiations. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code will be 541712 with 500 Employees; and (2) Data Management System: The Contractor must use the data management system that was developed for AGES-Reykjavik Study. The Contractor must access participants enrolled in the AGES-Reykjavik Study and have access to previously used equipment to maintain continuity in any measures that might be done as part of ancillary studies. The Contractor shall maintain study-wide policies and procedures relevant to data usage and scientific productivity of the study. It is essential the Contractor provides optimal performance of services so there will be no discontinuity in work performance and that smooth continuation of the AGES-Reykjavik Study be maintained.</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal. It shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract as a result of this request for information.

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst NJ (NAWCADLKE) is requesting information from industry in order to identify qualified contractors interested in the development, production, installation and support Expeditionary Airfield (EAF) Sustainment Lighting System (SLS). SLS is a modernization of the current EAF Hardwire Lighting System. The objective of this Request for Information (RFI) is to assess industry's ability to develop the SLS. Information provided in response to this RFI will be used by the government in the development of its acquisition strategy. Material identified as Company Proprietary provided in response to this RFI will be treated as such by the government. Note that this program requires access to Export Controlled Technical Data and any interested parties must have an active, approved DD Form 2345. 

A single, scalable airfield lighting system capable of supporting operations from the intermediate phase (24-72 hours) to the semi-permanent phase (72 hours and beyond), is the objective capability of the EAF community. The ability to install an airfield lighting system and remain installed and operable semi-permanently is desired.

The EAF hardwire legacy lighting system has been in service for over 30 years and has reached a point of technological obsolescence leading to capability gaps and an inability of continued support. In order to address these issues, while still accomplishing the mission, the development of an SLS is being considered.

The following are notional high level system requirements:
- Capability of Category I Instrumented Flight Rules (IFR) and Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and non-precision IFR when appropriate.
- The utilization of solid state lighting technologies when possible and identify technological challenges with such.  
- The following airfield lighting scenarios, should address:
         - Stand-alone vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) site.
         - Intermediate (24-72 hour) VFR and limited IFR capable runway.
         - Sustained (semi-permanent) non-precision IFR capable runway.
         - Sustained (semi-permanent) CAT I IFR capable runway
- Reduce the overall energy use of the lighting system where feasible in an expeditionary environment. 
- All aspects of the system must be fully compatible with Night Vision Devices.

The following are notional logistics requirements:
-  Capacity to perform or partnership that allows:
        - Integrated Logistics Support, specifically supply support
        - Experience with DoD for technical data
        - Obsolescence management

Future capabilities that will be studied are: heat management in order to support MV-22 and F-35B operations. 

Companies interested in participating in the SLS program are asked to respond to this RFI with a brief summary of their knowledge, capabilities and experience in the areas of: (1) Lighting (airfield) design, development, and testing; (2) DoD processes for acquisition of integrated systems; (3) lighting control systems and technology; (4) Expeditionary requirements; (5) modeling and simulation, and networks, including in testing; (6) control systems and instrumentation in harsh environments; (7) health diagnostic information systems; and (8) experience with software development and company CMMI certification. Respondents to this RFI should provide programmatic, technical and experience information on their ability to potentially design, develop, install and support an SLS for US Marine Corps Expeditionary Airfields. The SLS can be systems that are currently available as a commercial or non-developmental item that meets the requirements in this RFI, or systems and/or products in development that will meet the requirements stated in the RFI.<br />NAVAIR would also like to gain insight from industry (primes and vendors) on several key areas to assist in SLS planning. Interested companies are encouraged to: 
A) Provide estimated Source Lines of Code (including new, reused, and modified) for software based on similar efforts and feedback on SLS system requirements.
B) Provide feedback on alternative energy challenges, including but not limited to: airfield integration and scalability requirements.
C) Provide the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the solutions solicited in this RFI.
D) If the contractor can provide the entire capacity of SLS. If not, the contractor should identify what aspects of the requirement they would be capable of supporting. 
E) Provide business size to identify if small business sources exist. Specifically, small business size status (i.e. Small Business, Hubzone, 8(a), SDVOSB, etc)

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a solicitation, or an indication that the PMA-251 Program Office or NAVAIR will contract for the items contained in the RFI. NAVAIR will not pay respondents for any information generated for or provided in response to this RFI. The Government will not reimburse the respondent for any costs associated with the information submitted in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. The Government will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI, to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside of the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend. Submit your response in a Microsoft&reg; Word or compatible format document in no more than twenty single-sided, single-spaced pages, 12-point, Times New Roman font, using a minimum of one-inch margins.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">We have seen many technology solutions that can cost effectively address Phase One and Two of the information sharing project. We have also seen evidence that the objectives of Phase Three may be addressed by the same single technology solution being used to satisfactorily address Phase One and Two. It would be highly desired to able to address all agency information sharing needs within a single technology solution. However, our initial focus and commitment is on Phases One and Two of the project.<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">After initial research, our efforts have focused on open source solutions including Plone, Drupal, and a Drupal/Alfresco integration. Other open source solutions and value priced commercial products may be proposed. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">A recommended solution should meet the functionality needs and include data supported evidence concerning market-share/viability of the product in general. In particular, the recommended solution should have a track record of adoption and implementation within federal government agencies. As a small agency, we are looking for an out-of-the-box solution that will require minimal customization, leveraging what is being done in larger federal agencies for our own use on our site.</span></p>

<SOLNBR>N0017412SN005
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:omar.roque@navy.mil">Omar Roque</a>
<DESC>***This special notice is a modification to N0017412SN003 and 12SN004. This modification extends the submission due date from 30 Nov 2011 to 7 Dec 2011 and answer questions that were submitted via email.***

This notice is issued by the Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 requires the Government to conduct market research before developing new requirements documents for an acquisition. Results of market research are used to determine whether qualified sources exist and whether commercial items are available to meet the requirement.

One of the ways the Government conducts market research is to issue a Request for Information (RFI).
 A RFI provides a broad statement of need, briefly describes the Governmentâ€™s intention regarding program/acquisition approach, and identifies key events in the acquisition program schedule. 

Description:

This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes, as part of a market survey on services for Dismounted Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronics Warfare (CREW) system. This particular system is intended to be worn by an individual, and provide protection to only that individual. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION FOR BID NOTICE. The document is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to identify potential solutions for individual dismounted CREW hardware.
 NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.
Requirements have been identified for a CREW capability that provides a small zone of protection for an individual troop. Threshold and objective level performance parameters have been identified. Although it is desired that the initial fielded capability meets objective level requirements, the system must meet threshold performance parameters and be ready for fielding in 2Q of CY12. Based on performance and capabilities of the initial fielded hardware, an improved capability may be developed for fielding in 2Q CY13 that fully meets objective performance parameters. The Government has a desire to assess the capabilities of any hardware that has potential to meet the requirements.
 In order to meet the requested fielding timeline, prototype hardware must be available to the government no later than the end of January 2012. Threshold and objective performance requirements can be provided separately at a classified level. It is requested that white papers be submitted that fully describe system capabilities with respect to the classified performance levels in as much detail as possible. Based on the submissions, the Government may elect to conduct one-on-one discussions with Industry based on its analysis of the RFI responses, the quality of submission, and the level and scope of the information provided. This may include visits to contractorâ€™s facilities to assess firsthand the validity of described capabilities.
 A laboratory demonstration at the contractor facility may also be requested. Those capabilities or systems that show promise may be selected for additional testing at Government locations. The additional testing will be pursued outside of this RFI. Test results from closed loop or range testing will be releasable to a variety of DoD activities. 

Response Format:

Interested parties who believe they are capable of filling this requirement are invited to indicate their interest by providing a white paper; (a) company name, company address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), cage code, point of contact, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number; and (b) business size and unique qualifiers (e.g.
 large, foreign, small disadvantaged, veteran owned, woman owned, etc.)

Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI in Microsoft Word for Office 2007 â€“ compatible format. RFI responses are limited to 15 pages, including cover and administrative pages. Response documents shall be written using a 10 point font size or larger.

The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as confidential under this statute. Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any proprietary (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:

1.
 Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) proprietary with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.

2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as proprietary may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 3 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.

3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain.
 Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Governments rights in the data.

4. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the proprietary legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends proprietary portion begins: and proprietary portion ends.

Response Deadline and Submissions:

Parties may begin submitting responses to this request for information immediately. Submissions are due by 1600 hours Eastern Time on 7 Dec 2011.
 Responses shall be sent via email to: Omar Roque at omar.roque@navy.mil.

Note the Government is under no obligation to conduct these sessions, nor is it liable for any costs or expenses incurred in replying to this RFI. The information provided in response to this RFI will be used to support on-going initiatives within DoD to analyze emerging requirements for dismounted CREW systems and ultimately may result in the Government developing and issuing a RFP for respondents

QUESTION 1: Can you tell me if these efforts are currently being performed by a contractor? If so, could you please provide the Incumbent name as well as the contract number?

Answer: There is no incumbent contractor for this requirement.

QUESTION 2: How do we obtain a copy of the classified information

Answer: Please submit requests to Omar Roque at omar.roque@navy.mil

QUESTION 3: If our proposal contains classified information, how should we submit that portion of the proposal?

Answer: Please email Omar Roque for delivery instructions.

<DESC>The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission intends to perform a non-competitive contract modification to increase the value of the contract NRC-HQ-11-P-04-0067. The original sole source solicitation number was RES-11-096 and posted 2/23/2011. This firm fixed priced contract was awarded to Dycoda LLC for the work entitled "MELCOR Analysis of ISLOCA for Surry Plant. The increase in the level of effort of 150 hours and the extension to the period of performance is 8 months. The current value of the contract is $73,712.60. The estimated cost of this additional work is $29,708.37, which will bring the contract value to $103,420.97.<br />The contract was initially awarded as a sole source, under FAR 6.302-1 (b)(1), which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the services are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy NRC's requirements. The justification for the sole source award was that Dycoda was the only commercially available source that could uniquely perform: <br />- Re-running the Surry ISLOCA scenario to account for new plant configuration information received from the Surry Plant.<br />- Finalizing the already-started MELCOR analysis for the Surry Plant for SOARCA.<br />- Working to address SOARCA Peer Review Committee comments on SOARCA for Surry.<br />- Working to address NRC comments on SOARCA for Surry.<br />- Presenting work completed for this project at public forums.<br />Since the proposed modification is an extension of the current work performed, Dycoda is considered the only responsible source to perform the work under this modification.<br />This notice of intent is neither a request for quotation nor a solicitation of offers. Interested respondents must submit a written capability statement, including information sufficient to demonstrate a bona fide written capability to meet this requirement, to the point of contact of this posting no later than 10 calendar days from the date announcement appears in the Federal Business Opportunities. Telephonic, email and responses providing insufficient information for evaluation by the NRC will not be considered. If no response is received within 10 calendar days award of the contract modification will be made to Dycoda LLC.<br />

<DESC>Notice of intent to award a firm fixed price sole source contract to LGS Innovations LLC, the original equipment manufacturer, is tasked to provide extended software warranty for maintenance support coverage of the JHITS swtiching network to include "bug" fixes for customer found Severity Level 1 and 2 problems requiring software code changes for customer unique requirements. LGS Innvoations LLC is the only supplier that can provide the required software warranty support for the updates to the JHITS 5ESS switches, as the software updates will require certification by JITC for information assurance and interoperability compliance. No other vendor is licensed to provide maintenance support and sofware updates for the 5ESS switching network that meets JITC compliance.
<p>Without the extended software maintenance coverage, the JHITS 5ESS switch software will lapse and maintenance services will not be available causing significant risks affecting operational conditions that could lead to failures and network outages. This would negatively impact telephony connectivity throughout the Pacific, to include global DSN connectivity. The 5ESS extended software warranty is critical to prevent isolation of various military installations throughout Hawaii as well as the global networks supporting the Pacific Warfighter.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for Expressions of Interest (EOI), proposals or quotations. No solicitation document exists and no telephone inquiries will be accepted.</p>
<p>This purchase will be under Acquisition of Commercial Items, FAR Part 12; Simplified Acquisition Procedures, FAR Part 13; and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized under FAR 6.302-1. Point of contact for this procurement is Jayme Nagao, email address jayme.nagao@disa.mil.</p>

<DESC><p>A. INTRODUCTION: Tactical Network Testbed (TNT) Collaboration</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.<br /><br />The purpose of this RFI is to solicit technology experimentation candidates from Research and Development (R&amp;D) organizations, private industry, and academia for inclusion in future experimentation events coordinated by the U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). USSOCOM invites industry, academia, individuals and Government labs to submit technology experimentation papers addressing innovative technologies leading to possible Government/Industry collaboration for development of USSOCOM technology capabilities. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighter.</p>
<p>SOF experimentation focus areas for FY12 will explore emerging technologies, technical applications, and their potential to provide solutions with an understanding in concepts, operations and future SOF capabilities. SOF experimentation focus areas have been assigned for each of the four quarterly TNT events scheduled in FY12 as follows:</p>
<p>- November 2011: Small Team Force Protection; Communications; Power and Water Generation.<br /><br />- February 2012: Mission Planning, Modeling, Simulation, and Training; Combat Weather; Military Information Support Operation (MISO) and Civil Affairs (CA)<br /><br />- May 2012: Warrior Systems; Small Team Weapons <br /><br />- August 2012: Mobility and Vehicle Protection</p>
<p>Additional RFIs will be released to FedBizOpps approximately 60 days prior to each scheduled TNT event to provide additional details.</p>
<p>After review of the technology experimentation paper submissions, the Government may invite select candidates to experiment their technologies at the USSOCOM &amp; NPS sponsored TNT experimentation event. The TNT venue will provide an opportunity for the submitter to interact with USSOCOM personnel for the purpose of USSOCOM assessing potential impact of emerging technology solutions on USSOCOM missions and capabilities. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighter. Industry participation in experimentation activities does not suggest or imply that USSOCOM or NPS will procure or purchase equipment.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVE:<br /><br />1. Background: USSOCOM conducts quarterly TNT experimentation events in cooperation with NPS at Camp Roberts, CA (three per year) and at Avon Park, FL (one per year). These cooperative TNT experiments are conducted with representatives from Government R&amp;D organizations, academia, and private industry. TNT experimentation events provide an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel to determine how their technology development efforts and ideas may support or enhance SOF capability needs. The environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between Government, academia, and industry to promote the identification and assessment of emerging and mature technologies for the primary goal of accelerating the delivery of technology discoveries to the SOF warfighter.</p>
<p>Mission-Based Experimentation (MBE) provides remedied solutions to identified high priority, high value SOF mission deficiencies allowing evolution and adaptation in the field to quickly help identify solutions designed to mission objectives. The Government's intent is to take selected respondent technology into unimproved expeditionary-like conditions for up to three (3) days and return the submitted technology to respondent upon completion of exercise. All respondents will be required to complete a vendor loan agreement (see attachment) to participate in the MBE. Materiel solutions should be at a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 or greater for the purpose of MBE.<br /><br />Capability-Based Experimentation (CBE) provides an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel and determine how their efforts might support special operations capabilities in a discovery learning environment. A discovery learning environment includes interaction and collaboration between industry, government labs, academia and other government interests. CBE identifies potential technology solutions, impacts, limitations, and utility to meet SOF technical objectives and thrust areas. Materiel solutions should be at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or greater for the purpose of CBE. CBE experiments will be between a half day and five days in duration and be conducted in unimproved expeditionary-like conditions.</p>
<p>2. Experimentation Focus: Experiments will be conducted from 7-17 February 2012, at Avon Park, FL. The venue will explore emerging technology solutions for: Mission Planning, Modeling, Simulation, and Training; Combat Weather; Military Information Support Operation (MISO) and Civil Affairs (CA). Technology will need to be capable of supporting a SOF team up to 18 members to provide an increased security, enhanced situational awareness, and increased mission effectiveness.<br /><br />(a) MBE 12-2: 07-11 February 2012 at Avon Park, FL. Focus: MBE 12-2 will focus on Mission Planning, Training, Military Information Support Operation (MISO) and Civil Affairs (CA). Technology should be at Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL-6) or greater for the purpose of MBE. Any and all solutions must provide all necessary software and hardware to accomplish the mission. A SOF three to six member team will be at an unimproved remote village site and must be able to operate independent of other sustainment bases and facilities. Mission planning may include simulation, virtual interview training, modeling, and virtual sand table mission rehearsals. MISO and CA capabilities may include: Human terrain mapping, civil and social terrain mapping, information, production and dissemination technologies. Systems with attributes resulting in simplifications to existing tasks, procedures, and/or equipment operation and improvement in training, emplacement, and/or operation are desired. Additional MISO and CA measures considered would be systems that interpret MISO and CA situations along with analytical software for predictive analysis of possible SOF solutions to MISO and CA situations. <br /><br />(b) CBE 12-2 12-17 February 2012 at Avon Park, FL. Focus: CBE 12-2 will focus on Mission Planning, Modeling, Simulation, and Weather on Target. Experiments will be conducted to explore the application of emerging technology solutions for Mission Planning, Modeling, Simulation, and Weather on Target, both current and forecast. Technology should be at Technology Readiness Level 3 (TRL-3) or greater for the purpose of CBE. <br /><br />3. Security Requirements: Vendors should not submit classified information in the technology experimentation papers.<br /><br />4. Other Special Requirements: DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS. SUBMIT TECHNOLOGY EXPERIMENTATION PAPERS ONLY. EXPERIMENTATION PAPER SUBMITTALS WILL ONLY BE ACCEPTED WITHIN A 30 DAY SUBMISSION PERIOD DEFINED AS 60-30 DAYS PRIOR TO EACH SPECIFIED TNT EVENT. For the February TNT at Avon Park, FL., all submissions must be received no later than 23 December 2011. No contracts will be awarded based solely on this announcement or any subsequent supplemental RFI announcements planned for the June and August 2012 TNT events.</p>

<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE:  The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Construction and Facilities Management, intends to award a contract to San Diego  Project Management, PSC, Luquillo, PR, as a non-competitive Sole Source Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned (SDVOSB) to install, rent, and maintain a temporary electrical substation for Phase 2 OPA (Outpatient Addition) at the VA Caribbean Healthcare System, San Juan, Puerto Rico. This procurement is a Sole Source SDVOSB noncompetitive procurement.

Phase 2 Outpatient Addition (OPA) Project includes a main electrical connection to a Medical Center electrical substation in order to energize all electrical equipment that will be installed under this project. The Medical Center electrical substation upgrade is currently being constructed by a San Juan Medical Center NRM Project (672-08-101). This project is significantly behind schedule and will not be completed on time for the new connection of Phase 2 OPA Project. 

This situation will substantially impact the critical path of the project to the point that it may be necessary to issue a Stop Work Order.  In order to avoid this imminent impact the VA concurred that the best solution at this point is to install a temporary electrical substation. 

We have discussed different contracting alternatives to award this contract and we believe that the best solution is to award a sole source contract to the SDVOSB that currently is working with the San Juan Medical Center NRM Project.

The name of the company is San Diego Project Management PSC.  We believe that this new procurement action will be more advantageous and cost effective to the Government that if this contractor performs this work for the following reasons:

a.	Contractor is already mobilized in the vicinity of the construction area. The project impact to the San Juan Medical Center will be significantly reduced since the contractor can use the same lay down area that he is currently is using for other contracts. As of now, the assignment of new contractor staging areas is very limited due to space constraints within the San Juan Medical Center. This will also decrease the overhead costs.

b.	Contractor has gone through the VA submittal process and is also familiar with all other submittals required by the contract specifications saving time in the completion of the project. They are also familiar with all the PR Local permits requirements.

c.	We can utilize the PR Electrical Power Authority permit process already performed by this contractor; this is a savings of approx 6 months.

d.	Contractor already has the knowledge of the site utility conditions involved that will reduce considerably the pre-construction efforts and demolition associated costs and time. They have already mobilized and have staff on site.

e.	San Diego project Management, PSC, is a VIP database registered and verified SDVOSB and has been determined to be a responsible contractor with the experience and capability to complete the work in the allotted time. Contractor is registered in the CCR.

Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: VAAR 819.7007, FAR 6.303-2, and 38 U.S.C. Â§ 8127(c).

The work is located at VA Caribbean Healthcare System, San Juan, PR. The Offeror shall furnish, and obtain any and all necessary licenses and/or permits required to perform this work in Puerto Rico. The magnitude of this project is between $250,000 and $500,000. The NAICS Code for this work is 238210. To be considered a small business under this code the SBA size standard must not exceed $14.0 M.

DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks have, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>The award decision is based on evaluation factors that are tailored to the acquisition. Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PRICE. FACTOR #2: SCHEDULE. FACTOR 3: QUALITY OF PRODUCT.<BR><BR>

<p>5. Conduct in-depth and daily liaison with the Peruvian Ministry of Transportation and Communications, Coast Guard, Counterdrug Police, Customs, and Port Authorities as well as US interagency organizations involved with CN and Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Complexity:<br />1. Assignments include analysis and direction of all facets of a sophisticated Ports program using container scanners, mobile and fixed x-ray systems, complex research-investigative link analysis, and information management system, within an integrated program of diverse counter-narcotics operations and training.

Must be able to independently perform fieldwork in remote areas for extended periods without assistance.</p>
<p>Work Environment:<br />The work is primarily conducted in an office or cargo inspection site with travel to the field for meetings, conferences, activity reviews, and field inspections and or evaluations. Occasionally, some travel will be required into areas declared hazardous duty locations by DOS due to hostile activities of the drug-traffickers and therefore pose significant risk to the advisor while at these sites.

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals.

In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-88 GUARANTEES (APR 2010) <br />(a) In the event any work performed or materials furnished by the contractor under this contract prove defective or deficient within 90 days from the date of redelivery of the vessel, the contractor, as directed by the Contracting Officer and at its own expense, shall correct and repair the deficiency to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.<br />(b) The Government shall be entitled to rely upon any guarantee secured by the contractor or any sub-contractor covering work done or materials furnished which exceeds the 90-day period until its expiration. <br />(c) With respect to any individual work item identified and listed as incomplete at the redelivery of the vessel, the guarantee period shall run from the date of completion of such item. <br />(d) If and when practicable, the Government shall afford the contractor an opportunity to effect such corrections and repairs.<br />(1) If the Contracting Officer determines it is impracticable or is otherwise not advisable to return the vessel to the contractor, or the contractor fails to proceed promptly with any such repairs as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may direct that the repairs be performed elsewhere, at the contractor's expense.<br />(2) Where corrections and repairs are to be made by other than the contractor due to nonreturn of the vessel to the contractor, the contractor's liability may be discharged by an equitable deduction in the price of the contract.<br />(e) The contractor's liability shall only extend for an additional 90-day guarantee period on those defects or deficiencies which it corrected. However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(f) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable reduction shall constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract. If a defect or deficiency that exists at the time of redelivery of the vessel was not discovered by a reasonable inspection and is discovered after the expiration of the time frame stated in this clause, it is not subject to the time limitations stated in this clause.<br />(End of clause)<br />1352.271-90 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS (APR 2010)<br />(a) The contractor shall procure and thereafter maintain the following insurance:<br />(1) Ship contractor's legal liability insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (b) of clause 1352.271-79.

Such certificates shall be furnished prior to commencement of the work. Each certificate shall state that (To be competed at time of award) has insured (To be competed at time of award) awarded contract number (To be competed at time of award) for repair/alteration of NOAA Ship HENRY BIGELOW in accordance with the Liability and Insurance clause and the Insurance Requirements clause contained herein.

<p>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NCND6021-11-01038DT.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-53.</p>
<p>(IV) This solicitation is being issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The associated NAICS code is 339950. The small business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial item(s)/services:<br />CLIN 0001 Provide design, fabrication and installation of 10 outdoor digital high pressure laminate (DHPL) interpretive signs measuring 36 inch wide by 24 inch tall and &frac12; inch thick for the Torch Oil/Platform Irene Oil Spill Natural Resources Trustee Council Rocky Intertidal Habitat Protection Program. The outdoor signs shall be installed at outdoor settings at entrances to rocky intertidal beaches in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties. The remaining five signs and bases/mounting hardware are to be delivered to a location in Santa Barbara County.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:<br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br />Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary<br />Rocky Intertidal Interpretive Signs and Graphic Panel Design and Fabrication</p>
<p>Contractor Responsibility<br />The contractor is responsible for design and fabrication of ten (10) outdoor interpretive signs. The signs will be 36" wide by 24" tall and &frac12; inch thick with rounded corners and fabricated from digital high pressure laminate (DHPL) material and shall have a 10 year warranty.</p>
<p>Five of the ten signs will be fully installed by June 30, 2012 in outdoor settings at entrances to rocky intertidal beaches in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties (approximate coordinates below). The remaining five signs and bases/mounting hardware are to be delivered to a location in Santa Barbara County.</p>
<p>Background<br />The Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary is leading the implementation of the Torch Oil/Platform Irene Oil Spill Natural Resources Trustee Council Rocky Intertidal Habitat Protection Program ("program"). The goals of the program are to provide local community outreach and education regarding the sensitivities of rocky intertidal habitats and to reduce the impacts from human disturbance on tide pools. Tide pools and other components of rocky intertidal shores represent a species-rich habitat which attracts a wide array of visitors and collectors. Human disturbance of tide pool areas is of concern and includes trampling of the resources, turnover of rocks, displacement of both living and non-living resources, and collecting of intertidal species or shells that can provide habitat. In addition to direct losses from trampling and collecting, secondary changes may result from changes in distribution, prey availability and competition. Under heavy use, patches of habitat become more frequently disturbed, allowing less time for recovery. <br />Program components include the design, fabrication and installation of interpretive signage and exhibit panels about rocky intertidal habitats. The interpretive signs will be located at various public locations such as overlooks, beaches and other popular ocean-view sites that are managed by federal, state or private partners. The interpretive signs will provide information to the public about natural history information about black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii) and their adaptations to surviving in the rocky intertidal zone. They also will interpret the importance of protecting black abalone, current research underway to understand threats to their survival and ocean etiquette techniques to minimize impacts to remaining populations. The primary audience will be the Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo County communities and visitors to the area's beaches. <br />Objectives<br />The contractor will be responsible for working with staff from the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and the Torch Oil Spill Rocky Intertidal Education Outreach Project Coordinator ("CINMS staff and Project Coordinator") to coordinate, design and fabricate interpretive signage, and to install signage in five (5) locations that are managed by a number of state, county and local partners.<br />The contractor will develop a systematic approach to rocky intertidal interpretive signage and use a list of common themes and messages. Each sign will have a common look and feel, yet it will need to be adaptable to the needs of the partners. Interactions with partners will be unified and baseline standards will be used.</p>
<p>Statement of Work<br />1. Development of a timeline for signage development, review, fabrication and installation. The contractor will deliver a timeline for the development, fabrication and installation of interpretive signs. Ten (10) signs are to be fabricated of which five (5) are to be installed and five (5) are to be delivered by June 30, 2012.</p>
<p>2. Development of sign content and design. The contractor shall work closely with CINMS staff and Project Coordinator to develop the sign content and overall design, utilizing provided text and photos. The contractor shall conduct regular meetings (in person and /or by phone &amp; email) between the project staff and any partners involved in this project as needed. The contractor shall be responsible for developing a design that incorporates the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries graphic standards and the standards required by the partners involved. The signs may differ by location depending on logos and standards of regional partners, but overall content (graphics/text) will remain the same. There will be an initial submittal of the text and photos by NOAA, a draft design returned to NOAA and then up to two cycles of review.<br /><br />3. Fabrication of signage. Ten (10) signs with the dimensions of 36" wide by 24" tall will be made from DHPL, &frac12; inch in thickness, with rounded edges. Eight (8) bases will be powder coated aluminum double leg low profile models with backing panel (KVO Slimline or similar). These bases will include 2 posts and a backing panel for each sign. Two (2) of the signs will be rail mounted and will require appropriate mounting hardware.</p>
<p>4. Exhibit installation/set-up. Subsequent to the fabrication of the signs, the contractor shall work with CINMS staff, Project Coordinator and partners to install five (5) signs. Three (3) of the signs are to be installed on double leg base mounts, with two (2) signs installed with rail mounts. The approximate locations include:</p>
<p>Location; # of Signs; Mount; Coordinates; County<br /><br />Coal Oil Point 1 double leg base bolted to panel 34 24' 26.00 N 119 52' 42.06 W Santa Barbara <br />Jalama Beach 1 double leg base bolted to panel 34 30' 40.06 N 120 30' 6.50 W Santa Barbara <br />Boathouse 1 double leg base bolted to panel 34 33' 17.06 N 120 36' 38.03 W Santa Barbara <br />Shell Beach 1 Rail mount 35 09' 55.03 N 120 41' 31.18 W San Luis Obispo<br />Shell Beach 1 Rail mount 35 10' 8.50" N 120 41' 46.35" W San Luis Obispo</p>
<p>5. Deliverables. All final graphics files for signs and graphics must be furnished to the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary upon the completion of the project.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

<p>15. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<CONTACT>Sherrie N. Randall, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882866, Fax 7704882868, Email iom2@cdc.gov - Julio E Lopez, Lead Contract Specialist, Phone 770-488-2892, Fax 770-488-2868, Email ftg4@cdc.gov
<DESC><br />This is a sources sought announcement to determine the availability of potential vendors (including, but not limited to, small business (e.g. 8 (a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantage business, and women-owned small business) that can provide support to the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention to provide economic evaluation, cost effective analyses, and technical assistance for HIV Care and Prevention Strategies.<br /><br /><strong>Background:</strong>
<p><br />As a part of its overall public health mission, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides leadership in helping control the HIV epidemic by working with community, state, national, and international partners in surveillance, research, and prevention and evaluation activities. In July, 2010, President Barack Obama unveiled the first National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) for the United States. To accomplish one of its three key goals, Reduce New HIV Infections, the Strategy calls for ensuring that prevention resources be more strategically concentrated in specific communities at high risk for HIV infection; allocating public funding to geographic areas consistent with the epidemic; and designing, evaluating, and implementing innovative prevention strategies and combination approaches for preventing HIV in high-risk communities.</p>
<p>In direct support of NHAS, the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP), a unit of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP), funded a three-year, high impact prevention demonstration project to facilitate the development and implementation of Enhanced Comprehensive HIV Prevention Plans (ECHPPs) in 12 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) most affected by the HIV epidemic. As the grantees were encouraged to prioritize their intervention plans based on strong scientific evidence, DHAP began a systematic review of published cost-effectiveness analyses of HIV prevention interventions. What became clear from the results of this effort was that gaps exist in the literature on the cost-effectiveness of evidence-based HIV prevention interventions. Few, or no, published analyses were found for 7 of the 14 required interventions. Since the ECHPP approach is now the basis of the larger $359 million Health Department Prevention Funding Announcement for all areas, the dearth of costing data and other modeling literature is even more critical. Economic evaluations of HIV prevention and care interventions provide stakeholders with tools to set priorities for high-risk populations, and to quantify and communicate the impact of priority setting.</p>
<p>DHAP requires the support of an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract to acquire support in the following areas: 1) economic evaluation including cost-effectiveness analyses of single and combination HIV prevention interventions; 2) literature reviews and summaries of cost and cost-effectiveness analyses of HIV prevention strategies; 3) modeling of optimal HIV prevention funding allocations among populations and programs; 4) quantitative policy analyses of HIV prevention policies, guidelines, and practices; 5) technical assistance for CDC to provide state and local health departments assistance to optimize their HIV prevention portfolios; and 6) other HIV prevention cost data collection and analyses, as required.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to provide the CDC with rapid turnaround to obtain required services related to high impact public health activities in priority areas related to cost-effectiveness to help guide the most efficient use of HIV prevention funds. These services could include, but are not limited to:<br />-&nbsp;Conducting cost-effectiveness analyses focused on newly emerging single interventions;<br />-&nbsp;Conducting comparative cost-effectiveness analyses of the impact of multiple interventions as <br />delivered to specific populations;<br />-&nbsp;Examining resource allocation models to identify and understand the underlying commonalities, <br />assumptions, and model structures among cost-effective resource models and to identify complex approaches for optimizing the impact of HIV care and prevention at the national and local levels;<br />-&nbsp;Conducting high level analyses that look at potential policy changes and their cost-effectiveness <br />at the national level;<br />-Conducting literature searches, collection of costing data in the field, and review of existing <br />costing data at CDC and elsewhere;<br />-Providing technical assistance and capacity building mechanisms to CDC in order improve state <br />and local health departments utilization of appropriate models and optimize their HIV <br />prevention portfolios.</p>
<p>These efforts may also involve time and motion studies, policy assessments, epidemic modeling, consultations and workshops, and related support as detailed in each request for Task Order proposal issued.</p>
<p><strong>Capability Statement: <br /></strong><br />Vendors who believe they have the ability to&nbsp;provide support in the areas listed in the Background Section and the Purpose and Objectives section,&nbsp;are encouraged to submit a capability statement. The capability statements will be evaluated based on the information provided and current in-house capacity to perform the work including: (a) staff availability, experience, and training; (b) prior completed projects of a similar nature; and (c) examples of prior completed contracts, dollar value of the contracts, references, and other related information.</p>
<p>Capability statements shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone/fax/email, and business size and status (e.g. small business, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantage business, and women owned small business). The remainder of the capability statement should be tailored to the information outlined in this Sources Sought Announcement and must demonstrate that similar work has been performed in the past.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis notice is amended to include the following information:&nbsp;
<p>DLA Aviation policy requires all business visitors to register with security prior to coming onto the base. If you choose to hand deliver your proposal, we will need to know the day and approximate time you will be coming at least one business day in advance so we can enter you into the visitor system and provide you with a point of contact in the bid room who will meet you, receive your package and provide a receipt (if requested by the offeror). All requests concerning dropping off the LCLV<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>proposal in person should be sent to Kim.Licence@dla.mil.</p>
<p>Please note, couriers and contractor personnel will not be permitted to meet with members of the government's contracting team while dropping off their proposal.</p>
<p>Offers failing to return a proposal by the time specified in SPM4A7-12-R-1069 shall be rejected as non-responsive. Any delays incurred at the DLA Aviation Visitor Center shall not constitute a basis for solicitation re-opening and therefore, an offeror who chooses to hand deliver proposals shall plan accordingly.</p>

<DESC>Q1. "Is this project for a Category-I Airfield, or for an airfield that will deploy VFR/VMC and Non-Precision IFR/IMC operations?"
<p>A1. NAVAIR is seeking to a system capability to accommodate operations under CAT-I Precision IFR conditions but is also capable of being scaled down to accommodate non-Precision IFR or VFR operations when appropriate.</p>
<p><br />Q2. "Is Semi/Permanent Runway Centerline Lights (RCL) required by this contract?"</p>
<p>A2. Specific airfield lighting components have not been identified at this time."</p>
<p><br />Q3. "Is near IR LED capability for NVGs mandatory for this project?"</p>
<p>A3. Specific component performance parameters have not been identified at this time. Future requests for information may contain Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) for individual components.</p>
<p><br />Q4. "... would your program office allow our Bidding Team to source that from a third-party OEM ... or you would frown on multi-tier Bidding Teams that include several OEM Sub-Contractors contributing the various pieces? For example, would it be acceptable to phase the deployment such that Solid State Lighting would be deployed immediately, and then later the Solar-powered LED (NVG-integrated) lighting would deployed?"</p>
<p>A4. The use of an appropriate sub-component third-party OEM is acceptable to achieve the desired KPPs once determined. As stated in the RFI, the acquisition strategy has not yet been finalized; therefore, discussion of a phased deployment schedule cannot take place at this time.</p>
<p>Q5. What range of system size is desirable - what size aircraft needs to be accommodated?</p>
<p>A5. Although Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) have not yet been defined, SLS must be capable of supporting all types and models of US Marine Corps aircraft, and other US forces and allied aircraft that support USMC operations.</p>
<p>Q6. Are you looking at runway lighting only, or are you considering apron and other lighting?</p>
<p>A6. Taxiway edge lighting is desired as part of SLS. Specific KPPs have not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Q7. How portable does the system need to be? Are there time restrictions for set up and removal?</p>
<p>A7. Although it is envisioned that different elements of the SLS may have individual packaging, embarkation, set-up and removal requirements; specific KPPs have not been determined at this time.</p>
<p><br />Q8. The solicitation calls for potential support functions. What type of support is envisioned - technical, operational or both?</p>
<p>A8. Respondents to this RFI should state all levels of support - including, but not limited to: technical (design, follow-on troubleshooting), logistics (technical documentation, training, supply support), and programmatic (component integrations) - that they are capable of performing. It is not required that each interested party be capable of performing every support function necessary to develop, produce and sustain SLS.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Request for Information (RFI) for<br />European Telecommunications Requirement</strong></p>
<p><strong>Contracting Office Address:<br /></strong>Defense Information Systems Agency, DITCO-Scott PL8223, 2300 East Drive, Bldg 3600, Scott AFB, IL, 62225-5406</p>
<p><strong>1. The following provision applies to this Request for Information (RFI).<br /></strong>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997)<br />(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.<br />(b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.<br />(c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of conducting Market Research which will be used in the development of the Acquisition Strategy and Performance Work Statement (PWS) for the European Telecommunications Requirement.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The FAR is available on the World Wide Web and can be found at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil or http://www.arnet.gov.far/</p>
<p><strong>3. Description.<br /></strong>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal or a promise to issue a Request for Proposal in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>All businesses (large and small) are requested to respond to this RFI to assist the Government in formulating an acquisition strategy that fairly considers the ability of all businesses to participate in the acquisition, either as prime contractors or as subcontractors. Businesses are also requested to advise of the availability of any existing GSA Schedules or Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) that could be considered to fulfill this requirement.</p>
<p>Responses should include descriptions of recent (within the past three years or work that is on-going) and relevant experience (work similar in type and scope) to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact with telephone numbers where the responder performed the relevant work. Marketing brochures and/or generic company literature will not be considered. Not addressing all the requested information may result in the Government determining the responder is not capable of performing the scope of work required.</p>
<p><strong>4. Requested Information:<br /></strong>Interested vendors are requested to submit a statement of their knowledge and capabilities to perform the following:<br /><br />The purpose of this requirement is to obtain worldwide wireless services and hardware for Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM/GPRS) telephone services (approximately 15k devices), wireless Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs)/Smartphone e.g. Apple, Android, and other new technology systems as they emerge, hardware and services, other wireless and data services, and international indirect dial services ("99 access to DSN, approximately 40k numbers) for all Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) activities within the Europe footprint, which may include the US European Command (USEUCOM), US Central Command (USCENTCOM), and US African Command (USAFRICOM) areas of responsibilities (AORs).</p>
<p>The Government currently has two contracts in place that are expiring. The Government's intent is to combine them into one contract, plus add the ability to use new technology data devices such as iPhone, Android, tablet devices (iPad), etc. One contract is GSA's FTS2001 contract for commercial access International Dial (IID) Service within the European area of operations using 5th Signal Command's existing local circuits. The FTS2001 contract provides for the ability to dial commercially from the DSN telephone network. Presently, 5th Signal Command's existing local circuits which provide connectivity to the PSTN are PRI (Primary Rate Interface) based. However, Army 5th Signal and other DoD entities are interested in understanding what IP-based connectivity options may be available either at present or in the future from telecommunications carriers. Therefore, as part of the response to this RFI, respondents should assume that all near term connectivity will PRI-based but provided items detailing IP-based access options for informational purposes. Migration from PRI based connectivity to IP based connectivity is viewed as a long term goal. The second contract is with Vodafone to provide wireless hardware and services primarily to include wireless voice and data services for cellular phones and Blackberries. Wireless (cell phone, Blackberry, smart phone) needs include hardware and service for voice and data, Universal Mobile Telecommunications (UMTS) for data type services and international roaming. It is the Government's intent to combine both expiring contracts into one new contract in order to provide a business solution, for IID and wireless/data services that will increase efficiency of service though one service provider, consolidating technologies and systems, and leveraging a business solution to provide better service at a lower cost. It is the Government's intent to be able to add new technologies during the life of the new contract. Any additions, changes, or upgrades that incur additional costs to the new contract must be jointly agreed upon between the contractor and the Government, and approved by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. A draft PWS is included with this notice. Interested parties are requested to review the PWS and provide their comments as part of their response to this RFI. The PWS includes three attachments:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Attachment 1 - Call Data Volume and Utilization<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Attachment 2 - 5th Signal Corps Telephone System Hardware Infrastructure Outline<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Attachment 3 - Example Comma Separate Values (CSV) File.</p>
<p>Comments on the PWS or PWS attachments are to be provided in the format provided as Attachment 4 - PWS Comment Format. Comments will be reviewed for incorporation into future documents that might be developed as a result of this RFI. There will be no posting of all comments received from this review of the PWS.

<DESC>This is to address the issues contractors may have accessing the ASFI site when trying to download the solicitation package.

<DESC>A. INTRODUCTION: Tactical Network Testbed (TNT) Collaboration <br />This Request for Information (RFI) is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.<br /><br />The purpose of this RFI is to solicit technology experimentation candidates from Research and Development (R&amp;D) organizations, private industry, and academia for inclusion in future experimentation events coordinated by the U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). USSOCOM invites industry, academia, individuals and Government labs to submit technology experimentation papers addressing innovative technologies leading to possible Government/Industry collaboration for development of USSOCOM technology capabilities. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighter.
<p>SOF experimentation focus areas for FY12 will explore emerging technologies, technical applications, and their potential to provide solutions with an understanding in concepts, operations and future SOF capabilities. SOF experimentation focus areas have been assigned for each of the four quarterly TNT events scheduled in FY12 as follows:<br /><br />- November 2011: Small Team Force Protection; Communications; Power and Water Generation.<br /><br />- February 2012: Mission Planning, Modeling, Simulation, and Training; Combat Weather; Military Information <br />Support Operation (MISO) and Civil Affairs (CA)<br /><br />- May 2012: Warrior Systems; Small Team Weapons <br /><br />- August 2012: Mobility and Vehicle Protection</p>
<p>Additional RFIs will be released to FedBizOpps approximately 60 days prior to each scheduled TNT event to provide additional details.</p>
<p>After review of the technology experimentation paper submissions, the Government may invite select candidates to experiment their technologies at the USSOCOM &amp; NPS sponsored TNT experimentation event. The TNT venue will provide an opportunity for the submitter to interact with USSOCOM personnel for the purpose of USSOCOM assessing potential impact of emerging technology solutions on USSOCOM missions and capabilities. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighter. Industry participation in experimentation activities does not suggest or imply that USSOCOM or NPS will procure or purchase equipment.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVE:<br /><br />1. Background: USSOCOM conducts quarterly TNT experimentation events in cooperation with NPS at Camp Roberts, CA (three per year) and at Avon Park, FL (one per year). These cooperative TNT experiments are conducted with representatives from Government R&amp;D organizations, academia, and private industry. TNT experimentation events provide an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel to determine how their technology development efforts and ideas may support or enhance SOF capability needs. The environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between Government, academia, and industry to promote the identification and assessment of emerging and mature technologies for the primary goal of accelerating the delivery of technology discoveries to the SOF warfighter.</p>
<p>Mission-Based Experimentation (MBE) provides remedied solutions to identified high priority, high value SOF mission deficiencies allowing evolution and adaptation in the field to quickly help identify solutions designed to mission objectives. The Government's intent is to take selected respondent technology into unimproved expeditionary-like conditions for up to three (3) days and return the submitted technology to respondent upon completion of exercise. All respondents will be required to complete a vendor loan agreement (see attachment) to participate in the MBE. Materiel solutions should be at a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 or greater for the purpose of MBE.<br /><br />Capability-Based Experimentation (CBE) provides an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel and determine how their efforts might support special operations capabilities in a discovery learning environment. A discovery learning environment includes interaction and collaboration between industry, government labs, academia and other government interests. CBE identifies potential technology solutions, impacts, limitations, and utility to meet SOF technical objectives and thrust areas. Materiel solutions should be at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or greater for the purpose of CBE. CBE experiments will be between a half day and five days in duration and be conducted in unimproved expeditionary-like conditions.</p>
<p>2. Experimentation Focus: Experiments will be conducted from 7-17 February 2012, at Avon Park, FL. The venue will explore emerging technology solutions for: Mission Planning, Modeling, Simulation, and Training; Combat Weather; Military Information Support Operation (MISO) and Civil Affairs (CA). Technology will need to be capable of supporting a SOF team up to 18 members to provide an increased security, enhanced situational awareness, and increased mission effectiveness.<br /><br />(a) MBE 12-2: 07-11 February 2012 at Avon Park, FL. Focus: MBE 12-2 will focus on Mission Planning, Training, Military Information Support Operation (MISO) and Civil Affairs (CA). Technology should be at Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL-6) or greater for the purpose of MBE. Any and all solutions must provide all necessary software and hardware to accomplish the mission. A SOF three to six member team will be at an unimproved remote village site and must be able to operate independent of other sustainment bases and facilities. Mission planning may include simulation, virtual interview training, modeling, and virtual sand table mission rehearsals. MISO and CA capabilities may include: Human terrain mapping, civil and social terrain mapping, information, production and dissemination technologies. Systems with attributes resulting in simplifications to existing tasks, procedures, and/or equipment operation and improvement in training, emplacement, and/or operation are desired. Additional MISO and CA measures considered would be systems that interpret MISO and CA situations along with analytical software for predictive analysis of possible SOF solutions to MISO and CA situations. <br /><br />(b) CBE 12-2 12-17 February 2012 at Avon Park, FL. Focus: CBE 12-2 will focus on Mission Planning, Modeling, Simulation, and Weather on Target. Experiments will be conducted to explore the application of emerging technology solutions for Mission Planning, Modeling, Simulation, and Weather on Target, both current and forecast. Technology should be at Technology Readiness Level 3 (TRL-3) or greater for the purpose of CBE. <br /><br />3. Security Requirements: Vendors should not submit classified information in the technology experimentation papers.<br /><br />4. Other Special Requirements: DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS. SUBMIT TECHNOLOGY EXPERIMENTATION PAPERS ONLY. EXPERIMENTATION PAPER SUBMITTALS WILL ONLY BE ACCEPTED WITHIN A 30 DAY SUBMISSION PERIOD DEFINED AS 60-30 DAYS PRIOR TO EACH SPECIFIED TNT EVENT. For the February TNT at Avon Park, FL., all submissions must be received no later than 23 December 2011. No contracts will be awarded based solely on this announcement or any subsequent supplemental RFI announcements planned for the June and August 2012 TNT events.</p>
<p>C. SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:<br /><br />Technology Experimentation papers shall be submitted electronically via USSOCOM webpage: http://www.socom.mil/_layouts/FormServer.aspx?XsnLocation=/FormServerTemplates/whitepapersubmission.xsn&amp;OpenIn=Browser. Multiple concept papers addressing different technology experiments may be submitted by each respondent. Submissions will be reviewed by USSOCOM personnel, support contractors, or NPS Faculty, Staff, or students. Each technology experiment paper must address only one experiment.<br />Select respondents will be invited to participate in USSOCOM experiments. USSOCOM shall provide venues, supporting infrastructure, and assessment (operational and technical) personnel at no cost to invited respondent(s). Respondent's travel costs and technology experiments will be at the respondent's expense. The TNT venue will only supply basic venue infrastructure including frequency allocation and portable power. Invited respondents should prepare to be self-efficient during experimentation and not dependent on venue resources for success.<br /><br />D. BASIS FOR SELECTION TO PARTICIPATE:<br />Selection of respondents to participate will be based on the extent to which the technology represents a particular class or level of capability that can be provided to Special Operations Forces. <br /><br />Other considerations include:<br />- Technical maturity<br />- Relevance of or adaptability to military operations/missions<br />- Relevance to current operational needs<br />- Relevant to Event Focus Area<br /><br />E.

<AWARDEE>Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems, One Rancho Carmel Drive, San Diego, CA 92128-3403 US
<DESC>ESC/HNAK has awarded a modification to Contract FA8726-09-C-0010 held by Northrop Grumman Information Systems for a Continuous Airworthiness Maintenance Plan (CAMP) Level "8C" inspection of USAF aircraft E-11A, Serial Number 11-9001 equipped with the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN). This is a commercial derived aircraft (Bombardier BD-700-1A10 Global Express model) modified to carry the BACN payload. The modification also provides for the over-and-above correction of deficiencies disclosed during the inspection and for the re-certification of airworthiness following the CAMP inspection. The modification provides options for the re-painting of the aircraft&nbsp;as needed and for operation and logistics support of the system deployed in support of Overseas Contingency Operations following conclusion of the airworthiness re-certification for a period of 6 months. <br />This contract action was a sole source award under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). A Justification and Approval for other than full and open competition is attached. Direct any questions concerning this award to Mr. Walter Ronten at (781)225-4109 or e-mail: walter.ronten@hanscom.af.mil. <br />
