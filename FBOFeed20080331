<DESC>Sources sought synopsis was previously accomplished under FA6643-08-1234. The solicitation number for this requirement will now be FA6643-08-R-0009.
This requirement is for services needed for the operation, management, and sustainment of Air Force Reserve (AFR) Financial Management Systems.  Headquarter AFRC, Financial Management Directorate, located at Robins AFB GA, is responsible for the management, design, development, implementation and maintenance of unique Air Force Reserve Financial Management Systems.  These Financial Management Systems process pay and budget information for AFR and active duty personnel located throughout the United States, which include locations at HQ AFRC Robins AFB GA; SAF/RE Washington DC; and ARPC Denver CO.  AFRC/FM systems also support certain common Reserve component financial applications and data bases in use at such places as the Air National Guard and all active duty locations.  The financial data produced by these systems is transferred through various communications networks such as local area networks (LAN), wide are networks (WAN), and Defense Data Networks (DDN). The planned acquisition strategy is to award a five-year contract (a basic plus four one-year option periods).  The contract will primarily consist of: (1) programming and maintenance of 12 financial management systems and related software: (2) Help-Desk services to provide daily assistance to personnel to support these systems; (3) software releases for the financial management systems and maintenance training on those software releases; (4) database administration for consolidated databases located throughout the United States; and (5) connectivity issues for FM servers to include port allocation requirements and troubleshooting.  The requirement will also include the provision of IT materials required to support the effort.  The objectives of this requirement are to: (1) Provide software engineering, software programming, software life cycle management (SLCM), network, help desk, financial management functional expertise, and security support for Financial Management Systems.

(3) Provide Software reengineering of several PC-based and MAPPER mainframe-based systems into .NET web-based systems.  The updated financial management systems will employ centralized processing techniques on networked file servers or web servers. This will result in more efficient processing and elimination of redundant data storage.

1.0 PREAMBLE ABOUT ACQUIRED UNIQUE SUPPLIES/ANCILLARY SERVICES:
This specifies unique commercial supplies/services to remove and replace nine (9) Teledyne opacity monitors (serial number controlled) with 9 new Teledyne opacity monitors and associated equipment at each heat plant at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) Ohio.  Acquisition costs and mission performance risks prohibit replacing existing Teledyne equipment infrastructure with non-Teledyne opacity monitors.  This specifies WPAFB technical requirements inherent with buying nine (9) non-national stock numbered commodity items.  Acquired commodity items are equipment identified as Instruments and Related Products Manufacturing for Measuring, Displaying, and Controlling Industrial Process Variables (North American Industry Classification System, NAICS 334513.  Only one company, TEMCO, has integrated capabilities required to achieve WPAFB specifications and delivery schedule requirements.  Only TEMCO, a small business, has sufficient integrated capabilties to achieve WPAFB requirements because the Original Equipment Manufacturer of all Teledyne opacity monitors has designated TEMCO to be the exclusive sales and installation representative for all Teledyne equipment sold in significant quantities to cities, universities, and power compainies through out Ohio and Kentucky.  

 2.0 SPECIFICATIONS AND DELIVERY SCHEDULE FOR UNIQUE SUPPLIES/ ANCILLARY SERVICES:  Supplies/services to be acquired are nine unique Air Force commodity items because only the Original Equipment Manufacturer (Teledyne) manufactures Teledyne Model 560 opacity monitors and associated equipment which are compatible with existing opacity monitors at WPAFB.  Teledyne opacity monitors used in each coal-fired heat plant are unique to WPAFB because WPAFB is the only air force base that uses opacity monitors to record pollution control compliance with U.S. EPA regulations.  Only WPAFB requires integrated manufacture, installation, removal of nine (9) Teledyne opacity monitors, compliance certification, initial consumable materials and repair parts.  The 36 month repair warranty will sustain tailored quality control over the existing WPAFB measurement process of 6 Teledyne opacity monitors configured for Facility 31240 and 4 Teledyne opacity monitors configured for Facility 20070.  Further Teledyne has authorized only TEMCO to sell and install all opacity monitors that achieve herein delivery schedule.  This delivery schedule identifies Not Later Than (NLT)  completion of all CEVY specifications Government acceptance in terms of weeks after award date (WAAD).

3.0 PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
Wright-Patterson AFB (WPAFB) is classified as a major source of air pollution under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) because of coal particulate emissions from two base heating plants. The base Title V Operating Permit requires WPAFB to continuously monitor coal emission opacity from four smoke stacks at heat plants, Facilities 770 and 1240.  These two coal-fired heat plant facilities provide heat to over 300 buildings in three areas of WPAFB (Area A, B, and C).  Both heat plants operate continuously, 24 hours per day and 7 days each week for 9 months each year.  These two facilities rely on automated opacity reading systems that use a total of ten (10) automated Teledyne Continuous Coal Emission Monitors (CEMs) to monitor coal-fire particulate emissions (air pollution) from Buildings 770 and 1240.  The system in Building 770 uses four CEMs, the Building 1240 uses six CEMs.  Both coal-fire heat plants use fabric filter bag-houses to reduce air pollution from WPAFB.  Maintenance of all ten CEMs is performed quarterly as required by the CAAA under a separate contract.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:           

PROJECT TITLE:  ASBESTOS ABATEMENT, BUILDING #262

SCOPE: 
The work includes furnishing all labor, materials, equipment, supervision, and transportation to remove and dispose of approximately 1,000 square feet of sprayed-on fireproof insulation. USCG Training Center Building No. 262, Cape May, New Jersey (Cape May county).    

In general the work includes but is not limited to the following:

1. The work area is located within the overhead space of Building 262, Room 210 and part of Room 213A.

2. Asbestos removal shall be performed by licensed workers and supervisors.

3. The asbestos to be removed is sprayed-on insulation in the overhead, above a drop ceiling. The area to be abated is approximately 1,000 sq ft.  The insulation is approximately 2 inches thick and is 35-40% asbestos.  Any contaminated outdated communication cabling will be removed.  The work will occur in an office and a portion of the hallway.  All office furniture will be moved by Government personnel.  During removal, all asbestos waste shall be thoroughly wetted.  Contractor shall ensure water does not seep through the second floor to the first floor.  Negative air controls will be constructed and maintained throughout the abatement. The area to be abated must be completely isolated from the rest of the second floor overhead.  Plastic sheeting shall be placed on the walls and floors sealing all the entrances.  'Danger asbestos' signs shall be placed on the exterior plastic sheeting.  Ceiling tiles, the metal grid, and lighting fixtures will be removed and disposed of to expose the sprayed on insulation.  Exact delineation of the area to be abated will be done by government personnel.  Seal the ceiling around the delineated area to the top of the drop ceiling with plastic sheeting. Plastic sheeting will be adhered to the abated ceiling.  This critical barrier shall be constructed to remain in tact for at least 1 year.  If the barrier is to fail during this time, the contractor will be called back to repair and abate, as necessary.

4. Build a stage 3 Decon unit in the hallway outside Room 210. 

5. Area Cleanup and Decontamination: Prior to commencement of abatement activities, a pre-cleaning shall be accomplished by High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) vacuuming and wet wiping of the regulated work area. All exposed surfaces and equipment shall be vacuumed and wet wiped. Meticulous attention shall be given to restrict the spread of dust and debris. Particular attention shall be given to areas which are immediately adjacent to the work area, or which could harbor accumulations or residual asbestos dust. Post abatement clean-up shall consist of the same activities. Should the abatement area not pass final inspection, the Contractor shall re-clean to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. A post removal encapsulant (lockdown) shall be applied to the areas that were abated.

6. Waste Disposal: Asbestos waste, scrap, debris, bags, HEPA filters, equipment, and contaminated clothing shall be collected and placed in sealed leak-tight approved containers (e.g. double 6-mil bags). Waste must be wetted in case of a breach. A warning and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) label shall be affixed or preprinted on each container. Waste shall be disposed of at an approved landfill. Temporary storage shall be sealed in impermeable containers and placed in a location assigned by government personnel. Procedure for hauling, disposal, and completion of the Waste Shipment Record shall comply with 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart M. The Contractor shall complete and provide final copies of the Waste Shipment Record within 3 days of delivery to the landfill.

7. Air Monitoring: Sampling and analysis of airborne concentration of asbestos fibers shall be performed in accordance with 29 CFR Part 1926. All results shall be posted in the work area and copies provided to the Contracting Officer.

Period of Performance shall be 45 days after issuance of Notice to Proceed.     

This procurement is estimated BETWEEN $25,000.00 and $100,000.00.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 562910 with a size standard of $13 million.

<DESC>Training System Acquisition VH-60N and VH-3D Aircrew Procedures Trainers (APTs) Muti-Option Contract.

Naval Air Systems Command Training Systems Division (NAWC TSD) Orlando, intends to issue a Request for Proposal on or about 01 April 2008 with the intention to award a contract to upgrade the VH-60N and VH-3D Aircrew Procedures Trainers (APTs) under the Presidential Helicopter Program. This acquisition will award one base effort and have options for eight additional efforts. Offerors will have 30 days after the RFP published date, to submit proposals.
 
DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM EFFORTS:  The acquisition will maintain configuration of the APTs and aircrew training with the Fleet aircraft along with a technology refresh to maintain the APTs in top efficiency. Commonality of VH-3D, VH-60N, and VH-71 Visual Systems/Databases is a goal of the program. 

The training device modification includes a visual upgrade, a technology refresh, the cockpit upgrade program (CUP), a flight model upgrade to incorporate the Carson rotor blade, correction of existing Trainer Engineering Change Requests (TECRs), an effort to maintain trainer concurrency with the VH In Service aircraft changes and modifications, and relocation of both devices to a new location on MCAF Quantico, Virginia.  

The base effort will be to upgrade the VH-60N APTs Computational Technology and Visual Systems.  The computational technology refresh will include replacement of the current host and image generator with a PC host, PC image generator and replace the existing visual database with Naval Aviation Simulator Master Plan (NASMP) Portable Source Initiative (PSI) database set.  This upgrade will keep the APT at peek efficiency until the VH-60N helicopter is retired. New hardware will have commonality with the VH-71 CPT to the maximum extent possible. Visual Databases from the VH-71 CPT will be integrated into the APT.

All additional efforts will be options on the resulting contract as funding becomes available.  There will be an option effort to upgrade the VH-3D APT Computational Technology and Visual Systems as described above for the VH-60N APT.

Another option effort will be to upgrade the VH-60N APT to a glass cockpit and provide applicable modifications.  The VH-60N aircraft is incorporating state of the art technologies that will provide improved electronic displays and upgrades pilot communications and navigation capabilities (glass cockpit).  The upgrade will be utilizing avionics, equipment and software utilized by other DOD aircraft to maintain commonality and supportability for future life cycle support. The upgrade will require the removal of the current instrumentation system and the incorporation of glass cockpit multifunction displays and associated weapons replaceable assemblies/wiring. Some software conversion of the instructor operator station and new digital interface code will need to be written.

The next option effort for the trainer modification requirement will be to modify the existing VH-3D APT aerodynamic model to account for the new Carson main rotor blade.  This program will replace the existing VH-3D metal Main Rotor Blades (MRB) with a newly designed composite MRB.  The new MRB was designed by Carson Helicopters of Perkasie, PA utilizing NASA designed airfoil sections and state of the art materials.  The rotor blade offers significant increases in performance and flight envelope over the current metal blades.  Aerodynamic model data will be recorded via the VH-3D Lift Improvement Program and will be used to modify the existing VH-3D APT aerodynamic model.

The next option effort for the trainer modification requirement will be the correction of existing Trainer Engineering Change Requests (TECRs) which will be divided in four different lots. The Government intends to award as many TECRs as possible at time of contract award depending on funding availability.  The last option effort is for the relocation of both devices to a location within the boundaries of MCAF Quantico, Virginia.

Period of Performance: Varies per CLIN, Overall is 5 years.

Sources:   Sources will be limited to the Training Systems Contract (TSC) II Lot I Small business firms. 

GFE/GFI Requirements: The Government will provide all WRAs required from the B kit and cockpit peculiar hardware from the A kit for the VH-60N glass cockpit upgrade by the end of FY07.  EDT software and information may be used for developmental efforts.  VH-60N and VH-3D APT IOS and host software in addition to each APTs document library may be made available upon contractor request.

Security Considerations: If a foreign company is a subcontractor, the prime contractor will be responsible for complying with the import/export treaties. The use of foreign nationals inside of the HMX-1 squadron spaces may require Secret or above security clearance.  The APTs are unclassified.

Proprietary Data: The VH-60N and VH-3D APTs were procured with full data rights. The contract will require contractors to provide data without restrictions on documentation and software.

Contract Approach:  The acquisition will be made via the Small Business open competition under Lot I of the Training Systems Contract (TSC) II Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (ID/IQC) contract as Firm Fixed Price. Contract payment schedule will be performance-based payments based on significant milestone events. Events are not limited to, but include engineering design reviews, testing events and delivery of documentation. A percentage of the total contract value will be assigned to each event.

Management Approach:  All efforts will be conducted by utilizing the Integrated Product/Process Development (IPPD) approach.  An Integrated Product Team (IPT) will be formed with appropriate roles and responsibilities delineated by team assignment agreement for government personnel.  The contractor will provide personnel for those teams.  The RFT dates below are not based on Fleet requirements but are an estimate of the completion date based on other simulator modifications of this magnitude.

Romania: Next Generation Network Infrastructure for Emergency Management Project ("Project").

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to perform Technical Assistance ("TA") with the development of a Next Generation Network ("NGN"), which will upgrade existing telecommunications infrastructure and improve the Romanian government's capacity to manage possible as well as actual emergencies.

The Grantee is a public institution of the Host Country, organized and functioning under the Law no. 92/1996, that oversees and coordinates information and communications technology activities for public authorities and others as specified by law. The Grantee is responsible for providing communications network services for emergency management (including multiple emergency management agencies within government as well as first responder organizations).  In the first phase of a World Bank Hazard Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness Project being implemented in Romania, plans were made for an Emergency Management Information System (EMIS). Though EMIS is not yet officially underway, realization of the Project will ensure the proper functioning and capacity for the EMIS system and its various software applications (many of which use image data and other high-data volume files).

More generally, existing telecommunications infrastructure in Romania is limited in its functionality, bandwidth capacity, geographical reach and transmission/storage security. The Romanian government, through the Grantee, intends to develop an NGN that will address these shortcomings via a comprehensive ICT system upgrade. In addition to its explicit objective ? enabling considerable, sweeping improvements in emergency management and response capabilities across the nation ? the Project will provide a functional blueprint for future ICT upgrades in a number of other areas, which ultimately will result in the Romanian government's total reliance on a faster, more dependable and entirely interconnected telecommunications infrastructure in and among ministries and other facilities.


The Grantee requires the services of a Contractor to complete the following Tasks for this Technical Assistance:
TASK 1: 	Network Infrastructure Assessment
TASK 2: 	Satisfying EMIS Performance Requirements
TASK 3: 	Blueprint for Next-Generation Emergency Management Network
TASK 4: 	Enhanced Network Functionality and Capacity to Support Geospatial Information Systems and Critical Incident Management Systems
TASK 5: 	Planning and Advisory Services
TASK 6: 	Implementation and Financing Plan
TASK 7: 	Development Impact Analysis
TASK 8: 	Regulatory Review and Preliminary Environmental Analysis
TASK 9: 	Final Report 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $700,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:

https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00pm local time on May 14, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/ Acquisition Management Division (AMD), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, on behalf of the NIST/Ceramics Division, with Veeco Metrology of Tuscon, Arizona for an upgrade to an existing Veeco Dimension 3100 Atomic Force Microscope (AFM).

The Ceramics Division conducts programs pertinent to measurement issues for ceramic materials through fundamental and applied research, the development of standard test methodologies, the preparation of standard reference materials, and the 
evaluation and dissemination of standard reference data.  The Nanomechanical Properties Group, within the Ceramics Division, specializes in material property measurements at very small scales such as those observed in atomic force microscopes. 

The upgrade being purchased is for an existing Veeco Dimension 3100 AFM.  This upgrade is required to extend current nanoscale imaging and analysis capabilities.  

The upgrade will:
1.  Replace key components, i.e. controller and scanner; 
2.  Provide a Nanoscope V controller;
3.  Provide a new PC running AFM software version 7.2 or greater with NanoMan nanomanipulation and nanolithography software;
4.  Provide a new closed loop hybrid xyz scanner (patented);
5.  Insert a new electronics back plane into the Dimension 3100 Base.

The equipment will be used to perform research on the topography, and nanomechanical properties of a wide range of research materials including metals, ceramics, semiconductors, and polymers.  In addition, it will enable NIST to expand its? capabilities on new methods for calibrating the flexural spring constant of test cantilevers to include the thermal calibration method.  The ability to image at 5,000 x 5,000 pixels represents an approximate 10x improvement over previous capabilities with the instrument.  

Closed loop capability ensured accuracy and precision in the location of features in the xy plane.  High speed multiple lock-in and digital "Q" control offers enhanced surface analysis capabilities.  All of these will improve NIST?s ability to participate in round robin exercises for International round robins on AFM standardization (VAMAS & ISO).

The contemplated effort is a follow-on acquisition to continue development on a highly specialized piece of equipment as described in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  This system being procured is an upgrade to the existing equipment 

NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.  
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly 
specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in?
(A)  Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B)  Unacceptable delays fulfilling the agency?s requirements.
(See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B)

The existing equipment and the upgrade are commercial items.  
The upgrade must be hardware and software compatible with the existing equipment.  Veeco has developed the technology and has proprietary rights to that technology; No other vendor has rights to Veeco?s proprietary hardware and software.  

Veeco has no distributors, therefore, they are the only source who can provide this upgrade.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by April 15, 2008, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to issue a sole source modification to FN Herstal S.A., Voie de Liege, 33, B-4040 Herstal-Belgium, via existing contract H92222-05-D-0001 to refine the Fire Control System for the Enhanced Grenade Launcher.

The authority for the proposed acquisition will be conducted without providing for full and open competition pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.  

This synopsis is for enhanced/medium range 600m (T) and 800m (O) 40MM ammunition that can be safely and effectively employed from a shoulder fired grenade launcher. Ammunition shall be compatible with the 40mm Enhanced Grenade Launcher Module (EGLM) either in stand alone configuration or as mounted in modular fashion to the Special Operations Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR). The range increase has changed from the current 40mm low velocity ammunition performance (300-400 meters) to a range of approximately 600m (T) to 800m (O).  The round must be capable of a minimum range of 600m with increased accuracy over current 40MM low velocity ammunition utilized in the M203.   

The ammunition is required to integrate and test the EGLM to ensure the performance requirements (such as range) are met.  FN Herstal, manufacturer of the EGLM and SCAR will be acting as integrator between the weapon and the enhanced ammunition. 

After successful demonstration of this integration effort, it is the intent of the Government to procure the enhanced 40mm ammunition via full and open competition.

<DESC>It is the intention of the Government to award a sole source procurement to Signal Technology Corp. DBA Advanced Integrated Systems Division, 1820 Preston Park Blvd., Suite 2800, Plano, TX 75093.  This sole source procurement is for Phase II of the Networked Microsensor Test Bed program.  In phase I of the program, an architecture was developed and initial system design was completed.  In phase II of the program the design will be finalized, hardware will be fabricated, software developed, the system will be integrated, and hardware in the loop simulations will be conducted to establish baseline functionality.  Typically when wireless sensor networks are developed the developer creates a test bed to aid in creation of networking software and conducting initial system testing.  Rather than creating test beds for each development effort the Networked Microsensor Test Bed, which will individually be located at University of Texas, Dallas (UTD), will serve as a national asset available to military and commercial developers of wireless sensor networks.  The contractor has used private funds to augment the development effort leading to proprietary Intellectual Property (IP).  The anticipated period of performance is 14 months after date of award.  If you are interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation, please contact Dawn Doster at (916)231-1521 or doster@dmea.osd.mil .

Description

DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM), Northeast Region (NERO), plans to offer the privatization of the water and wastewater distribution systems at Aberdeen Proving Ground - Edgewood, MD.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the systems to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Offerors will not be required to submit offers on all of the utility systems and may submit offers on individual system(s) or on groups of systems on an all or none basis.  For purposes of economic comparison required by 10 U.S.C. 2688, each system will be analyzed and considered for award separately.

The Utility System being privatized is described as follows:

INSTALLATION DESCRIPTION:

Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) is located in Harford County midway between Baltimore, Maryland, and Wilmington, Delaware. It occupies more than 72,500 acres in Harford County, Maryland. The installation is served by two major arteries, U.S. Route 40 and Interstate 95, both of which connect with the New Jersey Turnpike and the Baltimore-Washington Expressway. 

Opened in 1917, Aberdeen Proving Ground ? Edgewood Area (APG?EA) is the Army?s oldest active proving ground.  APG?EA is home to the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command, and is home to approximately 50 tenant activities with a daytime population of about 10,000. 

Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope, and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

Description of Facilities:  The utility systems consist of the following estimated Capital assets:

A.   Potable Water System Description
The APG-EA potable water system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the system. The system may include, but is not limited to, water source treatment facilities, pump stations, pipelines, valves, fire hydrants, storage facilities, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be conveyed to the Contractor using the Bill of Sale at the time the system is transferred. 
Water Source
APG-EA is supplied potable water from two sources. One source is the Winters Run River and the other is from Harford County.
The water from Winters Run River is withdrawn from the river, treated and supplied to the water system. Water from Harford County is supplied as potable water and is directly supplied to the water distribution system without any further treatment.
Winter Run River Water Supply
On the Winters Run River is a small dam, Van Bibber Dam. The dam has an approximate height of 15 feet. The dam backs up water in the river so it can be withdrawn through the plant?s intake structure into the APG-EA water treatment plant. Van Bibber Dam consists of an ogee weir, outlet structure, and a fish ladder.  The dam provides very little reservoir storage capacity. The dam and water treatment plant were initially constructed in the 1940s.
The design capacity of the water treatment plant is 4.0 MGD; however, due to equipment constraints the actual capacity is nearer 2.0 MGD. The average daily water production at the plant is approximately 1.0 MGD. The plant is manned 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.  
The plant is manually operated but has a SCADA system that provides information to the plant operators. The system provides turbidity of the inlet and finish water, headloss across each sand filter, operating status of finish water pumps, and the water level in the Hanson Reservoir.
Distribution System
Facilities within the boundary of APG-EA are supplied with potable water by the network of water pipes. All potable water supplied to APG-EA is via the 10-, 14-, and 24-inch lines from Hanson Reservoir. The pressure reducing valves on each of the supply lines near the northern edge of APG-EA reduce the pressure to 55 psi as it enters the APG-EA water distribution system.
The potable water distribution system is interconnected at various locations to create a looped distribution network. Most of the lines were installed in the 1940s and only minor additions or upgrades have been made to the system since then. The system is considered to be in poor to average condition with some section of lines considered to be in unacceptable condition.  Generally, there are an adequate number of water valves at the pipe junctions to isolate sections of pipes for maintenance. However, many of the valves are reported to be in poor condition. The valves in the 5000 area are reported to be in unacceptable condition. Recently, many of the repairs to the water system have been completed under pressure, as isolation valves that would normally isolate the line could not be closed.
B.  Wastewater System Description
The wastewater system at APG-EA consists of collection lines, lift stations with force main, and a wastewater treatment plant. At some of the outlying facilities wastewater flows to septic tanks, and drain fields for treatment and disposal. The actual inventory of items sold will be conveyed to the Contractor using the Bill of Sale at the time the system is transferred.
Collection Lines
The wastewater generated generally flows from the facility to gravity collections lines where it flows to the wastewater plant located in the southeast portion of APG-EA. Some collection lines flow to lift stations where the wastewater is pumped to a gravity line through which it flows to the wastewater treatment plant.
Most of the wastewater lines at APG-EA were installed in the early 1940s. The most common type of collection pipe material is vitrified clay and the most common pipe diameter is 8 inches. Since the 1940s only minor areas have been added and there have been only minor upgrades within the system. From 1988 through 1995, approximately 30 percent of the collection lines have been relined.  
The wastewater collection system consists of pipe sizes raging from 1.5 inches to 30 inches. The total length of the pipes is 39.5 miles. 
The Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations governing the operation of the water and wastewater distribution systems.

Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of an Easement as an attachment to the resultant contract.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the solicitation.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit an offer.  All ?other than small? businesses shall submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.

Interested sources shall contact Jordan Salata at Jordan.Salata@dla.mil to be added to our mass bidders E-mail list.  A copy of the solicitation will be available, after issuance - on or after April 15, 2008, on FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) and the DESC webpage at: http://www.desc.dla.mil/DCM/DCMPage.asp?pageid=246.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to attach answers to questions and to attach an originally overlooked attachment titled, "Clinical Guidelines, 14 Feb 08".

1.     The SOW makes reference to RECYCLE RATE rate on page 2, Institutional Requirements , item 1. 2), then again in Appendix E, the SOW refers to ATTRITION RATE.  Are these terms being used interchangeably?  Under the current contract a RECYCLE is a student who fails a section of the course and is then recycled into the next available course.  Where as a WASHOUT is a student who has failed twice and is removed from the program.  Under the current contract and for CoAEMSP standards, it is only the WASHOUT student who is counted in the attrition rate, will this be the same in the new contract?

2.     Reference ATTRITION RATE, is this counting only students who failed due to academics, or does it included students removed from the program for any reason (disciplinary or personal issues, and academic)?

3.     In Appendix E, I am assume the 15% in item 4 is an error.

4.     In the actual Solicitation, page 12, towards the bottom, under INVOICING/PAYMENT.  None of the options apply, since billing has been done per class.  I understand this is a new contract, how does the USAF wish the invoicing to be done, per class, or annually or monthly as stated in the Solicitation?

5.     It is our assumption in constricting our pricing breakdown, there has been no changes what so ever in the POIs currently being used, and those POIs will the ones used in the new contract.  Am I correct?  If not, can you forward any POIs which have been changed, in particular the POIs pertaining to Labs and clinical. 


6.     Reference the SOW, page 4...
8) coordinate, set-up, and assume all fees associated with anatomy lab experiences for Kirtland AFB based classes with the exception of transportation which will be coordinated and supplied by the USAF.  

Will all classes, including those off site, required to have an anatomy lab?


1.  The terms RECYLCE RATE and ATTRITION RATE are interchangeable.  The definition is--when a student fails to meet academic requirements and is removed from the class.  This will be one of the Performance Objectives for the contract.  The term WASHOUT is a term that refers to a student who is completely removed from the program for either academic or administrative reasons.  The contractor will not be held responsible for administrative WASHOUTS or administrative RECYCLES.  

2.  Attrition rates for the purpose of measuring the Performance Objectives will only count students who are academic RECYCLES or WASHOUTS as opposed to students who are RECYCLES or WASHOUTS by the USAF for non-academic reasons.

3.  In Appendix E, the Performance Threshold, Item 4, for EMT-Paramedic does have a type error. This will be changed to read--Class attrition rates greater than 12% will result in contractor being fined 10% of annual invoices.

4.  Invoicing will be completed for each individual EMT-Basic and EMT-Paramedic class utilizing factors in Appendix A.  Invoicing will be completed utilizing the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) web enabled application.

5.  All Plans of Instruction for each training program have been updated to reflect vendor text updates and program structural changes.  The Statement of Work includes a copy of each courses Syllabus and schedule.  These documents indicate exactly how each block of instruction is to include hours dedicated to each lecture or skill lab and also indicate how many instructors are required. When reviewing the schedule for EMT-Basic please reference the box labeled MIR requirement and it identifies the instructor to student ratio.  When reviewing the schedule for EMT-Paramedic please reference the box labeled Instructors assigned and it also identifies the instructor to student ratio.  Most skill labs have a 4:1 instructor to student ratio.  NREMT skill testing and Clinical rotations have higher ratios. 

6.  Per the EMT-Paramedic schedule (training day 48) all classes will be required to attend and A&P Cadaver Lab.  Since this training experience is limited to 4.5 hours it is understood that this training will be limited to within the Albuquerque NM area.  The USAF currently utilizes the Cadaver Lab at the University of New Mexico and will work with the contractor if needed to establish any required MOU to continue utilizing this facility.

Also, per the EMT-Paramedic schedule, if the Cadaver Lab is not available for use the Paramedic class will conduct skill training drills in place of the Cadaver Lab utilizing the required 4:1 instructor student ratio.

NOTE:  Attached is the Clinical Guidelines which needs to be posted as part of the solicitation.

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for public architecture, engineering, and construction through a Design-Build / Bridging delivery method.      

GSA intends to award one (1) firm-fixed price Design-Build contract for all design and construction services necessary for Site Utility Upgrades ? 13.8kV Primary Electrical Distribution System located at the Nebraska Avenue Complex, 3801 Nebraska Avenue, NW,  Washington, DC, Procurement Request Number WPJ-08-0289.  The Site Utility Upgrades ? 13.8kV Primary Electrical Distribution System is a renovation of an electrical system on an occupied facility.   

Construction completion and final acceptance is expected to occur on or before December 29, 2010.  The anticipated cost for the project is between $20,000,000 and $30,000,000, and will consist of a renovation of an electrical system on an occupied facility.  

The proposed site covers approximately 25 acres, bounded by Nebraska Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, Rock Creek, and private property.   The scope of the project is to provide a three feeder spot network electrical system including utility metering switchgear, underground distribution, underground vaults and connections to the existing buildings. Critical programmatic requirements include the need to keep the existing buildings in operation until the new system is complete.  

The design-build scope of work includes all engineering, civil, architectural /structural, design, construction, and other related services necessary to design and to construct the electrical distribution system.  Related services include, but are not limited to, geotechnical evaluation and monitoring, archaeological monitoring, permitting, testing and inspection during construction, commissioning and potential additional geotechnical analysis of the site.  Preliminary approvals have been secured from National Capital Planning Commission for the current design. Additional submissions will be required to secure final approvals.

This project requires the construction of a new primary electrical system including underground utility metering vault, duct banks, underground network transformer vaults, connection to existing electrical systems and removal of the existing electrical system, including salvage of designated equipment at the Nebraska Avenue Complex, together with associated mechanical, electrical and general construction work. Work includes selective demolition of existing electrical system and storm water system, and provision of underground electrical substation vaults, electrical distribution system, spot network substations, including transformers and switchgear, medium voltage metering switchgear and cabling, PEPCO connections, switchboards, connections to existing electrical system, temporary wiring, excavation and backfill and surface restoration and incidental related work.

Disciplines anticipated include electrical engineering, structural engineering, civil engineering, architecture, and horticulture.

The Contractor shall provide all the necessary labor, materials, supervision, management, quality control plan and testing to produce a finished and operational electrical system conforming to the contract documents.

The completed project will meet or exceed all Federal design and construction statutes, standards, and regulations, including but not limited to the energy goals stated in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards, and Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection measures.

The design of the engineering and architectural features of the project shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by engineers and architects registered to practice in their particular field within the District of Columbia.  The architect-engineer portion of this design-build entity must be a firm or joint venture having an existing active office located within the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  This existing active office will have the responsibility for providing the architectural and engineering services.

Offerors, individually or as a team, must have the capacity to obtain performance and payment bonding for up to 100% of the firm-fixed-price Design-Build Contract.

While the contractor?s personnel will have to satisfy the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12, the Government does not anticipate that any special security clearance (i.e., TOP SECRET) will be required to participate in this procurement.  

GSA intends to award a firm-fixed-price design-build contract pursuant to the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 36.3 and Subpart 15.  The procurement will be completed in two phases: Phase 1 will be a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and Phase 2 will be a Request for Proposals (RFP).  During Phase 1, Offerors will prepare and submit their qualifications as specified in the RFQ package which will be issued on or about March 17, 2008, on the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  

The evaluation factors for Phase 1 are as follows:  1) Past Performance, 2) Technical Approach, 3) Specialized Experience and Technical Competency, and 4) Capability to Perform.  Refer to the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) package for details on the Phase 1 evaluation criteria and information for submittals.  On or about early May 2008, the Government anticipates extending invitations to a maximum of five (5) of the most highly qualified offerors to submit Phase 2 proposals, which will be due on or about mid June 2008.  The short listed firms will be issued the Request for Proposal (RFP) package and may undergo a presentation and review process under separate evaluation factors.  Details on the evaluation factors and submittals will be outlined in the RFP.  The Government anticipates making an award in July 2008.  This solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses.  However, this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (F.A.R. 52-219-19).  Any qualified responsible firm, including small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small businesses, is encouraged to participate as prime contractors, or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses, or as subcontractors.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment.  Consequently, an Offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction), must demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  YOU ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF UPLOAD OF THE RFQ AT THIS SITE AND REGISTER ON THE INTERESTED VENDOR LIST (IVL).  In accordance with the requirements of the RFQ, Phase 1 proposals shall be submitted approximately April 25, 2008, by 1:00 PM, EST, to the following address: GSA, NCR, ROB, Bid Activity (WPP) - Room 1065, Seventh and D Streets, SW, Washington, DC 20407.

MacDill AFB is located approximately eight miles south of downtown Tampa on the tip of the Interbay Peninsula in Hillsborough County, Florida.  The base is surrounded by Tampa Bay on the south and west; by Hillsborough Bay on the east, and by the city of Tampa on the north.  The base covers about 5,630 acres of land and has an approximate population of 5,322 active duty and 1,077 civilian personnel.  Based upon present real estate records, MacDill AFB provides operations and maintenance support for approximately 480 separate facilities, excluding Military Family Housing.  This includes approximately 67 administration facilities, 16 dormitories, and 10 Temporary Lodging Facilities.  The remaining facilities are considered commercial or industrial use facilities and range from small shop spaces to large maintenance hangars.

Natural Gas:  TECO Peoples Gas supplies natural gas to the base.  A single eight-inch pipeline provides gas service for the entire base.  Service is provided to the base at a pressure of 10 pounds per square inch guage.  All equipment downstream of the manifold is owned, operated and maintained by MacDill AFB personnel.  The on-base distribution system consists of approximately 78,350 linear feet of underground piping; 65% PE and 35% steel, with 99% of it being installed in the 1970's.  There are approximately 445 valves ranging in size from 0.75 to 8 inches; 33 meters ranging in size from 1.25 to 8 inches; and 239, 1.25 inch regulators.  The majority of the pipe and valves were installed in the 1970's and the meters and regulators were installed in 1941.

Potable Water: MacDill AFB purchases all its potable water from the City of Tampa.  The City's Hillsborough River Water Treatment Plant, a surface water plant that utilizes the Hillsborough River as its primary source, provides about 75% to 90% of the water supply for the Tampa area.  The remaining 10% to 25% is supplied by the City's Morris Bridge Water Treatment Plant, which utilizes water from a well field of 20 wells in the Floridan Aquifer, and is located about 10 miles northeast of the Hillsborough River Plant.  MacDill has three City-owned, metered connections to the City system.  In the past two years, peak-month usage averaged about 1.3 to 1.4 MGD.  Delivered water pressure by the City is about 50 to 60 psig.  MacDill constructed a booster chloramine disinfection system in 2002.  Potable water is stored in two ground level and 2 elevated storage tanks.  Three of the tanks are 1941 vintage and one is 1956 vintage.  There are approximately 405,659 linear feet of pipe ranging in size from 0.75 to 20 inches.  Approximately 88% of the pipe was installed prior to 1960.  There are approximately 501 valves ranging from 2 to 20 inches; 85% installed prior to 1960.   There are approximately 290 hydrants, 39 meters, and 63 backflow preventers.

Wastewater: MacDill AFB owns, operates, and maintains the sewage collection and treatment system that serves the Base.  The average daily flow for the only wastewater treatment plant (installed in 1953) is 0.50 to 0.60 mgd with maximum daily flows of up to 2.0 mgd during wet weather.  The treatment plant permitted capacity is 1.2 mgd.  There are approximately 981,558 linear feet of pipe ranging from 0.5 to 24 inches.  Approximately 18% of the pipe was installed prior to 1960.  There are 61 lift stations, 32 installed prior to 1980.  There are 5 emergency generators, 274 brick manholes (1940 vintage), and 9 concrete manholes (2001 vintage).

<CONTACT>Karl Lautzenheiser Contracting Officer 5032312052     Karl_Lautzenheiser@fws.gov;
<DESC>The Spring Creek National Fish Hatchery in Underwood Washington spawns 8,000 to 10,000 fish annually with a total weight of over 200,000 lbs.  Carcasses need to be picked up daily through out the spawning season of  September 15 through October 5th.  The current program involves contracting with a trucking firm to transport spawned out carcasses to a rendering plant in Warrenton, Oregon where the product has been used to produce bio-blocks for stream enrichment projects.  Because these fish are anesthetized with a chemical called MS-222, they are not fit for human consumption.  Consequently, they need to be disposed of appropriately and final use of this product would have to be approved by Region 1 of the Fish and Wildlife Service.  Other sources are currently being sought that may be interested in the use of this product.  Interested firms may email Larry Marchant directly at Larry_Marchant@fws.gov and provide a brief description of the intended use along with a point of contact, phone number and email address.   Please copy Karl Lautzenheiser on the email message at Karl_Lautzenheiser@fws.gov.

<DESC>United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),  Central Region Acquisition Division, (CRAD) is seeking sources interested in DNA forensic identification of Atlantic billfishes for management, conservation and law enforcement for the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), at Miami, FL.

The NMFS, of Miami, FL has a need for continuing the research with DNA forensic identification method development of a highly streamlined assay for five Atlantic billfish species (blue marlin, white marlin, Atlantic sailfish, longbill spearfish, roundscale spearfish) of primary management interest.  This assay will provide a quick species identification capability for identifying adults at transshipment ports which have already been dressed at sea.  The work to be performed is described as follows:

	 (1)  To complete the studies on validation of a multiplex PCR forensic assay that has been developed to achieve unambiguous species discrimination of all five Atlantic billfish species simultaneously (including, most critically, the newly discovered roundscale spearfish) throughout their range. The multiplex assay developed includes an internal positive control mechanism and is streamlined enough to be subsequently adaptable for portable applications in fishing ports and on research and enforcement vessels.   (2)  	Use the forensic assay to continue our collaborative studies with NMFS SEFSC (Shivji et al. 2006; Beerkircher et al. 2008) initiated in 2005 investigating the Atlantic wide, spatial and temporal distribution of roundscale spearfish relative to white marlin and assess the frequency of mis-identification of roundscale spearfish as white marlin or longbill spearfish in Atlantic fisheries and (3)  Write and submit for peer-review publication manuscripts reporting (a)   the development, validation and use of the rapid DNA forensic technique for the 5 Atlantic billfish species (from Task 1), and (b) the results of prevalence and Atlantic-wide distribution of roundscale spearfish studies (from Task 2).

Historically, the equipment has been available from only one known source, Nova Southeastern University, Fort Lauderdale, FL.  Nova Southeastern University, through Dr. Shivji, has pioneered the development of a unique, highly streamlined forensic method to identify shark species, and this work in now being used routinely for fisheries regulation by NOAA?s Office for Law Enforcement.  Dr. Shivji?s laboratory, as the pioneer in development of the streamlined, multi-species forensic assay, is the only one with direct experience to finish developing a similar forensic assay for billfish.  They are 80% finished with this assay development process and this continued research will complete this project.   Given the complexity and specificity of this work, Dr. Shivji?s direct experience in processing and analyzing billfish tissues for species determination, the collection of billfish samples already in the lab and the critical need to maintain continuity with SEFSC staff, make him the only known source to accomplish the tasks identified in the statement of work.    Interested firms shall provide, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; and a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications to provide the services that meet or exceed the above mentioned requirements.  Responses can be faxed to Charlene Yaple @ 816-274-6977 or sent via email to Charlene.A.Yaple@noaa.gov.

<DESC>General A-E Services for Facilities at Various Locations within Transatlantic Programs Center's (TAC's) Area of Responsibility (AOR) (Refer to http://www.tac.usace.army.mil/Contracting/ae-industryday.html for a description of TAC's AOR.) Multiple Ind efinite Delivery Contracts (IDCs) for General Architect-Engineer Services procured in accordance with PL 92-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and FAR Part 36 are required for various types of facilities in the Transatlantic Programs Center's (TAC) Area of Responsibilit y. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. TAC's headquarters is located in Winchester, Virginia. TAC is responsible for execution of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' mission in Afr ica, the Middle East, the Arabian Gulf States, portions of Southwest Asia and any country where TAC is designated as the Program Manager. This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size. Funds for the basic contract and task orders are not c urrently available. All firms responding to this solicitation must have access to personnel with security clearances when required for specific task orders. <BR><BR>NOTE: All firms should be aware of the limitations of DFARS 236.602-70. This clause require s that A-E contracts funded by military construction appropriations that are estimated to exceed $500,000, and are to be performed in countries bordering the Arabian Gulf, can only be awarded to United States firms or to joint ventures of United States and  host nation firms. TAC's AOR contains many countries that border on the Arabian Gulf such as Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman and Yemen. In fact, the majority of the countries where TAC has a current presence and construction  work border the Arabian Gulf. Consequently, while this acquisition is to be issued as full and open to allow for the greatest amount of competition among qualified A-E firms, it is noted that at least 50%, if not more, of the task orders to be awarded (an d, consequently, a majority of the total dollar value of task order awards) under the new A-E IDCs will be limited to U.S firms or joint ventures involving U.S. firms. <BR><BR><BR> 1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: A-E services are required for Designs, Specificati ons, Cost Engineering, Planning and Programming Reports, Engineering Studies, Geotechnical and Topographical Investigations, Construction Management Services Support, Environmental Engineering and miscellaneous related engineering support services for vari ous locations/installations within the TAC AOR. Only firms who are committed to working on-site and in-country, either as the prime firm or with subcontractors, in all regions and areas within TAC's AOR, including Iraq and Afghanistan, will be considered f or this solicitation. TAC is not interested in firms who will work in only partial regions or areas of its AOR. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330. The maximum capacity of all contracts to be awarded under the new A- E IDCs shall not exceed $240 million. The new A-E IDCs will include a base year and four optional years for potential total contract duration of five years. Projected contract award date is 30 September 2008 for the initial one-year period. It is the Gover nment's intent to make multiple contract awards under a single solicitation. Each contract will have a guaranteed minimum amount that will be negotiated with each of the selected firms. If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with  FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for an acceptable subcontracting plan. The plan is not required to be included in the information submitted in response to this announcement. Work will be issued by task order, either cost-reimbursable, firm fixed-pr ice or labor-hour. However, it is TAC's intent to issue most task orders as firm fixed-price actions.  The task orders are anticipated to be equally distributed  among design, studies/investigation and construction management support services. However, this distribution may change depending upon the changing needs and contingency environment of TAC's AOR. The Contracting Officer will use a Fair Opportunity Process  (see FAR 16.505) for selecting a firm with whom to negotiate each task order. This process involves giving each selected firm an opportunity to indicate an interest for a specific task order under consideration and, if they are interested, requires them t o respond to specific technical criteria that will be used to determine the selected firm. These criteria are task order specific, and may include such items as the firm's experience with the task order assignment in the region in which the work is located , the expertise and experience of the personnel proposed for the task, and the capability of the firm to handle additional work. The Government may also require a progress schedule to demonstrate a firm's approach to a given task order. Responses are typic ally required to be three pages or less. Generally, for each task order only the selected firm will be given the opportunity to submit a price proposal. <BR><BR> 2.

<SUBJECT>R -- Intelligent Transportation System Program Support
<DESC>It is anticipated that this will be a SOLE-SOURCE procurement resulting in a SOLE-SOURCE contract.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to award one and only one contract, to the Intelligent Transportation Society of America (ITSA), on a SOLE-SOURCE basis.  It is anticipated that the SOLE-SOURCE award to ITSA will be in the form of an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contract, and that each particular task order, which will be issued to ITSA on a SOLE-SOURCE basis, will be cost-plus-fixed-fee.  It is estimated that ITSA?s resulting SOLE-SOURCE contract will have a two-year base period and three option years.  Under ITSA?s SOLE-SOURCE contract, ITSA will perform a series of activities designed to support the FHWA?s Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS/JPO) in meeting current and future challenges, including surface transportation management and operations.   In performing this SOLE-SOURCE contract, ITSA will be responsible for all aspects of the development and documentation of work and interaction with the stakeholder community.  As a part of that undertaking ITSA will also provide program management.  ITSA will set up and conduct workshops and stakeholder meetings and will conduct special studies regarding the ITS program.  For the following reasons among others, ITSA alone is considered to be uniquely qualified to perform this SOLE-SOURCE contract.  ITSA was formed specifically to create a bridge between the electronics industry and the transportation communities.  ITSA provides the only venue of its type for the discussion and guidance of the ITS program based upon its diverse membership.  ITSA is a non-profit, national association with over 600 members representing state and local government, the private sector and academia.  ITSA is the national organization dedicated to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).  Most private sector companies that produce ITS products and services, as well as the public sector users of those products and services, are members of ITSA.  Thus ITSA is the only venue where the public and private sectors are co-mingled to allow their combined viewpoints and knowledge to be brought to bear on ITS issues and problems.  Because of ITSA?s access to people and organizations needed for this project, and because its members alone possess all of the specialized technical expertise needed for the contract here envisioned, ITSA is uniquely qualified to successfully perform the activities contemplated herein.  Moreover, ITSA has an organization of established technical committees, forums, and programs that parallel the activities of the ITS JPO program.  The public and private organizations that would benefit from the products of this contract are part of ITSA?s membership and include those responsible for managing, designing, implementing, and maintaining transportation systems.  One of the primary strengths of ITSA is its ability to draw upon volunteer resources to blend experience from the public and private sectors.  Transportation professionals donate their time to serve on ITSA-sponsored forums, committees, and other groups that will play a part in the success of this project.  ITSA has 26 state chapters that provide a venue to reach the grass-roots deployers of ITS technology and to provide access to literally thousands of transportation professionals.  If, despite the existence of the above-mentioned overwhelming factual basis logically favoring ITSA as the only organization capable of satisfactorily executing the contract envisioned herein, any organization OTHER THAN ITSA believes that it can perform this project, then any such other organization shall submit one HARD-paper original and 10 HARD-paper copies of a complete Statement of Qualifications to the following address NOT LATER THAN 4:15 PM Eastern Standard Time on January 10, 2007:  Mr. James Mowery, Negotiator, Office of Acquisition Management (HAAM30-D), Federal Highway Administration, Room 4410, 400 Seventh Street, S. W., Washington, D. C. 20590.   E-mailed, faxed, and telephonically transmitted Statements of Qualifications will NOT be accepted.   It is estimated that the total value of this project ultimately will fall somewhere within the range of ten million to twenty million dollars.

USSOCOM has a two-part mission that is clear: To Plan, Direct, and Execute the Global War on Terrorism as the lead combatant command and To Train and Equip Special Operations Forces.

In support of that mission USSOCOM buys weapons, ammunition and explosives, aircraft components and accessories, ships and small crafts, engines and turbines, program support services, training support and computer maintenance and support. 

Today a Special Operations Forces (SOF) operator is better equipped than ever before because of the strong government-to-industry relationships that will continue to strengthen those relationships.

This event will result in interactions with SOF Senior Leadership and Seasoned Operators from the field; briefings on long range acquisition planning information; forums for industry to exhibit their products, services and technology;an opportunity to directly market and connect with our internal customers; and schedule one-on-one sessions with Program Executive Office (PEO) personnel.

The exhibit halls will be open to all conference attendees; USSOCOM, CENTCOM and MacDill AFB personnel as well.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Solicitation number AG-0116-S-08-0017 is being used for this solicitation.  Please reference this number on any and all communication regarding this project.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-24.  This requirement is for full and open competition under NAICS 541712, small business size standard of 500 employees.  

Contractors are responsible for reading and complying with this entire combined synopsis/solicitation and monitoring this website:  http://www.fbo.gov for any additional information relating to this requirement.  The Forest Service will not contact any vendor notifying of changes regarding this solicitation.  Submission of quotations shall be in accordance with the instructions identified in this requirement.

Contractors with the demonstrated capability and financial capacity to provide specified services in accordance with the specified delivery schedule are invited to respond to this request.

BACKGROUND:
The PNW Research Station has developed a food-based habitat evaluation system for deer habitat and the US Forest Service/Tongass National Forest wants to apply it for both planning and monitoring.  The name of the system is Forage Resource Evaluation System for Habitat or the short name FRESH-Deer.  The system has both a deer and moose application.  

Its Forage Nutrition Database is very important and needs to be verified and expanded for general use.  The PNW Research Station currently is in possession of approximately 500 freeze-dried samples of deer forages collected within an experimental design for evaluating site-specific variation in digestible protein and digestible energy.  Laboratory analysis of those samples will be a huge contribution to the Forage Nutrition Database of FRESH-Deer and of great help to the Tongass Nation Forest for routine application of FRESH-Deer.  It also will provide a test of the significance of digestible protein as a potential limiting factor for deer on the Tongass and may have major implications for reducing the amount of future effort directed at nutritional analyses.  Therefore, the Tongass National Forest has elected to contract for laboratory analyses of the freeze dried samples and their incorporation into the FRESH-Deer Database.

STATEMENT OF WORK:  

PERFORM THE FOLLOWING LABORATORY ANALYSES:
1.  Oven-dry dry matter determination
2.  Total Nitrogen (% dry matter)- See Note 1
3.  Tannin Astringency, measured by BSA precipitation (mg/mg dry matter)- See Note 2
4.  Van Soest Sequential Fiber Analysis (% NDF, ADF, ADL, & AIA dry matter)- See Note 3
5.  Gross Energy (cal/gram)- See Note 4

NOTES:
1.  Can be by Kjeldahl method or autoanalyzer or other currently accepted method.
2.  By Martin & Martin (1982.  Oecologia 54:205-211) technique or by McArt et al (2006. J Chem.Ecol. 32:1367-1377) microplate technique.
3.  By Van Soest technique as modified with sodium sulfite by Hanley et al (1992. Ecology 73:537-541).
4.  By bomb calorimeter.

NUMBER OF SAMPLES TO BE ANALYZED:
Line Item 1:  Full Analysis of (1) Oven-dry dry matter determination, (2) Total Nitrogen, (3) Tannin Astringency, (4) Van Soest Sequential Fiber Analysis and (5) Gross Energy:  Total of 453 samples.  All samples consist of equal or greater than 7.0 gram freeze-dried and ground plant material.

Line Item 2:  Partial Analysis (for calculation of digestible protein only) consisting of (1) Oven-dry dry matter determination, (2) Total Nitrogen, and (3) Tannin Astringency only:  Total of 21 samples.  All of these samples consist of great than 3.0 but less than 6.0 grams of freeze-dried and ground material.

GOVERNMENT PROVIDED SAMPLES:
All samples will be provided by the Government to the contractor approximately 15 days after notification of award and shipped to the laboratory in individually numbered, sealed plastic jars.  The Government anticipates an estimated award date by May 15, 2008.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Scope of Work<BR><BR>Purpose:	The United States Army Prime Power School (USAPPS) owns three each MP-36A, Electro-Motive Division (EMD), 1.5 MW electrical generating units. These generator s are large (approximately 43 feet = length; 11 feet = height; 10 feet width). The generators have three distinctive compartments. On the forward end is the exciter room, which houses the units static exciter, filters and other electrical components. The center compartment is the engine room, which houses a 16 cylinder diesel engine, the electrical alternator and other external auxiliary system components. The aft end is the fan room, which houses the fan shaft, the eight bladed fan, and roof top radiator sections. All three rooms are attached to a common skid. The problem is that these generators are nearing 50 years old and the fan rooms external housing (enclosure) has rusted beyond routine or patch type repair. The requested repairs will validate fan r oom structural integrity enabling school staff and students a safe work environment; removal and replacement of deteriorated compartment wall panels will inhibit water intrusion and improve exterior appearance; and application of a  protective coating (int erior) and paint (interior and exterior) will help prevent future metallurgic deterioration.<BR><BR>Description of Work Requested:	The work required by the USAPPS pertains only to the generators fan rooms and entails replacement of the right and left exte rnal wall panels; the floor panel between the fan and external fan louvers; and the front section that separates the engine room from the fan room. The structural beams along the sides and support structure along the top of the fan rooms require sand blast ing to remove rust and an inspection to insure structural integrity. In the event structural integrity has been compromised through metallurgic deterioration, work would include replacement of the faulty beams. Once wall panels have been replaced, the work  requires a protective coating designed to prevent rusting throughout the interior of the fan room. The coating will be applied on all exposed metal areas that have resulted from the sand blasting the structural support beams and replacement wall panels. T he interior fan room compartment will be prepared, primed and painted to industry standards with a matching grey paint. The external surfaces will only be prepared and primed. In order to complete this work the radiator sections located on the roof of the fan room will need to be removed and replace once the restoration work is completed. Additionally, the louver shroud on the aft end will need to be removed and replaced once the restoration work is completed. <BR><BR>Scope of Work:	<BR><BR>A.	Service contr actor will:<BR><BR>	1.	Furnish appropriately sized material handling equipment, which will be used to remove and replace the fan louver shroud from the aft end of the fan room and the radiators sections from the roof of the fan room.<BR><BR>	2.	Remove and dispose of deteriorated materials (side and floor wall panels), waste and debris.<BR><BR>	3.	Clean side and roof support beams using sand blasting to inspect metallurgic integrity, remove and replace unserviceable support beams sections; apply rust prevent ative material to support beams; prep / prime / paint support beams with grey matching paint IAW industrial standards. <BR><BR>	4.	Supply all materials, shop supplies, primer, coating material, paint, and special tools.<BR><BR>	5.	Utilize all appropriate s afety measures for prevention of accidents and supply contractor employees with proper personal protective equipment IAW OSHA safe working standards.<BR><BR>	6. 	Furnish tarps or other protective materials to cover exposed fan room interior components from the weather once exteriors walls are removed.<BR><BR>B.	The Prime Power School will:<BR><BR>	1.	Completely drain the radiator of coolant and disconnect plumbing  to separate radiator system from the engine compartment.<BR><BR>	2.	Insure all equipment is de-energized by applying lockout / tagout prior to the start of work and lifting lockout and tagout when the work is completed IAW OSHA safety standards and EM 385 -1-1.<BR><BR>	3.	Provide rest room and break area facilities for contractor personnel.<BR><BR>	 <BR>

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103.  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Q: The subject Airborne AIS solicitation states that proposals may be submitted via Fax.  Are E-Mail submissions acceptable also?
A: Yes. Emails may be sent to ginger.g.woodington@uscg.mil.

Q: The solicitation also states that FAA Certification is required.  Since AIS is not an aircraft navigation system, and is not required for flight, FAA Cert is not required - however we do have FAA Airworthiness Certificate for this equipment - is this what was meant and is it acceptable to meet this requirement?
A: FAA certification remains a requirement of this solicitation.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer potential offeror questions which were due no later than 4:00 PM Washington, D.C. local time, Wednesday, 26 March 2008, 2007.

1.	If teamed with another contractor, can their past performance be used?

ANSWER:  Yes.

2.	Can we include personal/employee past performance?

ANSWER:  No.  The services are non-personal which means that contractor employees must meet minimum qualifications to do the work required.  We?re contracting for the services, not for particular people. 

3.	Since the Technical and Management Plan is the most important evaluation factor, will the government increase the page count to 15 pages exclusive of the Cover Page and Table of Contents Resumes?  This would enable prospective contractors to more thoroughly and accurately respond to the requirements outlined in the solicitation.

ANSWER:  No.  The government expects a great deal of competition for this requirement based on the very large response to the sources sought notice.  This expectation requires the government to place reasonable limits on offerors proposals to ensure that adequate time is available for limited evaluation resources to be effectively utilized. 

4.  Are resumes excluded from the page count?

ANSWER:  Yes.  

5.	The solicitation states the contract type will be firm fixed price (Section Q) but requires hourly rate pricing.  Will the resulting contract be a Firm Fixed Price Hourly Labor Rate (time and materials) or Firm Fixed Price (based on total level of effort defined) contract?

Answer:  Firm Fixed Price (based on hours cited in the solicitation) contract.

6.	Please confirm a separate Price Proposal is required.

ANSWER:  A separate Price Proposal is required.

7.	Should the Reps and Certs be included as a separate attachment (or with the Price Proposal if required)?

ANSWER:  Include Reps and Certs as a separate attachment or certify that these have been accomplished via On line Representations and Certifications (ORCA) IAW combined synopsis/solicitation provision ?N. Participants shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS with quote?.

9.  In reference to the above solicitation I have an item that I would like some further clarification on. In regards to the 4,160 man hours that are required the first year, I assume this is for two support staff working 40 hours a week for 52 weeks. In the event that one of these staff members should become ill or request a leave of absence what is the expectations for staffing the support center? Should we have another staff member ready to step in or will short gaps in time with only one staff member be permitted?

ANSWER:  The current contractor provides one full time employee and two part time employees.  The government does not put any restriction on Potential offerors.  They are free to propose any combination of full and/or part time workers to cover the hours of service required.   How the successful contractor maintains services when their employees are sick or otherwise absent is an internal decision of the contractor?s management.  The government is contracting for the services and has a reasonable expectation that it will receive them. 

10.	 Who is the incumbent?  

ANSWER:  C2 Technologies, Inc., 1921 GALLOWS RD STE 840, VIENNA, VA 22182-3900.
 
11.  Is the incumbent qualified to bid?
 
ANSWER:  No.  
 
12.  What is the current staffing level of the NFIRS center?
 
ANSWER:  The current contractor provides one full time employee and two part time employees.
 
13. The RFP indicates the number of hours will support only two full time personnel, does this include a project or program manager or should that be quoted separately from the hours stated?

ANSWER:  The government is contracting for services.  How an offeror proposes to provide the required services is completely up to the offeror.

14.	Is an incumbent or are Government personnel currently performing this work?  If so, would you please identify? 

ANSWER: Incumbent -   C2 Technologies, Inc., 1921 GALLOWS RD STE 840, VIENNA, VA 22182-3900.

15.	If there is an incumbent, please provide any releasable contract information.  

ANSWER:  Current contract is EME-2003-CO-0184 with C2 Technologies, Inc., 1921 GALLOWS RD STE 840, VIENNA, VA 22182-3900. 

16.	 If there is an incumbent, are they eligible to participate in this solicitation? 

ANSWER:  No.  

17.	 If Government personnel are currently performing the work, is this solicitation the result of an A-76 study?

ANSWER:  Government personnel are not currently performing this work. 

18.  Since much of this work seems to lend itself well to remote performance, would the customer consider solutions that propose remote support, with site visits provided when needed, as long as this method provides advantages (e.g., cost savings) to the Government? 

ANSWER:  No.  The government requires on-site service.

19.	 Will the contractor use an existing tool for tracking NFIRS Vendor Issues, or should this be included in the bid?

ANSWER:  The government provides the necessary tools.
 

20.  Is there background information that you might be able to share with us, such as the current size of the team, budget, skills set, type of coverage, current contractor, etc.

The current contractor is C2 Technologies, Inc., 1921 GALLOWS RD STE 840, VIENNA, VA 22182-3900.  The skill set of the workers is a function of the work, which is identified in the Performance Work Statement.  The required coverage is spelled out in the Performance Work Statement. The FY 08 year budget is $375,000.00. 
  
20.	 How is the NFIRS Help Desk being supported today? 
ANSWER:  Through contract EME-2003-CO-0184 with C2 Technologies, Inc., 1921 GALLOWS RD STE 840, VIENNA, VA 22182-3900.

23.	If not, is development of an SOP part of the contract? 
ANSWER:  Development of an SOP is not part of the contract.

24.	Regarding transition planning, who is the eventual contractor to transition to at the end of the contract? 

ANSWER:  If these services are still required, they will be recompeted about six months prior to the expiration of any contract resulting from this solicitation.  It is impossible to know at this point who the new contractor, if any, will be.

25.	Regarding the statement, ?Employee benefits of the firm?, is the government intending to evaluate the benefits provided by the firm to the employee or the benefits of the employee to the government?  Please clarify. 
ANSWER:  The government intends to consider the benefits provided by the firm to the employee(s) in its evaluation.

26.	If supplied, are the key personnel resumes included as part of the 10 page limit of the Technical and Management Plan? 
ANSWER:  No.

27.	Regarding Past Performance is the 2-page limit inclusive of all three Past Performance Qualification or is it a 2-page limit per Past Performance Qualification. 
ANSWER:  The 2-page limit on Past Performance is per Past Performance.
28.	Section L, Period of Performance states for CLIN 0004 and CLIN 0005 that the associated Option Periods are respectively Option Period 1 and Option Period 2.  Should this not read Option Period 3 and Option Period 4? 
ANSWER:  Yes.  Thank you for pointing out this error.  The pertinent portion of Section L should read:  Optional Periods of Performance are in one year increments as follows: Option Period 1: June 1, 2009 through May 31, 2010 (CLIN 0002); Option Period 2: June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2011 (CLIN 0003); Option Period 3: June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012 (CLIN 0004); Option Period 4: June 1, 2012 through May 31, 2013 (CLIN 0005)

29.	Please confirm that resumes and past performance do not count against the 10pg Technical quote submission.

ANSWER:  Resumes and past performance do not count against the 10 page Technical quote submission.

30.	Would you please provide the current Contract information (Contract Number and Incumbent Vendor)? Is the current vendor Hubzone and if not, are they able to bid on this opportunity?
ANSWER:  EME-2003-CO-0184 with C2 Technologies, Inc., 1921 GALLOWS RD STE 840, VIENNA, VA 22182-3900.  C2 Tech is not a Hub Zone company and therefore is not eligible to bid on this requirement.

31.  Please explain the reason for the decline in estimated hours over the potential 60 month award (Base year: 4,160; Option Year 1: 4,000; Option Year 2; 3,845; Option Year 3: 3,695; Option year 4: 3,550).

ANSWER:  Historical data indicates a decline in the number of inquiries as users become more familiar with the NFIRS system.  The government expectation is that the services won?t be as necessary in the out years, because the number of questions is anticipated to continue to decline, thereby making the action of reducing hours reasonable.  Funding for the NFIRS program may be constrained as well, going forward.   These considerations resulted in the hours quoted in the solicitation.  

32.	Emmitsburg, MD, 21727 is not listed as an SBA Hubzone area. Will vendors be prohibited from proposing personnel (and if the need arises in the future) replacing personnel that live outside of a Hubzone, such as Emmitsburg? Or is the compliance requirement that the proposing vendor be an SBA Hubzone, with a small business size standard for $23M?

ANSWER:  The compliance requirement is that the proposing vendor be an SBA Hubzone, and a small business with a small business size standard for $23M for the NAICS code being solicited.  NAICS code is:  541513.


33.	Is the reason that there is a decline in the hours each year economically motivated or is it due to less hours required due to reduction in work effort?

ANSWER:  See answer to Question 31 above.
 
34.  Paragraph O - Evaluation Factors: 18th line - submit a staffing plan for achieving the SOO.  What is SOO?  Statement of Objective?  Is this same as Statement of Work?

ANSWER:  SOO is a Statement of Objectives.  It is not the same as a Statement of Work.  A SOO is part of a performance based Acquisition whereby the government relies on the contractor?s expertise to propose a methodology to fulfill a requirement.  A SOW is not usually performance based and normally spells out in some detail how the government wants work accomplished.
 
34.	Do the required resume pages count against the 10 page technical submission?  If not is there a limit to the number of pages for resumes?

ANSWER:  Resume pages do not count against the 10 page technical submission.
 
36.  We note that there are 22,000 fire departments that report an average of 14 million incidents and 1 million fires each year; can the government provide call volume statistics in terms of average calls per day, most frequent type of calls, or the average time to respond to an inquiry?

ANSWER:  Last year we received 1,685 inquiries via telephone, fax, and email. The most common questions involved general questions about the NFIRS program and how to participate, followed by questions about the reporting tool. We do not have estimates on the average response time per inquiry.
 
37.  We are working on the proposal response and I wanted to clarify format for the pricing section.  It states that the award is anticipated to be Firm Fixed Price.  It also states the proposal must reflect hourly rate, hours, and extended price for each labor category for the base and option years.  

Should we be providing a total FFP at the end of the pricing section showing a total bid amount or are you looking for a simpler format?

ANSWER:  Provide a total overall price at the end of the detailed pricing section.      

38.  "To comply with the requirements HSAR Clause 3052.204-71, and Department policy, the contractor must complete the following forms for applicable personnel who will be performing work under this contract as indicated:       

a. Standard Form (SF) 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions. b. FD-258 fingerprint cards.  c. DHS Form 11000-6, Conditional Access to Sensitive But Unclassified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement. Required of all applicable contractor personnel. d. DHS Form 11000-9, Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)."
  
Question:  Are all of these forms required for purposes of the proposal response or can they be provided post award for key personnel?

ANSWER:  The successful offeror will have to provide these forms after award but prior to any employee beginning work at the government facility.  These forms are NOT required for the proposal.
 
39.	I was hoping to clarify the required delivery method for the "NFIRS Help Desk" solicitation proposal responses due April 7th.  It states email version and hard copies in separate areas.  Is an (email) electronic version acceptable for purposes of the response or is a hard copy required as well? 

ANSWER:   An (email) electronic version is acceptable.  We recommend all offerors follow up with a hard copy which need be dated on or before 7 April 2008, to ensure that a proposal is received.  The government does not take responsibility for corrupt data files, files which cannot be opened using standard MS Office 2003 applications, nor for omissions/failures/mistakes caused by or attributable to any hardware/software malfunctions.  

40.	Had a quick question in reference to solicitation HSFEEM-08-Q-0024. Is this existing requirement or new requirement? 

ANSWER:  It is an existing requirement.

42.  We are working on writing a proposal for you and would like to know if you have any  clarification on total number of staff.

ANSWER:  This is a Performance Based Contracting action, which means that the government leaves it to the discretion of the offeror(s) to propose the appropriate labor categories and number of workers to accomplish the work described in the Performance Work Statement.

43.  I was hoping to obtain an additional clarification.  It states the following in the solicitation regarding personnel clearance:

"To comply with the requirements HSAR Clause 3052.204-71, and Department policy, the contractor must complete the following forms for applicable personnel who will be performing work under this contract as indicated:

a. Standard Form (SF) 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions. b.
FD-258 fingerprint cards.  c. DHS Form 11000-6, Conditional Access to Sensitive But Unclassified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement.
Required of all applicable contractor personnel. d. DHS Form 11000-9, Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)."
  
Question:  Are all of these forms required for purposes of the proposal response or can they be provided post award for key personnel?  

ANSWER:  They can be provided post award.  They are NOT required with the proposal.

 44.  What is the current COT or technology that is utilized for issue tracking and updating of incidents?

ANSWER:  We have a database application that was developed for tracking inquiries. The contractor will not be required to modify or maintain the database application and it will be accessed through computers that we provide.  The successful offeror will not have to supply hardware and they don't have to maintain the software.

Background 

The National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST)Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) is a large laboratory facility consisting of a suite of instruments that measure the interaction of radiation with various materials to study their structure and properties.  The NCNR maintains a wide variety of instruments that allows great flexibility in the type of samples and phenomena that can be studied and measured.  Because of continually emerging technology and measurement applications, concepts and opportunities for new instrumentation and upgrades to existing instrumentation continually arise.  To maintain the current position of the NCNR as a world leader in neutron scattering facilities, the NCNR employs a staff of scientists and engineers whose purpose is to carry out projects for new instrumentation or enhancements to existing instrumentation.

The NCNR operates as a national user facility and the majority of research performed here is conducted by external users that are granted instrument time through a proposal review and selection process.  Currently, the NCNR cannot meet the demand rate for instrument time and many potentially important and valuable experiments must be rejected or postponed.  As neutron scattering gains recognition as a powerful research tool for advancing U.S. technological expertise, the gap between demand and availability will only widen.  In response to this situation, the NCNR has recently engaged in an expansion to its research facility.  The expansion will add five new cold neutron beams and a suite of five new instruments operating in a new guide hall adjacent to our present cold neutron guide hall. 

To supply the engineering resources required for the facility expansion in addition to completing the projects that the NCNR is currently engaged in will require enhancing the current engineering staff.  A resource analysis has identified the need for a minimum of one mid- to senior level mechanical design engineer that, in addition to performing engineering design tasks, is capable of independently leading an instrument development team and coordinating contract acquisitions with the Technical Information Contact (TIC).  Finding possible candidates with the required qualifications and experience has been difficult and this requirement is for procuring the services of a recruitment agency to supplement ongoing NCNR recruitment efforts by locating, screening, and performing reference checks on a pool of possible candidates and providing the NCNR a list of candidates meeting the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) qualification requirements for the GS-830 Mechanical Engineering Series.  Candidates will be directed to the Government websites for Professional Engineering positions and systems for participation in the competitive service procedure.  

Description of Requirement 

Contractor support is required to locate and identify qualified candidates for inclusion in the selection process for federal employment, specifically related to a vacancy posted by the NIST/NCNR or the Direct Hire system.  The process may vary, but might include advertising, personnel database searching, web posting, resume screenings, interviews, and reference checks.  The final deliverable will be a package containing a list of bona fide candidates that meet the minimum job requirements.  This package will contain all materials used to screen these candidates (resumes, reference check documentation, interview notes, etc.) as well as current contact information for the candidates.  Individuals on this list will be directed by the Government to the Government websites where they can register for consideration in the normal competitive selection process for federal employment.
