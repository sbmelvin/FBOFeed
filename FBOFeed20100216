The requirements will be:	Pagan	May - Enough for 20 people		June - Enough for 40 people		July - Enough for 40 people		August - Enough for 15 peopleThe 4 remaining islands will need to have enough food to support 10 people each month (May-August).* These numbers can slide either way as schedules are still tentative, but are a starting point for food estimation.
3.  Place/Delivery and Period of Performance:  Saipan will act as the staging area and transportation hub for travel to the Northern Islands. Contractor will be responsible for getting their people to Saipan.  FWS will be responsible for taking all members of the contract and their food to the camp locations by boat, barge and/or helicopter. The locations of these camps are in the CNMI.

(Smaller camps may draw down sooner depending on biologists completing their surveys)
4.  Inspection and Acceptance:  Fully supplied camps are designed to keep biologists focused on their respective projects, increase safety by eliminating some of the hazards, and generally improve the quality and quantity of survey time on the island. Camps will need to be maintained adequately to insure the health of the biologists (food preparation, sanitization).  Camp managers will have all food supplies necessary, and are responsible for coordination of re-supply with boat and helicopter schedules. Maintain daily communication with main camp manager as well as with project leadership giving accurate and timely status reports.  
5.  Government Furnished Equipment or Materials/Information:  The project leader for this mission is Curt Kessler.  All instructions, information and guidance will be coming from him or his designated back-up.  USFWS will provide:  water, fuel, solar or generator power source, refrigeration, tents, sundries, cooking utensils, transportation, satellite phones, and other miscellaneous camp supplies (not including food).
6.  Availability/Location: Three of the islands have small village areas with 1-10 residents and have no to minimal infrastructure.  Some of these islands have only been rarely visited by biologists and are relatively unknown.  To the greatest extent possible, those residents that live on a particular island (Alamagan, Pagan, Agrihan) will be used in a support role capacity. A grant has been set-up with the Northern Islands Mayors Office (NIMO) to provide salary to these personnel as employees of NIMO.  Due to rugged terrain, some islands will have more than one camp or supply caches.     The islands of Pagan and Alamagan have volcanoes that are smoking.  An evacuation plan will be written and it will be the responsibility of camp managers to be familiar with the plan, be a focal point for emergency response and know how to implement evacuation.

<DESC>Recovery - This notice is provided for information purposes only. NASA LaRC intendsto issue a Task Order to ATK Space Systems, Inc. against the IDIQ contract entitledTechnology, AirSTAR Testbed Development and Support. The NASA Airborne Subscale TransportAircraft Research (AirSTAR) facility includes a suite of complex subscale flight vehiclesystems and a suite ofcomplex hardware and software systems in its Mobile Operations Station (MOS). Thesesystems  were designed to conduct research through both simulation and flight test ofsubscale remotelypiloted aircraft. The purpose of the research is to advance the state of the art oftechnologies (e.g. flight control theories) that can be used to reduce the number ofairplane accidents fatalities due to loss of control or other related adverse conditions.This purpose aligns with the goals of the NASAAviation Safety Programs Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) and IntegratedResilient Aircraft Control (IRAC) projects. The AirSTAR system will enable flightexperiments on remotely piloted vehicles to explore off-nominal portions of the flightenvelope that are associated with loss of control (LOC) incidents and damage conditions.Such an experimental capability is critical to the design and testing of controlalgorithms that can mitigate damage and recover from upset conditions,as well as other LOC precursors. The vehicles range from commercially available radiocontrol models to custom built and dynamically scaled models of full-scale aircraft. Thesimpler models represent generic flight characteristics and allow for parametric testingover a range of conditions. The dynamically scaled models represent specific flightcharacteristics of full-scale aircraft and have application in validating technologiesfor these vehicles. The Contractor shall perform tasks toprepare aircraft for flight operations in accordance with the attached deploymentschedule. The tasks include mechanical design, loads analysis, airframe modifications,assembly, fabrication, integration, systems and component testing (e.g. updates topropulsive system, control surface servos, landinggear, inertias, etc.). This effort will be funded by ARRA funding and is in support ofthe NASA Aeronautics Research Directorate Aviation Safety Program. This announcement willnot result in a Request for Proposal; this announcement is for informational purposesonly.An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".

It shall be self-contained, diesel engine driven, electrical power unit on a ruggedized four wheel trailer capable of being towed over paved and gravel surfaces.  The MEPP shall utilize state-of-the-art displays and instrumentation technologies for both engine operations and generator outputs.  As required for any typical Navy support equipment, the MEPP shall be highly reliable, maintainable, and supportable.  As a land-based unit, it shall be capable of meeting shock, vibration, environmental, EMI and mobility criteria.   The MEPP shall generate electric power outputs as follows:  115 VAC, 400 HZ, 28 VDC and 270 VDC output. The diesel powered generator unit shall adhere to the requirements of MIL-STD-704F (at a minimum) for aircraft power characteristics and EPA Emission Standards (Tier 3).  The unit shall be equipped with internally stored output power cables.  The output cables shall connect to all existing Navy and Marine Corp aircraft. The new MEPP shall adhere to national standards as documented in SAE AS8090, utilize state-of-the-art technology, and be transportable in military aircraft(C-5, C-17, C-130, and H-53).

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest (NAVFAC SW) is establishing a Southern California and Arizona 8(a) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) and a Northern California and Nevada 8(a) BOA. This solicitation is for the Northern CA & Nevada BOA only. NAVFAC SW is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) "Developmental Stage" (first four years of the 8(a) program) construction firms with a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (Fresno, Sacramento, San Francisco, CA; and Las Vegas, NV) to participate in this BOA program. The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs.  The BOA is a five-year (base and 4 one-year options) program in coordination with the Small Business Administration for Developmental Stage 8(a) firms. The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) Developmental Stage construction firms that are located in one of the four specified SBA Districts. The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement. Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract. Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed. If adequate competition cannot be obtained within the designated SBA District, the Government, upon SBA concurrence, reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent districts. The anticipated types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines), and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items). Only NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and 238 pertain to this BOA. Each firm will identify their primary NAICS code and a secondary NAICS code (if applicable). There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement; however, there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,500,000 per firm, per year. Any unused capacity in one year will not be carried over to the subsequent years. Individual task orders will range between $2,000 and $1,000,000. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety Letter (as applicable) with each proposal over $30,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each order. Annually the Navy and the SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of a) usefulness and need for service and b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program through the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov) for new entrants once a year for each region. Task orders will not be advertised. Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly. No new orders will be issued to the Contractor and this agreement will terminate. Termination of the BOA under these circumstances shall have no effect on any orders previously issued. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification. This agreement may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation. Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the Navy may continue to place orders under the BOA. Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA. Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either eligible or ineligible. To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm must meet all the following criteria: (1) Be a certified 8(a) Developmental Stage participant (Joint Venture/Mentor Protg firms are not allowed) prior to the submission date of April 16, 2010; have a bona fide place of business in one of four SB! A Districts (Fresno, Sacramento, San Francisco, CA; and Las Vegas, NV); (2) Be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov/, including the new SBA Dynamic Small Business Listing; Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov/; and VETS-100 at https://vets100.vets.dol.gov/ (if not applicable, provide a statement that the firm has not had contracts subject to this requirement); (3) Be licensed/bonded and fully capable to perform construction work within a range of $2,000 - $1,000,000; and (4) Demonstrate technical experience/past performance (including safety) of similar size, general scope, and complexity of construction project(s) under NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and/or 238 within the last three years.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 51   Request for Information (RFI)

DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTED
The purpose of this Request for Information is to gather industry input on determining whether or not the goals for the Superfund Contracts 2000 acquisition strategy were met and to gather industry comments and/or suggestions on improving the Superfund Contracts 2010 acquisition strategy. 
BACKGROUND
The Superfund Contracts 2000 acquisition strategy was spearheaded by a cross-agency workgroup consisting of representatives from EPA's Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM), Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) and the EPA Regions. The overall mission of the workgroup was to develop an acquisition strategy and implementation plan for the Superfund program, while executing best procurement practices for all of the National Classes of Contracts.
The goals of the Contracts 2000 strategy were to: (1) increase competition, (2) retain regional flexibility, (3) increase the use of socio-economic firms' participation, and (4) to incorporate new acquisition ideas such as performance based contracting in all of the National Classes of Contracts. The Government's intention for the proposed Contracts 2010 Superfund acquisition strategy is to maintain the goals of the existing Contracts 2000 strategy while addressing government-wide contracting initiatives, improving socioeconomic participation, address and encourage green remediation procurements and increase the vendor base.  
For your convenience, all of the National Classes of Contracts Statement of Work have been included in the following website.  http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm#solam
The National Classes of Contracts are as follows:
1.	Environmental Services Assistance Team (ESAT)2.	Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team (START)3.	Emergency and Rapid Response Services (ERRS)4.	Remedial Oversight Contracts (ROC)5.	Remedial Action Contracts (RAC)6.	Enforcement Support Services (ESS)
**Please note that the Statements of Work for the National Classes of Contracts are generally consistent across the EPA regions.  However, in some instances, each Region may make parts of the Statement of Work specific to their own Region 




WHAT SHOULD BE PROVIDED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI
Responders to this RFI are asked to provide comments and/or suggestions on how the Government can improve the existing overall goals initially submitted in the Contracts 2000 Strategy.  Please limit your responses to five (5) single-sided typed pages or less. Information should be as succinct as possible.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>RECOVERY:  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTERS 2009 TASK ORDER CONTRACTORS.

The purpose of this contract is to carry out a sequence of related activities with the goal of understanding security risks to Health Information Technology, planning and executing risk mitigation strategies, testing certain risk mitigation strategies, communicating to stakeholders the results, lessons learned, and actions that can be taken to reduce risk in HIT, which will create the foundation for policy development.

On February 17, 2009, the President signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). This statute includes The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (the HITECH Act) that sets forth a plan for advancing the appropriate use of health information technology to improve quality of care and establish a foundation for health care reform. Foundational to this advancement is the assurance of safety and security in Health Information Technology, as established in the legislation’s priority areas. These include promoting security and accuracy of health information and the protection of privacy through data segmentation and prevention of unauthorized access.
Information protection and cybersecurity in the healthcare sector also cut across two of the 18 Critical Infrastructure sectors (information systems and health care) under the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. As noted in the President’s proclamation of December 2009 as Critical Infrastructure Protection Month, “critical infrastructure are the assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, public health or safety.”

Cybersecurity has been identified as a top strategic priority, as set out in the White House report: “Cyberspace Policy Review” (May, 2009). As health information exchange between enterprises increases, protecting it in its transit across cyberspace becomes increasingly important. Assuring the protection of health information stored electronically, wherever it may be located, also requires securing it against threats originating in cyberspace. The White House report identified 10 short-term top priorities for cybersecurity, including strategic planning, interagency cybersecurity policy cooperation, increasing public awareness, incident response, research and development, and identity management. The work plan associated with this contract will address these priorities in their relationship to HIT.

Overview of Security/Cybersecurity Fully deploying Electronic Health Records (EHRs) nationwide and increasing health information exchange, as required under the 	ARRA/HITECH legislation, steps up the need to protect these strategic information resources against cybersecurity threats. ONC has developed a coordinated plan to identify and address these threats and lay the groundwork for a safe and secure HIT ecosystem for the United States. This plan includes several distinct and related phases, each of which is composed of one or more specific activities.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN SERVICES - REFIT OF THE RESEARCH VESSEL STICKLEBACK.  The Stickleback is a former US Coast Guard Patrol/Rescue boat.  For the USGS, it is used as a Fisheries Research Vessel capable of trawling, gillnetting, overboard instrument sampling and hydroacoustic sampling.  It is located at the marina in Washburn, WI.
Aboard the Stickleback, deck equipment has already been installed, including a trawl net reel, roller, winches, gallows, gillnet lifter, instrument winch and sorting table.  The existing Cummins 903 engines, designed for speed, are fuel inefficient and are at the end of their service life.  They are also very large, making installation of hydraulics and electrical systems impossible in the engine compartment.  It is intended that these engines be replaced with smaller, fuel efficient engines that will allow space in the engine compartment for the hydraulic system and a ship's service electrical generator.  Stability calculations will also need to be done to ensure proper stability with the new mechanical equipment..  The specific design requirements will include the following:  1) determine performance specifications and recommend type/brand/model of a hydraulic system and generator; 2) design lake water wash down system with sufficient flow and pressure to be determined with consultation with LSBS personnel; 3) design navigation lights to show Restricted Maneuverability; 4) design canopy system for deck fish processing area; 5) design hoist system for A-frame; 6) design a sonar tube deployment system for hydro-acoustic and searchlight sonar equipment; 7) calculate stability data; and 8) design the installation of all items.
Design must satisfy the following performance requirements for the vessel:  1) transit cruising speed of 18-20 knots; 2) trawling speed to be determined with consultation between LSBS personnel and ship architect/marine engineer; and 3) electrical capacity to support hydraulics, ship's service including ROV (120V 650-1000W), 3 personal computers, refrigerator, microwave, and other small appliances.
This notice is an invitation for all eligible A&E firms who have the qualifications required to perform the work to submit a completed SF 330.  The associated solicitation number is 10ERSS0045.  Responses are due on Tuesday, 03/02/2010 at 2:00 pm CST. 
This requirement is being issued as set aside for small business competition.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330. The associated small business size standard is $18.5M. There is not an incumbent contractor.  
All A&E firms responding to this announcement shall submit a completed SF 330.  Please provide the following additional information on the form: Tax Identification Number (TIN) and DUNS number. All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).

<p>This procurement will be conducted under NAICS Code: 236118; The small business size standard for this NAICS Code (i.e Residential Remodelers) is $33.5MM<br />Type of Acquisition: Total small business set aside</p>
<p>Acquisition Method: Invitation for Bids</p>
<p>Award Determination: This award will be made to the lowest-priced, responsive, responsible small business firm</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available on or about March 2 2010 for viewing / downloading documents.</p>
<p>JOB Description: <br />The job site is located at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Coyote Valley Dam / Lake Mendocino Project Headquarters, approximately 5 miles north of the city of Ukiah (1160 Lake Mendocino Drive, Ukiah, California, 95482) and 3 miles from State Highway 101.</p>
<p>Proposed work consists of furnishing all labor, materials, and equipment to renovate Building #2, upgrading it from its present state to a multi-purpose office. Building #2 shall be renovated to include a Conference Room, Kitchen, Dining Area, Filing Storage Room and Men's &amp; Women's Restrooms. The Government has already purchased some necessary materials for the project's completion. The Contractor shall verify the govt-supplied materials and furnish the remaining necessary materials to perform this project.</p>
<p><br />Building # 2 was originally constructed to serve as a concrete and soils testing laboratory, as well as a survey office, during the construction of Coyote Valley Dam (CVD) and appurtenances. Following completion of the dam in the late 1950's, the building was converted into a wood shop and storage facility. The wood-framed single-story structure has a total floor area of approximately 2,850 feet. Floors are concrete slab type, ceilings are vaulted, and interior walls are generally covered with sheetrock or plywood, if not exposed to studs. The roof is covered with composition type rolled roofing overlaying plywood sheeting, purlins and insulating fiberboard. Currently, Building # 2 is used as an alternate make-shift conference area, as well as exercise and storage facility. The Project's main building (Building 1) houses the main conference room (also serves as lunch room) which is extremely undersized. Building #2 contains women's and men's restrooms which are in various stages of renovation. In 2009, project staff remodeled approximately 368 feet of floor space to construct a new exercise room. Hence, this area shall not be included in the new proposed work.</p>

<DESC>SynopsisThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), Eatontown, NJ 07724, intends to procure software development services under full and open competition (no set-aside used) to extend two pre-existing software applications known as "StandingSentry" and "AutoOrder" through collaborative agile development.  StandingSentry is intended to provide an interface to capture lab results suspicious for malignancy that need the special attention of the provider(s).  StandingSentry shall access radiological and lab test reports, consult and other clinic notes; it shall detect patients with radiological exams and studies, specialty consults or lab results suspicious for malignancy by retrieving test results appropriately flagged in laboratory and radiological databases periodically on a fairly frequent basis (referred to as "index study" in this document); it  shall enable automatic ordering of lab tests, radiological studies and consults; it shall interface with appointment schedules to activate and resolve clinical reminders; and it shall maintain a VistA FileMan database of patient demographics and the critical path taken for orders evaluated.  The purpose of StandingSentry is to enable oversight and redundancy making the evaluation of the index study failsafe.  It shall also enable evaluation of the cycle time from definitive diagnosis to treatment and process improvement efforts aimed at reducing failures and cycle times thus ensuring timely and appropriate treatment.AutoOrder is intended for health maintenance built upon the existing reminder system and used to automatically order lab tests and inform the patient that these orders need to be done by the patient.   AutoOrder relies on the reminder system patient reports which are generally run once every week.  AutoOrder shall perform the following: enable access to and evaluation of radiology and lab reports, orders, and future and past appointments anywhere in VANCHCS with any service; identify those patients who need clinical reminders, or are past due for routine interventions to manage their chronic conditions; activate clinical reminder reports through VistA; enable patient contact through automatic telephone calls in their physician or provider's own voice, and allow for Secure Messaging and the Postcard system; maintain a list of those patients using co managed care orders; enable contact with those patients' outside physician or provider's office; and ensure coordinated medical care.The solicitation will be issued as a request for quote (RFQ) from the VA TAC, and the number assigned to it will be VA118-10-RQ-0030. The associated NAICS code for this effort is 541511.  The proposed action is for a six month, Firm-Fixed Price type contract.  The place of performance shall be at the contractor's facility.  All proposal documents and communications shall be made available through the Contract Specialist, Mark Junda, via email at mark.junda@va.gov, or via telephone at 732.578.5428.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />Hydraulic System Auxiliary Pump (Left and Right) Upgrade to KC-135R/T/OC-B (419 aircraft in total).
<p>PURPOSE<br />The 827th Aircraft Sustainment Group Contracting Office (827 ACSG/PK), Tinker AFB OK, is conducting market research to determine estimated cost of developing and installing a Hydraulic System Auxiliary Pump (Left and Right) Upgrade to meet all of the requirements in table 1. This solution should address meeting requirements in table 1 and should not be limited to replacement of both the left and right pumps. The optimal solution would provide an independent, onboard method of supplying hydraulic fluid with appropriate pressure/capacity to both the left and right hydraulic systems during ground operations. The hydraulic pump solution should be capable of accepting DC power for the purpose of charging the brake system for aircraft movement.<br /><br />DESCRIPTION<br />The KC-135 R/T/OC-B hydraulic system consists of four engine driven hydraulic pumps (NSN 4320-01-242-5153HS/PN PV3-205-39), one on each engine, that provide 3000 PSI to two separate hydraulic systems at 22.5 gallons per minute (GPM) flow. In addition, there are two auxiliary pumps (NSN 3010-00-5675873RK/PN DO81 (DC Motor), 4320-00-864-8677HS/PN PF24-3906-24ZH4 [Right Hand Pump], NSN 4320-00-768-6345HS/PN 65W01020 [Left Hand Pump]) both rated at 0.76 GPM flow. However, the 0.76 GPM flow from the current auxiliary pumps does not allow proper flow to support testing of all hydraulic systems. To facilitate ground testing, maintainers are required to run engines/or use the MJ-2A hydraulic test stand and the A/M 32A-86 electric cart. Requiring maintainers to run engines and/or test equipment is time consuming and costly to the Government. Providing an independent, onboard method of supplying hydraulic fluid with appropriate pressure/capacity to both the left and right hydraulic systems would alleviate the burden of maintenance activities (use of hydraulic test stand) which would result in a manpower savings, avoid engine runs for pre-flight checks that would result in fuel saving, and increase aircraft availability to support the warfighter.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking a Government off the shelf or commercial off the shelf solution that provides capability to sustain continuous operation of all hydraulic systems on the aircraft without use of external support equipment and engines. If these requirements cannot be met, please provide the systems that cannot be supported by the proposed solution.</p>
<p>RESPONSE<br />Responses shall address:<br />1. Developmental schedule (duration from contract award to on aircraft testing completion)<br />2. Estimated developmental cost (including nonrecurring engineering and technical data<br />3. Estimated A kit (items normally necessary to modify A/C) and B kit (end items such as line replaceable units) production cost broken down by system<br />4. Estimated installation cost with installation hours (broken down by system)<br />5. The components/methods proposed to be replaced or modified<br />6. The expected reliability maintainability &amp; availability (RMA) improvement of replacement components<br />7. Reduction of total ownership cost<br />8. The basis for this expected improvement (for example, from analysis or demonstrated performance)<br />9. Details of proposed replacement components/methods to include, but not limited to, items such as electrical, hydraulic power system requirements, airworthiness certifications actions completed, current usage on other systems or in development, logistics support requirements/availability (parts supply, spares, repair, support equipment, tech data, etc.)<br />10. The Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimated costs for nonrecurring engineering, kits, and installation. Include estimated delivery schedule and product availability<br />11. Component lead times (longest lead time only for each system is required)<br />12. Maximum aircraft modified per year</p>

<DESC>(U) Request for Information (RFI) on the Current State of Radar Data Processing Algorithms for the Tactical Radar Exploitation Toolkit<BR><BR>(U) THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.<BR><BR>(U) The Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) is seeking information on the current state of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) sensor processing algorithms.<BR><BR>(U) The current problem that plagues the analyst community is that individual sensor packages are being developed in conjunction with exploitation stations that are specific to the sensor.  Algorithms developed for one sensor may be able to benefit another yet they are often not shared.  This current sensor specific exploitation station design makes analyzing data across multiple sensors an unwieldy task.<BR><BR>(U//FOUO) I2WD intends to acquire and/or develop the Tactical Radar Exploitation (TREX) Toolkit, a framework for a suite of automated sensor processing software, to aid in the exploitation of data from SAR and GMTI systems.  The objective of the TREX Toolkit is to provide a plug and play interface to a multitude of radar data and exploitation algorithms.  The algorithms will be implemented as interchangeable modules that can be swapped within the processing chain.  The framework will provide a means to create adapters to allow data, generated by varying sensors, to be easy ingested for display in a common format.  As part of this effort, I2WD will study TREX performance in order to determine whether results from a single algorithm are sufficient for the given task or if further information can be obtained by using a family of algorithms.<BR><BR>(U//FOUO) Respondents are requested to provide a summary algorithms used to exploit SAR and/or GMTI data including, but not limited to:<BR>Image analysis<BR>Change detection<BR>Automatic feature detection<BR>Aided target detection, classification and/or recognition<BR>Tracking/Trackers (traffic patterns or human tracking)<BR>People and wildlife discrimination<BR>Pattern recognition<BR><BR>(U//FOUO) Please consider providing some of the following information about the algorithm(s):<BR>Type of data used for ingestion, for example: raw, standardized, proprietary, etc.<BR>Type of output data generated<BR>Applicable frequency range (i.e. more applicable to low and/or high frequency systems)<BR>Required hardware or processing power needed<BR>Potential for standardizing input/output<BR>Potential for modularization<BR>Maturity<BR><BR>(U) Finally, respondents should provide information regarding any underlying software technology, middleware, and/or framework architecture that the algorithm(s) utilizes, requires or is compatible with (i.e. Matlab, Labview, Java, JBOSS, JMS, .NET, etc&).  <BR><BR>(U) The government does not intend to pay for this information.  Responses are to be received by COB, 8 March 2010. All information must be in writing or via e-mail.  There is a 5MB email limit. You may forward responses to US Army, RDECOM, CERDEC, I2WD, Bldg. 600, Fort Monmouth, NJ, 07703, ATTN: RDER-IWR-RA (Mr. Lamanna) or the following e-mail address:  peter.lamanna@us.army.mil.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  If you choose to submit proprietary information, mark it accordingly.  Classified information will be accepted by mail only, but please mark it accordingly and send it via proper channels.  Classified information can be sent to US Army, RDECOM, CERDEC, I2WD, Bldg. 600, Fort Monmouth, NJ, 07703, ATTN: Security Office.  The inner wrapping shall be addressed to: ATTN: RDER-IWR-RA (Mr. Lamanna).  Questions regarding this information request can be directed to Mr. Lamanna VIA EMAIL ONLY.<BR>

<RESPDATE>022610
<CONTACT>Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a high-resolution Raman spectrometer/microscope. It will be employed to perform thermometry and investigate a wide range of materials and nanostructures in three modes: (1) as a stand-alone instrument/confocal microscope, (2) via integration with an existing atomic force microscope, and (3) using a fiber optic port for remote sensing. High-resolution spectral analysis and mapping will be required. Multiple laser lines in the near infrared (NIR), visible and ultraviolet (UV) spectrum are also required. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a Raman spectrometer/microscope that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.


NIST has a need for a Raman spectrometer/microscope that would meet the following requirements:

Spectrometer:
•	The spectrometer shall include laser lines at or close to each of the following wavelengths: 244 nm, 364 nm, 475 nm, 532 nm, 633 nm, and 785 nm.
•	Shall consist of mirror-based optics suitable for use of laser lines ranging from the UV to the NIR.
•	Shall have a total focal length of 1.5-2.5 meters.
•	Shall include gratings suitable for the laser lines included and for achieving the maximum spectral resolution for each line.
•	Shall be capable of introducing a calibration line (e.g., a Hg line) into the spectra in all three modes.
•	Shall include one or multiple detectors (CCD, photomultiplier, or other) providing highest available detection efficiency and spectral resolution at each of the specified laser lines. 
•	The vendor must supply noise specifications (dark noise, readout noise, etc) and detection efficiency vs. wavelength curves for the detector(s).
•	Must supply dispersion vs. wavelength data for the focal length/grating combination for each laser line requested.

Integration with existing AFM:
•	The spectrometer optics shall be compatible with integration into an existing AFM, i.e. supply a collimated beam (UV, visible, NIR) on an exit port. The collimated beam at the exit port will be about 12 mm in diameter.  The exit port must be at a particular height (approximately 400 mm, with the exact value to be determined) and at a location up to 500 mm from the spectrometer. The beam shall be shielded on the path to the exit port. The Raman vendor is not expected to provide/perform mechanical or optical integration beyond this exit port.
•	The control electronics shall have the capacity to communicate with an external device (1) that would provide triggers to the spectrometer for initiating spectral sweeps and (2) to which the spectrometer would provide a signal at the conclusion of each spectral sweep (as in a point-by-point map performed in coordination with an AFM topographic scan). This trigger is preferably in the form of a TTL pulse, but alternatively may be in the form of an RS232 communication protocol with an open SDK to be provided by the Raman vendor.
•	The control electronics/software should also be capable of varying spectral scan parameters (e.g. laser power) based on the trigger signal provided by the external device.

Remote sensing:
•	The spectrometer shall include a fiber optic port for performing remote sensing in the visible and NIR wavelengths.
•	Shall include a remote sensing unit for visible and NIR wavelengths.
•	Shall be capable of introducing a calibration line when remote sensing is used.

Microscope:
•	The microscope shall include one or multiple objectives suitable for all laser lines included (UV, visible, NIR). Objectives with long working distances (greater than 10 mm) with the highest available NA are of particular interest.
•	Shall be capable of mapping spectra point-by-point over a spatial range of 10-100 mm in x and y (i.e., the axes defining the sample surface plane) with a step size of approximately 100 nm.
•	Shall have confocal capability.

Control software:
•	Shall be fully integrated and capable of controlling the functions of the spectrometer, microscope, lasers, and detectors in a user-friendly fashion.

Data analysis software:
•	Shall include quantitative data analysis software using the most common data analysis algorithms. 
•	Shall be user-programmable.


NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company’s size classification in any response to this notice.  

Companies that manufacture such systems are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this Sources Sought Notice. The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this Sources Sought notice: 
1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. 
2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 
3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 
4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to todd.hill@nist.gov is currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 
5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY (NIST) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to assist the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in seeking market research information the availability of large and small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) under NAICS code, 813910, that have the capability, experience, and expert knowledge of  providing the services described herein. The Government The purpose of this nature of this work is to provide support to the NIST, BFRL to provide concrete batching , casting and testing.  The information requested by this announcement will be used within NIST to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency.  This is not a Request for Proposals.  No Solicitation is currently available, and no unsolicited proposals will be entertained as a result of this notice.  

NIST has a requirement for project performance of fourteen months.  The  NIST Inorganic Materials Group (IMG) within the Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL) is leading a project to double the service life of concrete through the development of a new chemical admixture technology developed by members of the IMG.  Because this objective has the potential to impact nearly all concrete used in critical infrastructure applications, the project objectives have become a high priority within BFRL.  The project has successfully developed a U.S. patent application and is now in the process of performing trials in concrete mixtures.  Industrial acceptance of this new technology depends critically on the appearance of objectivity and neutrality in the development and execution of the project. The volume of concrete required for each mix is greater than the capacity available at NIST laboratories.  

Objective: The Inorganic Materials Group (IMG) within the Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL) seeks to have eight (8) concrete mixtures formulated, mixed, cast into 20 (4”x8”) cylinders, and cured in a fog room.  In addition, the following tests, services, and materials for each concrete mixture are required:
•	Compressive Strength: 28 d, 56 d, and 365 d of age 
•	Rapid Migration Test: 56 d, and 365 d
•	Cut 9 cylinders in half: 56 d –
•	Chloride Profiling Measurement: After 6 m and 12 m exposure to chloride solution

Mixture Designs:

In the context of testing the VERDiCT technology under typical industrial conditions, the NIST requires contractor support to formulate eight (8) mixtures: four (4) mixtures containing at least 25 % (mass) replacement of cement by fly ash, and four (4) mixtures containing at least 40 % (mass) replacement of cement by blast furnace slag.  The volume fraction of all aggregates shall be a constant for all mixtures.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>Background. The World Health Organization (WHO) is now revising the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, currently in its 10th version (ICD-10) (WHO, 1992). WHO's Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse (MSD) has responsibility for the revision of two chapters of the ICD-10: Chapter V, Mental and Behaivoural Disorders, and Chapter VI, Diseases of the Nervous System. While the overall ICD is scheduled for approval by the World Health Assembly in 2014, MSD also envisions important intermediate products such as a clinically useful system for identification of people in need of mental health services in primary care settings, particularly in low and middle income countries.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is seeking information on small businesses organizations capable of a developing a clinically useful classification system of mental disorders to identify people in need of mental health services in primary care settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.</p>
<p>One goal of this initiative will be to consider whether correspondence can be created between a clinically useful classification of mental disorders for global primary care and the overarching typologies of mental disorders that have already been described and will continue to emerge from NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)project. RDoC is an important new planned/emerging initiative in the NIMH Strategic Plan. It is anticipated that the development of a clinically useful mental health classification system under this initiative will enhance the objectives of the emerging RDoC project, and in turn be informed by the domains developed by RDoC as it progresses.</p>
<p>Focusing on clinical utility as an overarching priority, formative field studies will be designed to address three (3) broad goals: (1) how disorder categories should be organized to inform decisions about the overall architecture of the classification system by examining the relationship of possible structures to clinicians' conceptualizations of mental disorders and their clinical management. This requirement would focus in part on whether it is possible to construct a clinically useful classification for mental disorders for global primary care that is consistent with current knowledge regarding brain circuits that are thought to be important in mental disorders, the focus of RDoC; (2) which disorders, conditions, or problems should be included in a diagnostic system to facilitate appropriate identification and treatment of mental and behavioral disorders at each level of care-mental health specialty, primary care, or RDoC-related research. The primary care classification will involve specification of classification entities that may be different from entities used by specialists, as well as developing algorithms for cross-linkage of primary care, specialist, and research categories. Studies in primary care settings will focus on obtaining the best coverage of high-incidence and high-resource mental health problems, some of which may be most usefully described at the level of problems or symptom clusters rather than by formal diagnoses. Existing knowledge and hypotheses about underlying brain systems will also be considered in order to simplify, clarify, and reduce the number of mental disorder diagnoses essential for global primary care; and (3) how each disorder should be defined and described to offer maximum utility for primary care clinicians and their patients.</p>
<p>A number of alternatives to existing diagnostic approaches have been proposed as ways to improve the clinical utility of diagnostic systems, including dimensional ratings and prototype matching. It is likely that a mix of models will be required to classify, diagnose and shape management decisions for mental disorders (Parker et al., 2008). Studies will focus on the comparative clinical utility of different approaches in specific settings and for different purposes, including mental health specialty, primary care, and RDoC-related research.</p>
<p>Project Requirements. Qualified sources will be required to: 1) Establish several international field study centers in low-, middle-, and high-income countries; 2) Develop, translate, and pilot test specific protocols for a clinically useful classification of mental disorders for global primary care; 3) Develop plans for implementation, data management, and analysis; and 4) Interact and collaborate with NIMH and other investigators on the RDoC project as this initiative progresses.</p>
<p>Other important considerations. In order to perform this work, qualified sources shall have:</p>
<p>1) The capability to access and improve the clinical utility of the diagnostic system for mental and behavioral disorders in the revision of the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th version<br />2) The infrastructure to establish international field study centers in low, middle, and high-income countries<br />3) Current international collaborations with investigators who have a record of productive research and international collaboration focused on the diagnosis of mental and behavioral disorders.<br />4) Experience/expertise in: diagnosis of mental disorders, psychiatry, clinical psychology or counseling psychology</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance. The resulting contract has an anticipated period of performance of 3 years.</p>
<p>Capability Statement. Any small business that believes it has the capability to fulfill this requirement should submit a brief narrative response (5-10 pages, single-spaced), indicating previous experience and capabilities related to the described work. Capability Statements should describe (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, <br />references, and other related information (f) any other resources available to support this project. Also include respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code.</p>

The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background. The CNS HIV Antiretroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) study was awarded in September 2002, under contract N01MH22005, to the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) to examine the presentation and predictors of neurologic complications of HIV in the era of combination antiretroviral treatment (ART). In addition to this primary objective of the contract, UCSD has established, characterized, and stored samples from the CHARTER patient cohort and made them available to scientists conducting HIV-related central and peripheral nervous system studies. The program has accumulated invaluable clinical and research data on approximately 1,600 participants and longitudinal data has been collected on a subset of 600 participants.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives. The goal of the new CHARTER Resource contract is to further utilize and expand the data and specimens collected beyond the original contract period, to serve as a resource to the broader NeuroAIDS research community. This collection will be an ongoing and important resource that has been requested by NeuroAIDS research investigators as they continue to study the pathophysiology of HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND). If a follow-on study to CHARTER is approved by the NIH, new samples and data will be added to the collection over the next 5 years.</p>
<p>Project Requirements. The key work to be continued includes:</p>
<p>1) Enhancement of the web-based communication suite, publications tracking system, and imaging utility in place at UCSD under the current contract;</p>
<p>2) Development of a system for collecting data generated from ancillary investigations and a mechanism for "freezing" digital datasets which are used for analyses and publications;</p>
<p>3) Providing scientific investigators access to all stored clinical samples that have been collected under the current contract, and samples that will be accumulated under the follow-on contract, if approved;</p>
<p>4) Establishment and maintenance of a scientific review system to determine whether exhaustible clinical samples should be sent to ancillary research investigators;</p>
<p>5) Providing other specialized services, such as assays or complex data analyses, possibly on a re-charge basis such that the requestor pays actual cost for services rendered;</p>
<p>6) Providing expert advice in the form of interpretation of results, analyses planning, assays, project design, and collaboration with Resource Specialists from each core to assist investigators with complex data and/or sample requests; <br />7) Reporting on structured feedback and indicators of the CHARTER Resource program success.</p>
<p>Other important considerations. In order to perform this work, qualified sources MUST have:</p>

An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background. The CNS HIV Antiretroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) study was awarded in September 2002, under contract N01MH22005, to the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) to examine the presentation and predictors of neurologic complications of HIV in the era of combination antiretroviral treatment (ART). In performance of this contract, UCSD has examined 1,574 participants cross-sectionally, 657 participants longitudinally, and is continuing to follow additional subjects through the contract expiration date in August 2010.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives. The data collected to date has helped advance the knowledge of the pathophysiology of HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND), and a continuation of this research is required.</p>
<p>The goal of the follow-on research is to continue assessment of subsets of the longitudinal patient cohort studied under this contract. This will provide detailed answers to key follow-up questions based on the preliminary findings. The proposed program may help to identify the biomarkers that annotate disease progression and address key questions relevant to the persistence of HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) and inform therapy.</p>
<p>Project Requirements. The key issues to be explored include:</p>
<p>1) whether low-level HIV replication in the cerebral spinal fluid is a predictor of HAND;<br /><br />2) whether HAND will be present in the CHARTER cohort who experienced failure of antiretroviral therapy to control HIV replication in the cerebral spinal fluid, (HAND will be assessed by annual neurocognitive and brain imaging); <br /><br />3) assessment of the predictors of neurological injury by examining cases that are receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and undergoing cognitive decline or increasing white matter abnormality. Drug resistance profiles, in CSF and Plasma of those cases with neurocognitive decline and increasing white matter abnormality, will be examined to determine the contribution of evolution of viral strains with discordant resistance. evaluation of skin biopsy variables may be required as they are related to key disease and treatment parameters to define the extent to which nerve injury is reversible or irreversible in the context of ART treatment.</p>
<p>Other Important Considerations. In order to perform this work, qualified sources shall have: <br /><br />1) access via informed consent to a cohort of 180 well-characterized, longitudinally studied patients under contract N01MH22005, who have been followed by the University of California at San Diego and at 5 other sites (sub-awards);</p>
<p>2) experience in performing multi-site clinical studies and experience/expertise in neurocognitive and neurological assessments, neuroimaging, virology and genetics.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance. The resulting contract has an anticipated period of performance of 5 years.</p>
<p>Capability Statement.

<DESC><p>Synopsis:<br />This is not a Notice of Solicitation. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has recurring but irregular needs for different types of temporary residential housing throughout the year. Requirements range from very short term, 90 days or less, fully furnished and serviced dwellings to longer lengths of stay, apartment style housing, one year or more. NIH wishes to explore the local market based on the full complement of requirements to determine how to best satisfy ongoing housing needs.</p>
<p>Delineated Area:</p>
<p>All requirements must be within walking distance of the METRO within the towns of Rockville or Bethesda, MD, or within walking distance (20 minutes) to the NIH campus in Bethesda, MD.</p>
<p>Specific Inquiry:</p>
<p>NIH is interested to learn if it is possible to establish a contract(s) which will allow a firm fixed rate for a stated term, regardless of how many units are leased, their location and the duration of each.<br />NIH is also interested to ascertain if one supplier in the market can provide all requirements within one contract, or multiple contracts by housing type.</p>
<p><br />Discussion:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health is comprised of 27 institutes and centers which have varied needs for temporary housing. Several of the institutes have summer training programs for 15-30 students per program for approximately 6 weeks in the early summer. Other institutes have an occasional requirement to house one or two people for a longer term while they complete a specific assignment.<br />There are also programs where a student may work and study on the NIH campus part of the year and then relocate to another city or country for the remainder. These needs are for the most part known ahead of time, although there may be an occasional immediate need. NIH has a continuing requirement for approximately 25 long term (1+ year) efficiency, one bedroom and two bedroom unfurnished temporary housing units with offstreet parking available.</p>
<p>Requirement:</p>
<p>NIH routinely requires:<br />&nbsp; 1. 7-15 units for 45 Day Minimum residential efficiency, 1 bdrm and 2 bdrm furnished, <br />Including furnishings, utilities. At times, regular use of a conference room is required, <br />as well as offstreet parking. <br />&nbsp; 2. 15-25 units for Apartment style, unfurnished efficiency, 1 bdrm and 2 bdrm units which include<br />utilities but are unfurnished with offstreet parking.</p>

The NAIC is 441310.  Interested parties, please contact Debbie Kahawai @debbie_kahawai@nps.gov by March 1, 2010.  All prospective offerors interested in submitting an interest on this notice must be registered in the CCR database.Scope of WorkUtilities Terrain Vehicle (UTV)Repair and Replacement PartsPadre Island National SeashoreCorpus Christi, Texas

INTRODUCTIONThe scope of this project is to purchase 4X4 Utility Terrain Vehicle (UTV) repair and replacement parts.  Padre Island National Seashore operates sixty Utility Terrain Vehicles (UTV's) on an average of ten hours per day continuously for four months during the Kemps Ridley sea turtle nesting season.  These vehicles require constant repair due to the corrosive environment and bad beach driving conditions.  
Padre Island is the longest undeveloped barrier island in the United States and is situated off the southeast coast of Texas.  The National Seashore encompasses 130,434 acres of barrier habitat, is approximately 70 miles-in-length, and ranges from two to three miles-in-width.  The park is bordered on the east by the Gulf of Mexico and is separated from the Texas mainland to the west by the Laguna Madre, a shallow, hyper saline body of water.
The Kemp's ridley sea turtle is listed as the most endangered species of sea turtle.  It is also the smallest of all species, and it nests mostly during the daytime hours and often on very windy days.  The tracks of this species do not remain on the beach very long and it is often challenging to locate the nest where the eggs are located.  
GOALS/OBJECTIVES The goal for this scope of work is to have a vender readily available to:1.	Supply all needed parts in a short time frame.2.	All parts at a fair and reasonable price3.	To provide technical support4.	Authorize vendor to cover warranty work as needed on the UTV's.5.

Objective is to keep this fleet of UTV operating with the least amount of down time as not to effect the operation of the Endangered Kemp Ridley Sea turtle Program.
BACKGROUND INFORMATIONPadre Island National Seashore is located in Southeast Texas.  The Park is an environmentally sensitive barrier island on the Gulf of Mexico approximately seventy miles long.  It is the longest stretch of primitive, undeveloped ocean beach in the nation and home to endangered sea turtles, various crustaceans, plants, and multitudes of water and island birds.  Padre Island National Seashore has operated UTV's since 2007.  
These vehicles are use to patrol seventy miles of beach operating 10 hours per day.  Beach driving conditions are extremely rough on these vehicles and they require constant repair.  During the turtle patrol season we strive to keep all vehicles operating.  If vehicles fail to operate our Kemp Ridley Sea turtle program would suffer.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENTSynopsis: 
THE 2007 NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE APPLICABLE TO THIS PROCUREMENT:   221 UTILITIES
THIS IS NOT A REQEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  
The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, PWD Pensacola, FL, intends to award a contract to one source (Gulf Power Company, the local franchised electric utility provider) under the authority of 10 U.S.C  2913 which allows the Navy to enter into agreements with gas or electric utilities to design and implement cost-effective demand and conservation incentive programs (including energy management services, facilities alterations, and the installation and maintenance of energy savings devices and technologies by the utilities) to address the requirement and circumstances of the installation.  This contract is referred to as Utility Energy Services Contract (UESC).   
The UESC award is for various Energy Conservation Measures in specified facilities at Naval Air Station Pensacola as a result of a no-cost preliminary energy audit.  The process requires that the responsible Utility must have the ability to provide or obtain financing on terms offered to its most favored customers in a comparable service class, or with a comparable risk profile.  Therefore, contractor will not receive compensation until completion of the implementation project, and payments will be based on a long-term (11 year) amortization schedule.    
Interested utilities may identify their interest and ability to meet the requirements stated herein may submit their corporate capabilities for consideration.  The submission must include the utility company's NAICS code and Cage Code.    A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Responses to this posting must be submitted to alice.oberhausen@navy.mil in PDF format no later than 26 February 2010.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."
<p>Nellis AFB Las Vegas, NV, 89191 requires the lease renewal and support for one (1) each portable trailer located at Creech AFB. The 99th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Alutiiq International Solutions of 325 N. Saint Paul St,, Dallas, TX 75201. Alutiiq currently owns and maintains the existing leased trailers at Creech AFB. These trailers have been installed at Nellis AFB for a number of years. In establishing a new lease, compared to renewing the existing lease, it is likely that the award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. <br />Per FAR Part 5.207-13, Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:<br />22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within ten (10) days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may e-mail marka.garrison@nellis.af.mil or fax 702-652-9570, Attn: Mark Garrison, not later than Thursday, 25 February, 2010, 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time.</p>

The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements. <br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition with the following addendum to the provisions of the standard provisions.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, all offers will be considered for BEST VALUE.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers. (1) Technical capability. Additionally, any potential offerors quoting a brand equivalent must supply supporting documentation that the product quoted is of equal or greater technical capability matching the specified equipment in features, quality, warranty terms, compatibility with existing systems, and functionality to be considered.

<li><span>3.<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'"> </span></span>Past performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, cost and past performance are also important to the overall contract award decision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All evaluation factors will be adjectivally rated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal, conforming to the RFQ, is determined to be most advantageous and offers the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractor in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFQ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each proposal<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the RFQ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed criteria listed in the Statement of Work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Cost - </strong>The Contracting Officer shall evaluate the fairness and reasonableness of the total proposed price/cost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To determine reasonableness of price/cost, the Government will review the price including the element of costs used to develop the proposed price to assess whether the offerors price proposal demonstrates a clear understanding of the statement of work requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government will analyze financial capabilities based upon the offeror's documentation to undertake the proposed project and other factors as outlined in FAR 9.1, Responsible Prospective Contractors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government may request additional information on financial resources and performance capability from the offeror in order to evaluate the offeror's ability to perform on the proposed contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Past Performance - </strong>The Offeror shall be evaluated on performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services on recent, relevant contracts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An Offeror with no past performance information will receive a neutral rating (i.e. the rating will not add to or detract from its rating).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, this evaluation will not be conducted on any offeror whose proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror.</p>

<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Purpose:</span></span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The purpose of this effort is to develop course design guides (also known as preliminary plans for instructional design) of training for the following:</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i) inspectors for examining the safety of hydrogen systems on-board commercial vehicles and</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(ii) drivers for awareness of the hazards of hydrogen systems on-board commercial vehicles.</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Background:</span></span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">As the result of an earlier effort prompted by the President's Hydrogen Fuel Initiative, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) in 2007 published three documents pertaining to the safety of operations and maintenance of commercial vehicles using hydrogen as an alternative fuel. These documents are as follows:</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i) "Guidelines for Use of Hydrogen in Commercial Vehicles,"</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(ii) "Changes to Consider in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations and North American Standard Inspection Procedures to Accommodate Use of Hydrogen as an Alternative Fuel in Commercial Vehicles," and</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(iii) "System Safety Plan for Commercial Vehicles Using Hydrogen as an Alternative Fuel."</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">These documents are posted at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/facts-research/art-public-reports.asp"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">www.fmcsa.dot.gov/facts-research/art-public-reports.asp</span></a></span></span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">As the result of funds made available by Congress in 2009 through the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), FMCSA is able to pursue follow-on effort to carry out some of the recommendations made in the above documents. The two recommendations that will be carried out in this effort are associated with training of inspectors and training of drivers.</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The "Changes to Consider in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations and North American Standard Inspection Procedures to Accommodate Use of Hydrogen as an Alternative Fuel in Commercial Vehicles" document noted that the fuel system is a critical safety component and recommended Out-Of-Service criteria for removing a commercial vehicle from operation in the event of an on-board hydrogen leak. Therefore, it follows that commercial vehicle inspectors should be trained to look for hydrogen leaks. The "Guidelines for Use of Hydrogen in Commercial Vehicles" recommended that commercial drivers be given hydrogen hazard awareness training. Therefore, a statement of work is devoted to development of course design guides for commercial vehicle inspectors and drivers in hydrogen safety.</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">It is important to realize that while not all the standards have been put in place to regulate hydrogen safety on commercial vehicles, training will evolve and expand to assimilate new standards. For example, the standard having the most significant impact on the use of hydrogen as an alternative fuel in commercial vehicles is being developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). [NHTSA has jurisdiction over all vehicle manufacturers and issues the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards while FMCSA has jurisdiction over operations and maintenance of commercial vehicles and issues the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations.] NHTSA is developing a standard for compressed hydrogen gas storage containers used on vehicles. Although this is an important, new standard, FMCSA anticipates that this standard will be very similar to the requirements from the current standard for compressed natural gas storage containers used on vehicles. When NHTSA issues that particular standard for hydrogen storage containers on vehicles, FMCSA will incorporate the training requirements for compliance with that standard.</span></span></p>

Statement of Work (SOW)

Background:  

The FDA requires a titration instrument that will provide significant data on the specific DNA sequence-based genetic structures of several of the most common Salmonella strains associated with human illness caused by the consumption of fresh produce. These data will facilitate the design of specific diagnostic tests for effective detection, identification, and differentiation of foodborne outbreak strains of Salmonella.  That is, the full-length genomic data harvested from this project will allow for the identification of effective nucleic-acid and protein based targets for uniquely and unambiguously identifying a specific strain or serovar of Salmonella.  All data to be generated will encompass a comprehensive genomic database of Salmonella pathogens within CFSAN that are commonly associated with foodborne outbreaks originating from fresh-cut produce and undercooked poultry and eggs. 


Scope:

The titration instrument shall support two major directives of our department mission.
	a) Development of methodology for establishing biomarkers particularly for
	    foodborne pathogens;

b)  and application of analytical methods for the assessing safety and efficacy of  
     regulatory products.


Technical Specifications Instrumentation design and Performance work statement:

The following specifications represent minimum acceptable criteria.

52.204-11  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act—Reporting Requirements (Mar 2009) 
(a) Definitions. As used in this clause— 
“Contract”, as defined in FAR 2.101, means a mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services (including construction) and the buyer to pay for them. It includes all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types of contracts, see FAR Part 16. 
“First-tier subcontract” means a subcontract awarded directly by a Federal Government prime contractor whose contract is funded by the Recovery Act. 
“Jobs created” means an estimate of those new positions created and filled, or previously existing unfilled positions that are filled, as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as “full-time equivalent” (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. 
“Jobs retained” means an estimate of those previously existing filled positions that are retained as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as “full-time equivalent” (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. 
“Total compensation” means the cash and noncash dollar value earned by the executive during the contractor’s past fiscal year of the following (for more information see 17 CFR 229.402(c)(2)): 
(1) Salary and bonus. 
(2) Awards of stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights. Use the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the fiscal year in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004) (FAS 123R), Shared Based Payments. 
(3) Earnings for services under non-equity incentive plans. Does not include group life, health, hospitalization or medical reimbursement plans that do not discriminate in favor of executives, and are available generally to all salaried employees. 
(4) Change in pension value. This is the change in present value of defined benefit and actuarial pension plans. 
(5) Above-market earnings on deferred compensation which is not tax-qualified. 
(6) Other compensation. For example, severance, termination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or property if the value for the executive exceeds $10,000. 
(b) This contract requires the contractor to provide products and/or services that are funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). Section 1512(c) of the Recovery Act requires each contractor to report on its use of Recovery Act funds under this contract. These reports will be made available to the public. 
(c) Reports from contractors for all work funded, in whole or in part, by the Recovery Act, and for which an invoice is submitted prior to June 30, 2009, are due no later than July 10, 2009. Thereafter, reports shall be submitted no later than the 10th day after the end of each calendar quarter. 
(d) The Contractor shall report the following information, using the online reporting tool available at   www.FederalReporting.gov. 
(1) The Government contract and order number, as applicable. 
(2) The amount of Recovery Act funds invoiced by the contractor for the reporting period. A cumulative amount from all the reports submitted for this action will be maintained by the government’s on-line reporting tool. 
(3) A list of all significant services performed or supplies delivered, including construction, for which the contractor invoiced in this calendar quarter. 
(4) Program or project title, if any. 
(5) A description of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract, including significant deliverables and, if appropriate, associated units of measure. 
(6) An assessment of the contractor’s progress towards the completion of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract (i.e., not started, less than 50 percent completed, completed 50 percent or more, or fully completed). This covers the contract (or portion thereof) funded by the Recovery Act. 
(7) A narrative description of the employment impact of work funded by the Recovery Act. This narrative should be cumulative for each calendar quarter and only address the impact on the contractor’s workforce. At a minimum, the contractor shall provide— 
(i) A brief description of the types of jobs created and jobs retained in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). This description may rely on job titles, broader labor categories, or the contractor’s existing practice for describing jobs as long as the terms used are widely understood and describe the general nature of the work; and 
(ii) An estimate of the number of jobs created and jobs retained by the prime contractor, in the United States and outlying areas. A job cannot be reported as both created and retained. 
(8) Names and total compensation of each of the five most highly compensated officers of the Contractor for the calendar year in which the contract is awarded if—

Attached document-
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


A.	Each justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited. As a minimum, each justification shall include the following information:

1.	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a “Justification for other than full and open competition”.
i.	USCG C2CEN Portsmouth Va. is the requesting agency and the contracting activity.

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.
i.	Support and upgrade renewal for Analytical Graphics, Inc. (AGI) Software.

3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs.
i.	The C2CEN COP(Common Operating Picture) project utilizes AGI Software for development and support of the COP Web Services Subsystem (CWSS).  This requirement is for the support, upgrades, library license renewal of AGI’s Satellite Tool Kit, Terrain Analysis, Spatial Analysis, AGI Viewer and Dynamic Geometry software.  This purchase can be obtained from AGI with an estimated cost of $92K.

4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.
i.	6.302-1(2)(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components there, of, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.

5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.
i.	The AGI Software is currently being used by the CWSS project.  AGI is the only source available to provide license renewal and support for AGI products.     

6.	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.
i.	Requirement shall be posted Brand Specific since this procurement is for continued development of CWSS which utilizes AGI software.   

7.	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.
i.	Compared to previous acquisitions for similar purchases, the cost to the Government is fair and reasonable.

8.	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  
i.	Market Research was conducted using various methods.  The Software Manufacturer, AGI, was contacted to verify whether they were able to meet the Governments needs.  Additionally, internet searches were done for other vendors who could also fulfill this requirement.  No other vendors were found.   

9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:
i.	Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.  
a)	N/A
ii.	When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. 
a)	The cost for this procurement would require the initial purchase of this type of software, plus any license fees.  The initial software procurement was approximately $500K.  In addition to the software purchase, extensive re-engineering of the CWSS system would be required.  This would result in additional labor hours and potential delays in providing COP services to the Coast Guard.  The estimated cost for these engineering services would be at least $300-400K. 
iii.	When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.
a)	N/A

10.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.

B.	Each justification shall include evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation seeking Firm Fixed Price quotes for commercial items and services prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation with estimated repair cost Not-to-Exceed quotes may be submitted for consideration. The purpose of this solicitation is to determine the best value to the government with regard to repair or overhaul of an aircraft component(s). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number HSCG38-10-Q-100023 is assigned for tracking purposes only. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Regulations. Using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) intends to award a service purchase order to the Original Equipment Manufacturer or a legally authorized FAA approved capable repair affiliate. Responsible Vendors may offer a quote for consideration. Firm-Fixed-Price quotes will be evaluated based on a low cost technically acceptable basis. Any Not-To-Exceed quotes received will be weighed against Firm-Fixed-Price Quotes by being evaluated based on best value to the government and a Not-To-Exceed proposed average estimated repair cost plus a maximum economical repair cost. This solicitation is for service to be completed IAW the following Statement of Work.
<p>Scope: This Statement of work (SOW) sets forth the requirements for Engineering and Logistics Support Services for the Oasis Processor System, NSN 5895-01-HS1-7455, P/N 102690-200, in support of the United States Coast Guard's HU-25 aircraft. The Oasis Processor supports the United States Coast Guard's surveillance mission by integrating tracked data from on-board sensors with off-board data to provide a tactical picture for the operator. This picture is used as a source for aircrew and other commanders to make decisions based on real-time situational awareness. This system has had increasing failures due to the age of the components.</p>
<p>Background: The requirement is to conduct an obsolescence study on (P/N 102690-200) Oasis Processor and provide recommendations that will facilitate the repair of this item for the future. The Oasis processor is required for accomplishment of the United States Coast Guard intelligence and surveillance operations conducted by the HU-25 aircraft fleet. The Oasis system provides sensor interface processing and is used on the HU-25 aircraft, a military adaptation of the Falcon 20 aircraft manufactured by Avions Marcel Dassault Brequet of France. The Oasis offers automated correlation and tracking algorithms, track management utilities, and tactical decision aids. This capability enables comprehensive situational awareness and the ability to perform targeting and surveillance using on-board and off-board systems. This requirement is necessary for the Coast Guard to maintain the capability to adequately support deployed HU-25 aircraft that carry out law enforcement and search and rescue missions. <br /><br />Requirements: Contractor shall provide Engineering and Logistics Support Services and provide a technical report for each obsolete item that identified replacement options. The United States Coast Guard's Oasis processors are slightly different than the US Navy Mini-Oasis units that have already been studied by Raytheon in the development of a new Mini-Oasis unit for the Navy. The trade study for these parts will become part of the required USCG obsolescence study at no cost to the USCG. In addition the objective of the USCG Oasis Obsolescence trade study is to investigate and analyze the remaining parts (not previously studied) of the USCG HU-25 Oasis Processor to determine the USCG available solutions for replacement of the obsolete components.</p>
<p>The contractor shall investigate a replacement solution for the obsolete components hardware/software contained within the Oasis Processor (P/N: 102690-200).

A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Very good in all respects.  Advantages/strengths not offset by disadvantages/weaknesses.  Very good probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Government requirements.  <BR>Good	Proposal meets most solicitation requirements and demonstrates a good understanding of the requirements but does not offer significant advantages to the Government over basic RFP requirements.  Disadvantages/weaknesses are not significant, unless significant advantages are proposed that outweigh significant disadvantages.  Where there were areas of concern, clarifications, given by contractor, were acceptable.  Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government requirements.   <BR>Satisfactory	Proposal meets some but not all the RFP requirements, but offers disadvantages (weaknesses) outweighing other advantages (strengths).  Examples may include little or no experience cited; weak proposal; mimics RFP language rather than expressing offerors approach or understanding of the RFP.  Probability of success considered less than full confidence.<BR>Marginal	Proposal meets some but not all the RFP requirements.  Examples:  Proposal does not address all required RFP criteria; little or no experience to the extent that Overall quality cannot be determined because of errors, omissions or deficiencies that may be capable of being corrected without a major rewrite or revision of proposal.  Probability of success is questionable without further explanation by offeror.  <BR>Unsatisfactory	Proposal demonstrates little to no understanding of the requirements; or approach fails to adequately meet acceptable performance expectations.  Proposal contains major errors; omissions or deficiencies.<BR><BR>The following rating will be used for Past Performance Rating:<BR>Risk rating	Description of risk rating<BR>Very Low Risk	Very high quality past performance.  Problems, if any, were negligible and were resolved in a timely and highly effective manner.  Performance was generally current and very relevant to relevant.  Excellent probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Governments requirements.  <BR>Low Risk	Good quality past performance.  Minor problems may have been identified however; contractor took satisfactory corrective actions to resolve where appropriate.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to relevant.  Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR>Average Risk	Adequate quality of past performance.  Problems may have been identified and the contractor usually took adequate corrective action.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Although performance exceeds expectations and was rated excellent to very good the projects submitted were generally semi-relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation.  Fair probability of success with an average degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR>Above Average Risk	Rather poor quality of past performance. Problems may have been identified and contractor occasionally took corrective action, but not always to the owners satisfaction.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Fair probability of success with an overall above average risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>High Risk	Unacceptable quality of past performance. There were problems, some of a somewhat serious to serious nature.  Contractors corrective action was sometimes marginally effective to ineffective.  Performance was current and very relevant to semi-relevant.  Probability of success is questionable with an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>Neutral	No current and/or relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.  Government personnel were unable to identify any relevant Past Performance information for the offeror or key team members/subcontractors.  This is neither a negative nor a positive assessment.  <BR><BR><BR><BR>The following rating will be used for Past Experience Rating:<BR>Risk rating	Description of risk rating<BR>Very Low Risk	Extensive amount of past experience in required areas of expertise identified in Performance Work Statement.  Detailed experience was generally current and very relevant to relevant.  Excellent probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Governments requirements.  <BR>Low Risk	Good amount of past experience in required areas of expertise identified in Performance Work Statement. Detailed experience was current and generally very relevant to relevant.  Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR>Average Risk	Adequate amount of past experience in required areas of expertise identified in Performance Work Statement.  Experience was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Fair probability of success with an average degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements. <BR><BR>Above Average Risk	Very little of past experience. Experience was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  Fair probability of success with an overall above average risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>High Risk	Unacceptable amount of past experience. Experience was current and very relevant to semi-relevant.  Probability of success is questionable with an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.<BR>Neutral	No current and/or relevant experience record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.  Government personnel were unable to identify any relevant Past Experience information for the offeror or key team members/subcontractors.  This is neither a negative nor a positive assessment.  <BR><BR><BR>The government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).

(a) The Contractor agrees to— 
(1) Comply with the Privacy Act of 1974 (the Act) and the agency rules and regulations issued under the Act in the design, development, or operation of any system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function when the contract specifically identifies— 
(i) The systems of records; and

(2) Include the Privacy Act notification contained in this contract in every solicitation and resulting subcontract and in every subcontract awarded without a solicitation, when the work statement in the proposed subcontract requires the redesign, development, or operation of a system of records on individuals that is subject to the Act; and 
(3) Include this clause, including this paragraph (3), in all subcontracts awarded under this contract which requires the design, development, or operation of such a system of records. 
(b) In the event of violations of the Act, a civil action may be brought against the agency involved when the violation concerns the design, development, or operation of a system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function, and criminal penalties may be imposed upon the officers or employees of the agency when the violation concerns the operation of a system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function. For purposes of the Act, when the contract is for the operation of a system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function, the Contractor is considered to be an employee of the agency. 
(c)(1) “Operation of a system of records,” as used in this clause, means performance of any of the activities associated with maintaining the system of records, including the collection, use, and dissemination of records. 
(2) “Record,” as used in this clause, means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and that contains the person’s name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a fingerprint or voiceprint or a photograph.

“Subcontract” means any contract, as defined in 2.101, entered into by a subcontractor to furnish supplies or services for performance of a prime contract or a subcontract. It includes but is not limited to purchase orders, and changes and modifications to purchase orders. 
“Subcontractor” means any supplier, distributor, vendor, or firm that furnishes supplies or services to or for a prime Contractor or another subcontractor. 
“United States”, as defined in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(38), means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
(b) Enrollment and verification requirements.

(i) Enroll. Enroll as a Federal Contractor in the E-Verify program within 30 calendar days of contract award; 
(ii) Verify all new employees. Within 90 calendar days of enrollment in the E-Verify program, begin to use E-Verify to initiate verification of employment eligibility of all new hires of the Contractor, who are working in the United States, whether or not assigned to the contract, within 3 business days after the date of hire (but see paragraph (b)(3) of this section); and 
(iii) Verify employees assigned to the contract.

The Contractor shall follow the applicable verification requirements at (b)(1) or (b)(2) respectively, except that any requirement for verification of new employees applies only to new employees assigned to the contract. 
(4) Option to verify employment eligibility of all employees. The Contractor may elect to verify all existing employees hired after November 6, 1986, rather than just those employees assigned to the contract. The Contractor shall initiate verification for each existing employee working in the United States who was hired after November 6, 1986, within 180 calendar days of— 
(i) Enrollment in the E-Verify program; or 
(ii) Notification to E-Verify Operations of the Contractor’s decision to exercise this option, using the contact information provided in the E-Verify program Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). 
(5) The Contractor shall comply, for the period of performance of this contract, with the requirements of the E-Verify program MOU.

(ii) During the period between termination of the MOU and a decision by the suspension or debarment official whether to suspend or debar, the Contractor is excused from its obligations under paragraph (b) of this clause. If the suspension or debarment official determines not to suspend or debar the Contractor, then the Contractor must reenroll in E-Verify. 
(c) Web site. Information on registration for and use of the E-Verify program can be obtained via the Internet at the Department of Homeland Security Web site: http://www.dhs.gov/E-Verify.

(3) Who has undergone a completed background investigation and been issued credentials pursuant to Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors. 
(e) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include the requirements of this clause, including this paragraph (e) (appropriately modified for identification of the parties), in each subcontract that— 
(1) Is for— 
(i) Commercial or noncommercial services (except for commercial services that are part of the purchase of a COTS item (or an item that would be a COTS item, but for minor modifications), performed by the COTS provider, and are normally provided for that COTS item); or

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>The 902d Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB intends to award a Sole-Source purchase order to Gentex Corporation for the purchase of items listed in the Description of Supplies/Services.  This notice of intent is neither a request for quotes nor a solicitation of offers; however all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Government if received by 12:00 PM CST, Wednesday, 17 February 2010.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 
This is a streamlined combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This purchase will be made using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 6.302-1 and FAR 13.501(a) (1) (ii), Test Program for Commercial Items. The clauses and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.

The NAICS Code is 336413; size standard is 1000 employees.  A Firm-Fixed-Priced award will be issued.

DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES

CLINs: 0001, 0002, 0003, 0004 and 0005
Description: The MBU-20/P oxygen mask system contains a separate inhalation and exhalation valve.  The separate oxygen valves require the oxygen delivery hose to be offset from the center of the mask.  The inhalation and exhalation valves are interconnected by a compensation tube.  The compensation tube senses inhalation pressure and a portion is directed to the underside of the exhalation valve plate.  The compensation pressure keeps the exhalation valve shut during inhalation.  The mask incorporates microphone to allow crewmembers to communicate.  The communication process interfaces with the HGU-55/P helmet and with the aircraft intercommunication system.  The MBU-20/P oxygen mask comes in five sizes.  We are requesting 20 each small narrow, 70 each medium narrow, 70 each medium wide, 30 each large wide, and 10 each extra small narrow.  
SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:

Gentex Corporation is the sole source manufacturer of the USAF MBU-20/P mask.  Gentex  Corporation is capable in providing immediate assistance in constructing the masks required to outfit the new Aircrew Flight Equipment section located in Pensacola, Florida.  Gentex Corporation is unique in constructing and providing all baseline parts to build and maintain the masks in accordance with USAF technical data.  The masks are equipped with an inhalation valve, exhalation valve, compensation tube, oxygen hose, three prong connector, microphone, communication cor  d, and bayonets, all which are essential in flying operations. The MBU-20/P oxygen mask is the only mask which has been tested to provide the absolute essential safety requirements for our aircrew. Any and all replacement parts of the MBU-20/P oxygen mask is ordered through Gentex Corporation.  The USAF technical order, TO 14P3-1-161 outlines the precise inspection  and maintenance procedures for this particular type of mask only.  The MBU-20/P oxygen mask manufactured by Gentex exceeds the requirement of any other off-the-shelf            oxygen mask which can be purchased.  The MBU-20/P oxygen mask is constructed for           USAF military pilots only. The oxygen mask provides a unique system which can be            transferred from trainer type aircraft to fighter aircraft in a matter of seconds.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, and a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the RFI. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI. The purpose of this RFI is to receive feedback from industry in regard to the following and is in support of market research. Information is being gathered to determine if more than one supplier has the capability to fully meet the Government's stated requirements. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking interested sources capable of providing integration services to support the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program. The mission of the CTR Program is partnering with willing countries world-wide to reduce the threat of WMD and related materials, technology, and expertise, including providing for the safe destruction of WMD, associated delivery systems, and related infrastructure. Historically, CTR partners included states of the Former Soviet Union, but recent legislation has broadened the program worldwide. Systems engineering practices and procedures are a critical component of these complex engineering projects, beginning from the design stage through project close out. The CTR Program continues to dismantle and eliminate strategic weapons delivery systems and prevent the proliferation of weapons technology, materials, and expertise. The CTR program also facilitates defense and military contacts to encourage military reductions and reform. In the FY 2010 budget request, the Department of Defense expanded the strategic focus of the CTR program to support the Global War on Terrorism. In FY 2001, the CTR Program awarded the current CTR Integrating Contract (CTRIC), an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract to five integrating contractors to support the CTR Program. The ordering period ends on 06 September 2011, with all on-going work to be completed NLT 06 September 2012. Future ID/IQ task orders whose durations are not appropriate to the period of performance of the existing CTRIC contract are expected to be awarded under a new contract. In FY 2008, the CTR Program awarded a separate ID/IQ contract to support its Biological Threat Reduction Program (BTRP). In anticipation of the sunset of the current CTRIC in 2012, DTRA anticipates soliciting a multiple-source capability for an integrated approach to support the CTR Program in its non-BTRP operations and programs. The maximum value of the proposed acquisition is currently estimated at $800M over a ten-year period (initial five-year contract with a possible five-year option award term based on performance.) The projected start date is January 2010. Potential sources either alone or with appropriate teaming partners must have demonstrated expertise/capability in all the following areas. &bull;Provision of safe, secure, efficient, and accurate planning, organizing, management, integration, systems engineering, reporting, operations, maintenance, logistics, construction, eradication, decommissioning, extraction, dismantlement, handling, and transportation support to accomplish the following tasks outside of the United States; &bull;Provide expertise on WMD non-proliferation and sponsor collaborative efforts between WMD development experts and their respective laboratory and research facilities; &bull;Provide non-proliferation threat awareness and equipping, as well as non-proliferation and consequence management training and exercises; &bull;Establish and maintain a comprehensive WMD detection and interdiction capability to promote interdiction of illicit trafficking in WMD and related materials; &bull;Provide training needs assessments, curriculum development, and training support to fulfill contract objectives; &bull;Assist in the development/update of Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for nations receiving CTR assistance; &bull;Expeditiously perform CTR support tasks including travel support for government and contractor personnel, transportation of materials to partner sites, warehouse management, equipment and maintenance support, or short term procurement, construction, and renovation support for facilities and infrastructure required by the programs; &bull;Eliminate WMD delivery systems and their support infrastructure (solid/liquid-fueled rockets and air-breathing weapons, bombers, submarines, and other platforms); &bull;Dispose of the residual products and by-products of WMD delivery systems; &bull;Eliminate WMD production facilities and their associated support infrastructure; &bull;Secure, store and account for sensitive items of WMD delivery systems and their warheads; &bull;Design, estimate, construct, and demolish horizontal (e.g., trenching, roads and railroads) and vertical (e.g., buildings, bunkers, and towers) infrastructure identified in applicable task orders; &bull;Provide vulnerability assessments, security enhancement recommendations, and implementation of USG-accepted enhancements at sensitive WMD sites/facilities; &bull;Provide sustainment needs assessments including: maintenance and repair requirements, support equipment requirements, spare parts, logistics requirements, transportation, procedure requirements, or other related topics, as well as implementation of USG-accepted recommendations; &bull;Provide assistance to the appropriate executive agent(s) or CTR designated representatives of CTR partner countries for the transport of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) to designated locations/facilities for planned dismantlement.

DTRA anticipates moving further with this acquisition in the near future.

CTRIC Follow-on Industry Day Update The acquisition schedule for the CTRIC follow on contract is on a temporary pause. The new tenative Industry Day is scheduled for November 2009 and the anticipated award date is scheduled for November 2010.

<DESC>2/16/10-The Business Declaration Form has been added as an attachment to this announcement.  All submittals require a completed Business Declaration Form.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at the FAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement for office relocation and furniture reconfiguration services.  The contractor shall perform all of the services required to remove office furniture, equipment, excess material, and related supplies from its present location, transport the property to the designated areas within the new location and place them at the new location.  The contractor shall furnish laborers, trucks and furniture moving equipment (e.g. four wheelers, carts, etc.) to accomplish the work described in the Statement of Work; e.g. excess property pick up, furniture installation/reconfiguration, moving activities, special event activities, furniture cleaning, furniture repair, specialized moving activities and special handling moving activities.
While a contract for these services was awarded in September, 2009, it was determined that the estimated scope of work was not accurately reflected in the schedule of work.  This "re-compete" effort reflects the revised scope of work.  The current contract will be "Terminated for Convenience" of the Government upon award of the new contract.
This requirement is 100% set-aside for competition among small businesses.
A technical, as well as cost, evaluation will be conducted to determine "Best Value" to the FAA.  A detailed description of the technical submittal and subsequent evaluation can be found in Sections L and M of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO).  All technical submittals should be organized as directed in Section L.
It is anticipated that an Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type contract with Time-and-Material pricing arrangements will be awarded as a result of this SIR/RFO.  It is anticipated that the base period of the new contract will run from April 1, 2010 to September 31, 2010, with option years available on a fiscal year basis for the following four years.    
ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SIR/RFO AND SOW MUST BE RECEIVED PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 16, 2010 FOR ANSWERS TO BE PROVIDED BEFORE THE PROPOSALS ARE DUE.
Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration, www.ccr.gov on the date established for receipt of offers, February 25, 2010.  Reference AMS clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), "if the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."  
In addition, all contractors shall complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form with their proposals. The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.
Technical and cost proposals must be received by the FAA, no later than 2:00 p.m. CST, Thursday, February 25, 2010.  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.
Hand-delivered responses will need to allow sufficient time to process through security procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.  Overnight delivery of responses to this SIR/RFO could also be impacted if not sent in sufficient time to allow for special mail handling procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.
Potential offerors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one or more offerors at any time during the solicitation process.

This requirement will result in the award of multiple Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for large-scale systems integration acquisitions, and the integration, modification, and maintenance of current systems which will have significant impacts on future program needs in DOJ components. Since 1988 the DOJ has sought the services of the private sector to provide highly qualified and skilled individuals in all areas of Information Technology. The purpose of this request for information is twofold: first, to determine the acquisition strategy regarding small business participation, and second, to get industry comments on the draft Statement of Work (SOW). Through this synopsis, the DOJ is requesting the capabilities and past performance of small business contractors interested in providing these services across DOJ Programs. Interested small business contractors including small disadvantaged business, women-owned small businesses, 8(a)&rsquo;s, HUBZones, Veteran-Owned small businesses, are encouraged to respond. In addition, the DOJ is requesting comments on the draft SOW from both large and small businesses. <br /><br />The Department is contemplating award of ten to fifteen (10-15) contracts and based on response to this request for information will be able to determine the appropriateness of small business participation. The actual number of awards will depend on the number, merit quality/capability, and eligibility of the prime contract proposals received. <br /><br />Background: The Draft SOW for this requirement is at Attachment A and the annual estimated number of potential work hours required for each Labor Category is at Attachment B. This request for information is for planning and informational purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this synopsis or the Government&rsquo;s use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor&rsquo;s input resulting from this synopsis. <br /><br />Instructions for Large Businesses: Interested parties are encouraged to submit comments and suggestions related to the draft Statement of Work and Labor Categories.

A description of how you would staff the positions identified in Attachment B with suitable, experienced, qualified, trained personnel. Include in your description whether you would staff these positions through current in house staff or through staff augmentation. If through staff augmentation, please provide specifics. In addition, identify how you plan to maintain adequate staffing levels and your plan for managing employee turnover. Identify your current facility clearance level and provide security levels of employees that would be used to staff the positions. <br /><br />Item 4. A description of your company&rsquo;s suitability and desire to support a wide range of requirements in scope and complexity of task. The complexity of work, duration of task, and staffing requirements will vary significantly depending on the needs of the requiring office. Tasks may range in duration of three months or less to multiple year agreements. Examples of tasks for three separate DOJ components with a wide range of requirements are included in Attachment C. Conversely, task orders may support a single IT function or need with staffing requirements of a single or part-time contractor employee.

The following are some of the requirements for the new 120 KVA Land-Based Mobile Electrical Power Plant (MEPP).  It is anticipated that the MEPP will be a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) item with modifications in order to meet the government’s requirements.  It shall be self-contained, diesel engine driven, electrical power unit on a ruggedized four wheel trailer capable of being towed over paved and gravel surfaces.  The MEPP shall utilize state-of-the-art displays and instrumentation technologies for both engine operations and generator outputs.  As required for any typical Navy support equipment, the MEPP shall be highly reliable, maintainable, and supportable.  As a land-based unit, it shall be capable of meeting shock, vibration, environmental, EMI and mobility criteria.   The MEPP shall generate electric power outputs as follows:  115 VAC, 400 HZ, 28 VDC and 270 VDC output. The diesel powered generator unit shall adhere to the requirements of MIL-STD-704F (at a minimum) for aircraft power characteristics and EPA Emission Standards (Tier 3).  The unit shall be equipped with internally stored output power cables.  The output cables shall connect to all existing Navy and Marine Corp aircraft. The new MEPP shall adhere to national standards as documented in SAE AS8090, utilize state-of-the-art technology, and be transportable in military aircraft(C-5, C-17, C-130, and H-53).   Human factors engineering shall be utilized to the greatest extend possible to make the new MEPP a user friendly piece of Support Equipment. The Contractor will clearly define in their proposals the ability to provide and meet all NAVAIR Logistics requirements (Supply Support, Technical Manual, and Maintenance Plan, to include Supportability Analysis Plan, Training and Warranty).

The Government anticipates the award of a Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with a minimum quantity of 5 Pilot Production Units (PPUs) to be purchased with the first Delivery Order.     After successful completion of contractor pilot production testing and government suitability and supportability evaluation, the government plans to issue delivery orders for the production units over four production years for up to 400 production MEPP units.  In order to determine the best value, the Government will consider strengths, weaknesses and risks associated with the proposal using the best value method of evaluation.  The contract will be awarded to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined to offer the best value to the Government.  Proposals received will be evaluated under the factors of Technical, Past Performance, and Price.  Contractors must be CCR registered.  

The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil  Select “Doing Business With Us” and then “Open Solicitations.”  Look for amendments on the web page.

<DESC>********The Attachment is Corrected - Submission requirements are as Specified Within******


The United States Government (“USG”) is seeking Expressions of Interest from qualified developers to share in the redevelopment of two USG owned residential compounds located in the 19th District in Vienna, Austria into residential condominium developments. The existing compounds are underdeveloped. All existing buildings are expected to be razed in the redevelopment. According to feasibility study performed by a Vienna based architectural/engineering firm, the compounds can support 90+ units under the existing zoning. As conceived, in lieu of cash payment for the land, the USG would receive free and clear a portion of the developer constructed units scattered amongst the compounds. Both the USG and the developer/partner would own their portion of the units in freehold.

Disciplines such as Architectural, Interior Design, Structural, Civil, Environmental, Electrical and Mechanical will be required for design. Innovative construction techniques and facilities that allow fast track execution of the project will be necessary to meet Department of Army requirements for facility completion. Supporting facilities include all utilities, exterior lighting and control, information systems, fire protection; paving, walks, curbs, and gutters; storm drainage; parking; and site improvements. Access for individuals with disabilities will be provided. Heating and air conditioning will be provided by self-contained system.

<DESC>The Single and Dual Telemetry Kits are produced in accordance with the NAWCWD Statements of Work and meet the required form, fit, and function requirements of the current Technical Data Package (TDP) 13593285 and13590840  for a pre-existing Patriot missile system boattail section.   The single telemetry kit consists of one (1) RF transmitter, antenna set, Power Diode Assembly (PDA), kit installation hardware and RF cables.  The dual telemetry kit consists of two (2) RF transmitters, antenna set, diplexer, kit installation hardware, Telemetry Electronic Module (TEM), TEM cable, and RF cables. At the component level, the kit requires transmitters (single-and dual-frequency), diplexers, antennas, and hardware mounting kits (single- and dual-frequency).  Some components may be subject to military standard or military specification requirements. Some components require prequalification of a vendor under Source Control Drawings. To qualify a product under a Source Control Drawing, a vendor's product must undergo article qualification at their own expense.  A maximum of ten (10) dual telemetry kits and one (1) single telemetry kit will be produced. These Telemetry Kits are intended to support a U.S. Army Patriot Test and Training program.  The U.S. Army has a scheduled missile firing program that begins March 2011.  Preparation and testing of the Patriot Missile System with the telemetry kit requires the kits to be at the field activity by December 2010.

Rational for using a noncompetitive approach.

The licenses for SQL and Terminal services are the only comprehensive remote acccess methodology available to allow access into the IHS network and are considered industry standard.  It has been determined that these licenses will meet allof IHS' short-term and longe term requirements to provide a secure and supportable solution for VPN users.  Another overriding factor for consideration is the ability of inter-relationship of the licesnes to the overall application solution which will provide the VPN user access to specific appliations within the IHS firewall.

MS Terminal Services and MS SQL will allow IHS server and security administrators to install, configure, manage and maintain applications centerally on a few servers.  Together this solution will save on IT support costs for the information systems infrastructure.  Furthermore, centrally-deployed applications are easier to maintain (for example, patching and upgrading) and simpler to troubleshoot.  As a result, downtime is reduced, users are more productive, and security is properly maintained.  Additionally, since in a terminal server environment all application logic runs on the server, the processing and storage rquirements utilizing MS SQL database for client machines are minimal.

<DESC>Construct an Army Reserve Center (ARC) located adjacent to the existing 1SGT Adam S. Brandt Army Reserve Center on the Curtis Bay GSA Depot approximately 13 miles south of Baltimore, MD. The New training building is located to the north of the existing training building on site. The existing north POV parking will be repaved and striped to accommodate an additional 158 POVs providing a total of 272 spots for existing and new buildings. The new ARC will include a training facility at 36,644 square feet, a new 8,043 square foot Organizational Maintenance Shop (OMS), a 1,670 square foot unheated warehouse building and Military Equipment Parking (MEP) and Privately Owned Vehicle parking facilities of 6,200 SY and 5,565 SY respectively. The ARC training facility will use a combination of structural steel framing with metal studs and batt insulation and gypsum sheathing with a brick veneer for the exterior walls. The new ARC will house classrooms, administration, physical readiness center, weapons Simulator, weapons storage and vault, assembly space, kitchen, and equipment storage areas. The training building is a two-story facility. The OMS building will use Concrete Masonry Unit (CMU) with a brick veneer for the exterior wall system. The facility siting and layout is planned to allow for future service bay Expansion. The roofs for the ARC and OMS will be an asphaltic roofing system with a 3 and 4 per foot slope. The third and final facility is a small unheated warehouse for storage of unit equipment. The unheated warehouse building will be a pre-engineered metal building with masonry wainscot and metal panel siding. This project was designed LEED Silver Certifiable and was registered with the USGBC by the Designer for the Corps of Engineers.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION FOR Standard Communications	1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity.	VA Boston Healthcare System, Office of Information Technology  (VA BHS)*2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved.	Emergency replacement of power system for the West Roxbury telephone system*3.  Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).		Procurement of site specific replacement power system valued at approximately $32,000.	4.  Identification of the statutory authority permitting other    than full and open competition.	10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2) or 41 U.S.C 253(2), (FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency)*5.  Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority sited. 	The equipment is not a standard off the shelf item. The original unit was specifically built for VA BHS.   The vendor was the original installer 5 years ago and has continued to hold the maintenance contract for all of our telephone systems at BHS.  This Vendor is the only responsible source as they are the designer and are intimately familiar with the system (i.e. the interoperability of the switches at all divisions, operator Automated Call Distribution of calls, linking of Voicemail, AutoAttened System, etc to serve all BHS Phone Switches and users).  The vendor and their staff have met all security requirements of the VA and OI&T.*6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are Solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a FedBizOpps notice was or will be published.	Due to the urgency of the requirement a FedBizOpps will not be published in advance.  Further, this requirement is being set aside pursuant to the Public Law 109-461. 7.  Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.   	The estimated costs are comparible to the contract prices from the original purchase 5 years ago.8.  Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names, of  firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.	Due to the urgency of the requirement a market survey was not conducted.*9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition  have not been developed or are not available.	An emergency situation exists due to a fire which destroyed the originally installed equipment.  BHS is currently in a very vulnerable state.  We are running the phone switch with no battery back -up, no power filtering, and no redundancy.  Because West Roxbury is the central hub of the phone system as BHS this mean that if there is a power failure all divisions on BHS will lose their telephone system, if there is a power spike then all division of BHS will lose their phone system and there is a extremely good chance we will damage at least part of if not the entire phone switch (approximately $1 Million) at West Roxbury. 10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.As described above, due to the urgency of the requirement the acquisition has not been announced and is being solicited as a SDVOSB set aside pursuant to the Public Law 109-461.11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.The Contracting Activity will continue to promote full and open competition, where possible.	CERTIFICATIONI hereby certify that the data provided herein is complete and accurate to support other than full and open competition.                                                          DEBORAH SPENCE							(SIGNATURE OF APPROVING OFFICIAL 				DATE         FOR REQUESTING SERVICE)                                                                		CONTRACTING OFFICER                           DATE

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1(c)
<AWDNBR>n/a
<ARCHDATE>03162010
<DESC>Application for Brand Name JustificationEach justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited. As required of FAR 6.302-1( c ), each justification shall include the following information:  1.	Requesting Agency:	Department of Veterans AffairsAustin Information Technology Center (AITC)1615 Woodward StreetAustin, TX 78772Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans AffairsCenter for Acquisition Innovation - Austin1615 Woodward StreetAustin, TX 787722.	Nature and/or description of the action:  The Department of Veterans Affairs, Austin Information Technology Center (AITC), is in need of License and Warranty renewal purchase for SyncSort BackupExpress software and service for Web Operations based at CRDC in Falling Waters, WV.3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):  This acquisition will provide warranty licensing and support on existing software to allow Web Operations to continue uninterrupted operations.  The warranty support will be for one 12 month period and two 12 month option periods.4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.    FAR Part 6.302-1(c) Application for brand name descriptions This is a brand name warranty renewal using the authority of FAR  Part 6.302-1(c)  The contracting officer has determined that the circumstances of this contract action deem that only one source, in this case brand name, will fill this requirement. Resellers that reflect savings to the Government are permitted.5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. The Web Operations mission to provide access to information is essential to our veterans.  The use of the NetApp brand is essential to the Government's requirements; a large portion of the existing Web Operations backup strategy is based on SyncSort's BackupExpress solution.  The continued use and cost of maintaining the existing solution for updates and technical support is less than the cost of replacing and re-training personnel on a new software solution.6.	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  All SEWP IV orders are placed under existing IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity) contracts, and thus are not required to be synopsized pursuant to FAR 16.505 (a)(1).  The SEWP IV GWAC is composed of five (5) groups of contracts.  At a minimum, to provide Fair Opportunity as required by FAR Part 16, all contract holders within any one individual group must be provided the opportunity to quote. The contract specialist shall utilize the SEWP IV RFQ and search tools, which automatically provide the Fair Opportunity groupings when selecting contract holders.7.	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  SEWP and GSA have already competed the products on their schedules.  The previous price competition ensures that the pricing of the latter orders are considered fair and reasonable. 8.	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  These items are widely available on SEWP and GSA schedule.  By searching on the part number in the established catalog or price lists available at the websites of http://www.sewp.nasa.gov and http://www.gsaadvantage.gov it can be shown that many vendors are able to compete for this requirement. 9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: (i)	Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. (ii)	When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. (iii)	When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government. Purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed because the brand name is necessary to meet the Government's needs as stated in numbers 4 and 5 of this document.10.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.N/A11.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.Solicitations for future requirements will utilize "brand name or equal" language, if it is in the Government's best interest to do so.  The current requirement must be solicited using a brand name description because the Government needs to create an exact copy of a system that is currently in use.
