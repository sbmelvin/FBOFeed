<DESC>he NAVY EXPERIMENTAL DIVING UNIT, Panama City, FL. Intends to procure via SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES, SOLE SOURCE to University of Buffalo, NY. Task 1 Requirement - Probabilistic Dive Planner: NEDU currently has a requirement to verify and modify code for the Probabilistic Dive Planner. The interface to the model code was constructed to use a string to pass in the contents of the original input file to the command line program.  NEDU shall have the code translated to a language that can be directly linked with the translated model code allowing all of the code to be compiled into a single executable. The contractor shall remove the restrictions between the interface and the processing code that existed due to the use of the processing code. The contractor shall provide support in the modification of communication routines/protocols between an interface for a dive planner and existing probabilistic model code. The purpose of the changes is to make the interface more flexible and improve the dive planners efficiency by allowing the model state to be saved between successive calls from the interface.Task 2 Requirement - Oxygen Toxicity: Using NEDUs information, the contractor shall generalize the data for application to other durations and surface intervals to expand the scope of usefulness for data collected.  The contractor shall assess the models in reference to NEDUs data, select applicable injury and recovery models, fit parameters, and modify the models as necessary to create generalized guidance for exposure to PO2 The intent is to use existing oxygen exposure and outcome data to determine potentially acceptable combinations of dive profiles at PO2 and recovery times on atmospheric air.  Task 3 Requirement  Test a closed circuit breathing Oxygen Measurement System.  The contractor shall convert measurements of PO2 to FO2 while correcting for non-linearity of the O2 sensors.  This information once obtained will be critical to determine quantity of oxygen required for procedures using an emergency breathing system. This information will be used to determine sustainable PO2 time intervals and purge procedures.  Information obtained will be used to formulate maximum sustain PO2 levels and storage volume of Oxygen required for given scenarios.This is an ongoing research from the University of Buffalo. Phone/fax is unacceptable. E-mail request to louis.diehl@navy.mil NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE.

REGIONAL ELECTRICITY MARKET ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
Starting Date: September 2008
This announcement is about plan for the USAID Central Asia to implement the Regional Electricity Markets Assistance Program (REMAP).  REMAP is proposed for three years with two years optional start in September 2008. 
Water and energy resource management remains critically important for economic and social development in Central Asia. The first phase of REMAP implemented by the U.S. Energy Association (USEA) from August 2006 demonstrated that it is possible to make progress towards market-based resolution of energy and water management challenges. 
The project will be implemented in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan with some participation from Afghanistan by a contractor procured through a full and open competition process. A draft Request for Proposals will be issued on May 23rd 2008.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Effective May 31, 2008 the current contract expires in its final period of performance.  The opening of a VA staffed outpatient clinic under a lease agreement scheduled to coincide with the current contract expiration date is currently behind schedule.  The immediate need of the patients does not permit adequate time to pursue full and open competition.  Further, Wellmont Healthcare Systems already has established patient records; the appropriate state license; VHA background checks; and credentialed physicians and personnel familiar with the utilization of the VA Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).

Interested parties shall submit a capabilities statement addressing the following items:<BR><BR>"	Provide a capability statement of delivering a working multispectral sensor for integration into a mobile partner such as the Biometrics Automated Toolset (BAT). Design documentation shall be provided. <BR><BR>"	Provide a capability statement for delivering one fully functional working model of a multispectral imaging fingerprint capture device that can be integrated with the BAT. This should include delivering a software development kit to enable this integration. <BR><BR>"	Provide a capability statement for delivering 50 multispectral imaging based fingerprint capture devices that are integrated and compatible with the BAT. <BR><BR>Background. Obtaining both biometric and biographical data and enrolling individuals in a database has been the approach taken with the Biometrics Automated Toolset (BAT). Networked by approximately 75 servers, there are approximately 3000 BAT clients in use in OIF and OEF. The BAT system currently captures three biometric measurements: fingerprint, facial recognition, and iris. <BR><BR>Current fingerprint readers are prone to poor image quality under a variety of common conditions. Small amounts of contamination or excessively dry or moist skin can hamper or even preclude the capture of an acceptable fingerprint image. Further, a significant percentage of the population has fingerprints that result in consistently poor images because of genetics, poor health, age, or even profession. Ridges are sometimes worn, or they dont have enough collagen to remain firm when pressed on the platen. Conventional optical sensors are also subject to being flooded in direct sunlight and typically cannot handle extremes in temperatures. <BR><BR>Interested firms should provide a solution for multi-spectral imaging technology addressing the capabilities referenced in the above bullets.  Also interested firms should provide information stating whether this will be a new prototype or equipment currently offered commercially.  The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest and capabilities of firms who can support this requirement.  If you believe your firm can perform this type of support, the government is interested in receiving a technical capability statement.  Technical capability statements can be submitted in your own format and shall be 7 pages or less.  Interested firms should submit their written responses to the Contract Specialist, Cynthia Hall, via email:  cynthia.m.hall@us.army.mil, no later than 6 May 2008.  Any questions or concerns, please contact the Contract Specialist at 520-533-0363 or the Contracting Officer, Jadie Russell at 520-533-1694 or Technical Point of Contact (only for technical related questions), Matt Malanowski, 520-533-4665. This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow-up information requests.  <BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a combined Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information (RFI).  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  As proscribed in the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act, the Air Force is in the process of implementing a fee-for-service aerial refueling (FFS/AR) pilot program as a complement to existing Air Force organic capability.  The purpose of the pilot program is to assess the feasibility and utility of incorporating commercial service provider(s) in Air Force operations long-term.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market research effort being conducted by Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) to determine potential sources capable of providing this fee-for-service aerial refueling service.  Under the pilot program, each service provider refueling aircraft must be able to off-load fuel utilizing centerline flying boom equipment and a probe and drogue system.  The latter may be satisfied by one or both of: 1) centerline hose/drogue equipment; 2) multi-point hose/drogue equipment (i.e. wingtip refueling pods).  No developmental funding is available to capitalize or establish sources capable of providing this service.  Respondents should also assume that no government furnished property will be available to establish any commercial aerial refueling capability (such as excess KC-135 aircraft or spare aerial refueling components such as center-line booms).  The government is interested in identifying sources of commercial-off-the-shelf aerial refueling services that are or will be capable of initiating performance in the FY09/10 timeframe.  Potential sources should include their size status for NAICS code 481212.
This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  In accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation the Government is conducting Market Research.  This Market Research is for information and planning purposes only.  Before submitting any information to the Government, be advised that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of these questions or to otherwise pay for the information you provide.  Your responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.  This information will be used to assist in developing the acquisition strategy.  Any information provided by the Government at this time is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to a formal release of a Request for Proposal.

The government may award contracts for concept refinement studies if more detailed information on fee-for-service aerial refueling is needed based on responses to this RFI.  The concept refinement studies may be awarded through the Broad Area Announcement (BAA) process.  If concept refinement studies are needed, they will be synopsized approximately two months from the date of this announcement.

As set forth in the FY08 NDAA, the pilot program will be not less than five years.  Multiple contractors may be selected to participate in the pilot program.  The pilot program will not exceed more than two aerial refueling aircraft per provider.  The pilot program may encompass and/or evaluate the following missions as directed in the FY08 NDAA:  testing support, training support to receiving aircraft, homeland defense support, deployment support, air bridge support, aeromedical evacuation, and emergency air refueling.  Additional missions may be incorporated as Air Force requirements are established.

In responding to this RFI, the government is specifically interested in receiving the following information from interested FFS/AR providers.  Information collected will be used to assist the government in drafting its requirements and establishing its acquisition strategy for the pilot program.

1)	Describe your ability to acquire/develop/operate/certify aerial refueling aircraft equipped with both flying boom-type and multi-point probe and drogue fuel delivery systems in light of the desired FY09/10 pilot program initiation date;

2)	Describe your current or planned capability to hire/train/certify personnel qualified to perform/sustain the aerial refueling service (including flying boom operators);

3)	What are the minimum and maximum allowable annual flying hours you could provide as a FFS/AR pilot program provider?

4)	Identify any anticipated legal/indemnification/insurance issues the government might encounter in utilizing FFS AR from your firm; 

5)	Describe your knowledge of and your capability to obtain Federal Aviation Administration certification (to include parts 91, 121, and 125), and public-use certification for the military air refueling issues for CONUS and outside CONUS operations; 

6)	Describe the potential costs-to-the-government of utilizing your commercial fee-for-service program that would not be captured in the pilot program's pricing.  Specifically the government is interested in the potential liabilities it might face at the completion of the pilot program if commercial FFS/AR is not continued with your firm.

7)	Describe your firm's experience in performing in conjunction with Air Mobility Command operations and your organizations ability to integrate its operations (existing or planned) with those of AMC.

8)	In order to reduce the impact to current refueling fleet training during the pilot program, we are interested in proposed billing concepts that enable receiving aircraft to pay for services through their respective flying hour program, versus using existing refueling aircraft flying hour funding.  Describe your capability to utilize this type of billing procedure.

9)	Describe your firm's current or planned capability to collect the following data for the pilot program as directed by Section 1081 of the 2008 NDAA:
(a) Missions flown;
(b) Mission areas supported;
(c) Receiver aircraft number, type, model series refueled;
(d) Fuel dispensed;
(e) Departure reliability rates;

10)	Describe any other fee-for-service program efforts you may have had with the U.S. Government for aerial refueling or other air transport services.     If any, please state your last commitment.
a)	Type of service provided
b)	Date(s) of service provided
c)	Government point of contact (name, phone number, e-mail address)

11)	Identify the quantity, size and type of aerial refueling equipment organic to your company at the present time.

12)	Are your company's existing or planned aircraft or AR equipment owned or leased?

13)	Are your personnel currently qualified to provide aerial refueling services of the types contemplated above?

14)	If not, describe your firm's plans to ensure they are qualified and provide your concept to maintain aircrew proficiency. 

15)	What percentage of your company's assets or fleet will be dedicated to USAF support during the pilot program?

16)	What is your expected turn around time for providing aerial refueling mission support to AMC (i.e. time between sorties)?

17)	What is the location of your present/planned operating locations for AR services?

18)	How much advance notification is required to meet AMC AR mission tasking requirements under the pilot program?

19)	Request you supply the Air Force with a copy of your company's portfolio (e.g., balance sheet, income statement and statement of retained earnings).

20)	Provide company point(s) of contact, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and company status (i.e., small business, HUBZone business, etc.).
Responses submitted should be one copy, a maximum of fifty pages in length, and must be received by 28 March 2008.  Request for Information responses may be submitted electronically or regular mail, but require both electronic and hard copies of responses.   Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size in accordance with the size standard; ensure that the company name, address, a point of contact with e-mail address and telephone number, Federal CAGE Code, and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.   No collect calls will be accepted.  Responses should be sent to ASC/XR, (Eric Crawford), 2145 Monahan Way, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH  45433-7017.

<p>Description<br />The 6th Contracting Squadron (6 CONS) at MacDill AFB issues this Sources Sought Synopsis for information and planning purposes only. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the government nor will the Government pay for any information solicited. The purpose of this Sources Sought is to identify potential sources that are interested in and capable of providing the software described herein. As a result of this Sources Sought, 6 CONS may issue a Solicitation/Request for Proposal (RFP). However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against 6 CONS shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought (e.g., use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement).<br />GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: The 6th Contracting Squadron is seeking vendors who can provide the following: Mapping and Visualization Software. The software needs to have the following features/capabilities:<br /><br />A visual mapping program for capturing, organizing, and sharing information and ideas. It should be designed to be primarily used at the earliest point in the planning and development processes and secondarily, throughout the ongoing evolution and management of those efforts.<br /><br />A mapping software to make use of objects, links, and text expanding from a central point in a map to create a descriptive diagram expressing a particular subject.Mind maps are needed and will be used to represent ideas, words, tasks, timelines, and concepts, and to support study, decision making, and organizational problem solving. <br /><br />A program to effectively and productively reduce the number of layers in our design, planning, and development process. From simple maps such as meeting agendas and project projections to deeply complex expressions of new ideas, the software needs to provide an ability to physically demonstrate the way in which we visualize a particular plan or idea. Fundamentally, we need a tool to help others understand what one is thinking about, how it was thought up in the first place, and all the things you think are important and relate to the main point you're trying to make. It should provide the means by which people can see your thoughts from your perspective.</p>
<p>Other required aspects of the application are:</p>
<p>&bull; MS Office app linking within maps:</p>
<p>- Excel: should be able to display a dynamic view of an Excel spreadsheet within a visual map, i.e. a real-time window to monitoring changes in frequently-changing data</p>
<p>- IE: need a currently-viewed webpage and its URL to be easily and immediately added to a map</p>
<p>- PowerPoint: need an integral MS PowerPoint feature to enable the display, tweaking, and exporting of maps to PowerPoint</p>

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of potential small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) that can provide the following analytical report:

The purpose is to demonstrate risks due to changing the manufacturing site can be managed strictly within the manufacturer's change control process so that a supplement to an application is not required.

Changing sterile drug product manufacturing sites poses risks to product safety and quality. Currently, changing manufacturing locations is considered a "major" change, requiring a company to submit a supplement to an application. The Office of Pharmaceutical Science (OPS) has embraced Quality by Design (QbD) to ensure that risks associated with manufacturing changes are managed within the manufacturer's internal change control process. 

OPS reviewers make decisions on product safety and quality based on how a manufacturer describes site specific changes to their sterile manufacturing process.  OPS reviewers require detailed information regarding the proposed manufacturing facility, the manufacturing process, the methods by which the processes will be validated, and the expected outcome of validation studies. 

Specifically, the vendor shall demonstrate how changing the manufacturing site for sterile drug products can be managed strictly within manufacturer's internal change control process. The authorization to do this would be granted through approval of a risk management plan.  Risks include sterility assurance failures due to variations in the facility, manufacturing process, design space and/or process control strategies (e.g. validation, sampling, monitoring, and acceptance criteria), and the introduction of impurities to the drug product as a result of changes, raw materials, equipment, and/or container closure components.  The vendor shall describe a way to make manufacturing site changes using change control processes that are part of Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP).  To accomplish this goal, the vendor shall interview industry experts and OPS review staff. The vendor shall then document the findings, using ICH Q9 Risk Management and OMB/OSTP's "Updated Principles for Risk Analysis."  Following development of a work plan, the tasks will be divided into a data gathering process and summary, followed by the risk management draft document for each product class (synthetic and biotech).  The performance period will be one year from the time of award.  The NACIS code for this work is 541618. 

The NAICS Code is 541618 interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice.  However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents capacity and capability to provide the required specific instrument.  Responses to this notice shall be limited to 15 pages, and must include:

2. Name, title, telephone number, and e-mail addresses of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses.
3. Business size for NAICS 541618 (size standard, $ or number of employees) and status, if qualified as an 8(a) firm (must be certified by SBA), Small Disadvantaged Business (must be certified by SBA), Woman-Owned Small Business, HUBZone firm (must be certified by SBA), and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (must be listed in the VetBiz Vendor Information Pages).
4. DUNS number, CAGE Code, Tax Identification Number, and company structure (Corporation, LLC, partnership, joint venture, etc.). Companies also must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR, at www.ccr.gov) to be considered as potential sources.
5. Identification of the firm's GSA Schedule contract(s) by Schedule number and contract number and SINs that are applicable to this potential requirement are also requested.
6. If the company has a Government approved accounting system, please identify the agency that approved the system.
Please submit copies of any documentation such as letters or certificates to indicate the firms status (see item #3, above).  Teaming arrangements are acceptable, and the information required above on the company responding to this announcement, should also be provided for each entity expected to be teammates of the respondent for performance of this work.  To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure.

THIS NOTICE IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in this announcement. This request is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request.

<DESC><p>*** BACKGROUND *** The National Pandemic Influenza Plan (Nov. 1, 2005) designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response for pandemic preparedness. Following the issuance of this plan, the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) was charged with gathering information, developing policies and issuing recommendations on specific medical countermeasures may be used to contain, control, and mitigate the mortality and morbidity associated with an influenza pandemic in the U.S. The office of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is responsible for the tactical and logistical implementation of policies and decisions regarding these countermeasures, including the establishment of a stockpile of supplies to prevent or control the spread of pandemic influenza disease. This is a Request for Information (RFI) about parties with the interest and capabilities to perform certain testing of vaccine components in the BARDA pandemic preparedness stockpile. It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.
<p><br />*** OBJECTIVE *** As part of its preparations, HHS/ASPR/BARDA has established a stockpile of avian influenza vaccine antigens to be administered in a pandemic or pre-pandemic situation for the prevention of avian influenza disease. In order to extend the number of effective doses that can be provided from the stockpile, BARDA is also working with manufacturers to develop antigen-sparing technologies such as components that can be added to the vaccine to enhance its immune response, known as adjuvants. In the event of a pandemic emergency, HHS would like to be able to extend the available stockpile of antigens by administering them with adjuvants depending on availability. In order to have this ability, BARDA, in conjunction with NIH, CDC, and the antigen and adjuvant manufacturers, is planning to conduct clinical testing of possible antigen:adjuvant combinations, the results of which would be submitted to U.S. regulatory agencies as support for an Emergency Use Authorization. Evaluation of these investigational formulations will be made by serological testing for immunogenicity by appropriate assays for influenza vaccines. BARDA seeks qualified contract research organizations having the necessary capabilities and willingness to conduct this testing. This is a request for such organizations to make themselves known to BARDA and provide information concerning their capabilities to perform the testing. Please provide information concerning the following required capabilities.</p>
<p>1. Conducting immunological testing of sera from human clinical trials</p>
<p>2. Assessment of sera for the presence of antibodies reactive with influenza antigens by Inhibition of Hemagglutination (HAI) and Microneutralization (MN) assays, using reagents specific for the vaccine (homologous) or other (heterologous) influenza strains.</p>
<p><br />3. Must possess the necessary facilities, capabilities, and expertise to conduct GLP human serology analysis in compliance with all applicable codes and regulations.</p>
<p>4. Capacity for up to 10,000 samples for the duration of the testing</p>
<p>5. Availability to start in January 09-June 09 timeframe</p>
<p>Data obtained from this RFI will be used by HHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy for National Pandemic Preparedness.</p>
<p>All information submitted to HHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant Federal law and will be eligible for additional special protections under the conditions of the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) Program outlined in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002.<br /><br />Information must be submitted by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on May 30, 2008. Include the name, email address and telephone number of a primary contact point at your organization for this RFI in the event that HHS has additional questions or requires clarification on the submitted information. Responses are limited to 2 pages.</p>
<p>All questions and your responses to this RFI must be submitted electronically in .pdf format and emailed to schuyler.eldridge@hhs.gov. An alternate point of contact may be reached at kevin.nilles@hhs.gov. The type of business submitting the response (i.e., small business, large business, hub-zone, small and disadvantaged business, etc.) must be identified in your response. If the service can be acquired on a GSA schedule, VA schedule, or other Government-wide acquisition vehicle, please supply the contract title and number, contract point of contact information and the name of the awarding agency.</p>

<DESC>Request for additional Information (RFI) For Precision Guidance Kit (PGK)Increment 2

The US Army Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&LLCMC) Acquisition Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems is seeking information from Industry on their ability to develop and qualify a Precision Guidance Kit  Increment 2 (PGK-2) solution for 105mm HE projectiles with threshold requirements that will include a delivery accuracy of 30 meter CEP, GPS P(Y) SAASM, a 105mm deep intrusion fuze well depth, and Enhanced Projectile Inductive Artillery Fuze Setter (EPIAFS) compatibility. The objective requirements for PGK-2  are to provide a single technical solution for all US 105mm and 155mm projectiles (HE and cargo) with an Anti Jam capability, short intrusion fuze well, and compatibility with the Non-Line of Sight - Cannon (NLOS-C) automatic handling systems.
The Government contemplates award of contract(s) in mid calendar year 2009. The proposed acquisition strategy for PGK-2 will be broken out to represent the following:

The PGK-2 program consists of three phases. Phase 1 is expected to be approximately twelve months and consists of design maturation and a competitive shoot-off leading to a downselect to the best approach based on demonstrated accuracy and reliability, as well as, cost and potentially an assessment of design maturity (including size/weight/performance compliance of the overall design and subcomponents), compatibility with applicable 105mm and 155mm artillery projectiles, and the proposed countermeasure/anti-jam approach.  Phase 2 is expected to be approximately fifteen (15) to twenty four (24) months and consists of final design and qualification of a PGK-2 production representative system to support Milestone C.  The government anticipates requesting proposals for the design/qualification and initial production implementation for capabilities that are beyond the threshold capability of US 105mm HE projectiles.  These may include options for implementation of discrete objective capabilities listed below:

- GPS Anti Jam (design/qual and Initial production costs)-105mm cargo projectiles (design/qual and Initial production costs)-155mm cargo projectiles (design/qual and Initial production costs)-155mm HE projectiles (design/qual and Initial production costs)
Following a Milestone C decision, there is a planned Initial Production and Deployment (IP&D) Phase (3) that contains four production options (1 year per option). 

The government is interested in respondents assessment of the technical feasibility of implementing the following within the PGK-2 timeline given above:
-	Designs that are either compatible with current STANAG for cargo projectiles or an alternative approaches that will be compatible with the actual physical interface constraints on US cargo projectiles 
-	Size compliant and performance compliant designs during Phase 1
-	Inclusive of countermeasure/anti-jam demonstration in Phase 1
-	A GPS standard interface so that alternative GPS approaches/suppliers could easily be  integrated into PGK-2 designs during its development/production phases
-	Respondents should include information regarding the GPS jamming environment that their system can tolerate with their basic design and with possible added Anti-Jamming features includes the respective accuracy performance.  (Note:  The Excalibur Performance Spec Appendix C on GPS anti-jam for given scenarios is available as a comparison requirement to the emerging PGK-2 Anti-Jam objectives, which are likely to be similar). 
-	Respondents should include information regarding their solutions behavior and performance in a GPS jamming environment when GPS guidance is never attained. 
-	Respondents should discuss their solutions method of Anti-Jam and the maturity of their design.    (Note: the Navy Guidance Integrated Fuze (GIF) SBIR program has developed a performance specification for an anti-jam environment.  Through this program they have identified potential materiel solutions for projectile spin rate of up to 300 Hertz.)

The government is performing an analysis of restructuring the PGK program to deliver one HE (105mm and 155mm) PGK and one cargo (105mm and 155mm) PGK and is seeking industrys assessment of this approach.

Respondents should include information regarding any desired changes to the EPIAFS message set or other EPIAFS interface changes desired for the respondents solution (government makes no assurances that respondents desired EPIAFS changes can or will be implemented). 

Interested respondents may obtain the following upon request and coordination with POC listed below.  A Non-Disclosure Agreement (available upon request) signed an on file and a DD2345, and Form 1350 at a minimum, will be required:

-	PGK-2 DRAFT Performance Specification-	105MM Data Aero Coefficients-	105MM Weapon/ Projectile Interface-	155MM Data Aero Coefficients -	155MM Weapon/ Projectile Interface -	Interface Control Document (ICD) between Fuze Setter and Excalibur Increment Ib (M982E1) Extended Range Projectile, 12999868-	Operational analysis for 105mm Precision Guided Munitions-	Lessons Learned  Briefing for Gun Fired Smart Munitions-	GPS User Equipment Interface Control Document-	The Guided Integrated Fuze (GIF) RFP w/ alternative MOFA component TDP(s): HOB Portion of TDP-	Excalibur Performance Spec Appendix C on countermeasure/anti-jam 

The following information is also being finalized for release by the end of May 2008 and will be available provided a Non-Disclosure Agreement (available upon request) signed an on file and a DD2345 are submitted to POC listed below:

-	Physical Properties Interface Matrix of 105MM and 155MM Projectiles-	An update on the ARDEC MEMS Safe and Arm efforts -	Data from the D-Fuze 105mm testing that will be conducted in May 08-	155mm spin-stabilized artillery control authority report from ARL-	Draft contract report on the ArrowTech Incorporated PRODAS upgrade (Note: The Government has developed improved PRODAS capabilities through efforts with ArrowTech and will use these capabilities to evaluate potential prototype aerodynamic characteristics)-	GIF Anti-jam Performance Specification

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Columbia Area Office intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WS DOT) for Relocation Counseling Services.The Bureau of Reclamation is in the process of acquiring a private campground located north of Highway 24 and east of the Yakima River, Yakima, WA., under the authority of the Yakima River Basin Water Enhancement Project. At the time of acquisition the campground should have between thirty to forty tenants. Under the Federal Relocation Assistance Program these tenants have benefits and entitlements.
Reclamation needs an immediate contract in place that will assist these tenants, displaced persons, in the relocation process through services and counseling. Reclamation is required by the Uniform Relocation Act to supply the following services to these tenants: 1) Provide information on the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 and the Uniform Relocation Act Amendments of 1987, the Fair Housing Laws - Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968.  2) Moving Cost Reimbursement.  3) Replacement Housing that is Decent, Safe and Sanitary. 4) Provide Relocation Services Counseling such as but not limited to: Listings of Available Replacement Properties, Local Housing Ordinances, Building Codes, Social Services, Security Deposits, Interest Rates and Terms, Typical Down Payment, VA and FHA Loan Requirements, Real Property Taxes, Consumer Education Literature on Housing.
Reclamation feels that it is in the best interest of the current campground tenants and Reclamation that the WS DOT be the logical choice to provide this service based on their experience in land acquisition, local markets, and relocation services through acquisition for highway right of ways.

As used in this clause--<br />Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.<br />Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, which is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause.<br />(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall re-represent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:<br />(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.<br />(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. (3) For long-term contracts-<br />(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and<br />(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the exercise date specified in the contract for any option thereafter.<br />(c) The Contractor shall re-represent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this re-representation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/ .<br />(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.<br />(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the re-representation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure they reflect current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office by e-mail, or otherwise in writing, that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.<br />(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.<br />(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following re-representation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the re-representation was completed:<br />The Contractor represents that it [ ] is, [ ] is not a small business concern under NAICS Code ______________ assigned to contract number ______________.[Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title].<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />The following Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) clause applies and is incorporated in full texts: AFFARS 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman: (a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication or protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. (b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). (c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsman Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-668, email: Michael.Jackson@scott.af.mil.

(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. (e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>Background:</p>
<p>NOAA's Restoration Center, the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and Southeast Fisheries Science Center are partnering with the State of Florida and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to locate and remove illegal lobster condos or "casitas" within the waters of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Casitas are simply a flat sheet of waterproof material (steel, cement, tin, etc.) propped 4-6" above the seafloor on cement parking blocks or similar structures, creating an ideal habitat for lobster. These casitas smother the seafloor by shading out the substrate and concentrate lobsters allowing for increased harvest through illegal fishing. Florida law prohibits harvesting spiny lobster on non-permitted artificial structures. In addition, these condos violate FKNMS dumping regulations as well as cause destruction of natural resources. In 2007, NOAA technicians conducted the side scan sonar survey over an area approximately 12 square miles north of the lower Keys to locate the illegal fishing gear. NOAA contractors visited over 100 target sites and removed over 60 of the illegal structures from the seafloor. The debris was measured for surface area, brought to the surface and then transported to shore for disposal on land.</p>
<p>The activities in this SOW are part of an ongoing effort to continue to remove casita's from the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Work to be performed:</p>
<p>On behalf of NOAA the contractor shall conduct the removal of marine debris that has been illegally dumped on the seafloor. The area of work will be the north side of the Lower Florida Keys from approximately Big Pine Key through Key West in 10' to 40' of water. The contractor must be able to navigate to the identified targets, deploy divers to attach cables and/or lift bags to bring the casitas to the surface, use a lifting device to lift casitas onto a floating platform/vessel, transport debris to shore, and remove debris to an approved landfill facility outside of the Florida Keys. The Contractor shall provide all personnel, materials, equipment, and services needed to remove debris from the seafloor and have it removed from the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.</p>
<p>(a) The contractor shall perform the following work for Casita removal</p>
<p>1: Locate debris sites from provided Lat/Long coordinates and locate debris/casitas on the seafloor from a minimum of five sites daily</p>
<p>2: Attach cables/lift bags/other lifting devices to debris on seafloor for transportation to surface</p>
<p>3: Collect debris/casita from the surface and place onto barge/vessel/or other floating platform</p>
<p>4: Transport debris to shore to deposit into vehicles/trucks for removal</p>
<p>5: Deliver debris to landfill outside of the Florida Keys</p>
<p>6: Document activities with photos/video and a receipt from the landfill</p>
<p>7: Work in concert with Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Law Enforcement, NOAA and FDEP staff.</p>
<p>8: Travel to and from sites at own expense</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall have and provide the following resources:</p>
<p>1: Vessel and shore based equipment needed to remove, transport, transfer and haul up to 6 tons of debris safely from the dive site to shore for deposition daily.<br /><br />2: A competent crew and certified divers who adhere to all safety regulations</p>
<p>3: Knowledge and experience navigating within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary</p>
<p>4: Knowledge and experience as professional divers conducting this kind of debris removal work</p>
<p>Additional Information:</p>
<p>NOAA will identify the locations for the casita removal. Accurate removal is necessary so as not to injure surrounding habitat and the contractor shall be responsible for any additional damage to the resources. NOAA/FKNMS staff will provide on-site guidance in the field for the job. Proper disposal is important so that these materials will not be reused as casitas. Law Enforcement officers will monitor disposal.</p>
<p>Factors to Consider:</p>
<p>(a) Site Work and Conditions<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Sudden and intense rain squall with the possibility of cloud to sea lightening<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: 
Commandant (CG-851) 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606 Washington, D. C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST/TI. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of EMC DMX800 and EMC Brocade DS5000 B 32-Port Switch. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for the Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IV&V has a need for equipment that will provide a small scale replica of the current Consular Consolidated Database configuration. This need is based on IV&Vs task to test all CA applications and systems prior to deployment. There are tools that this configuration (EMC Symmetrix DMX800 and EMC Brocade DS5000 B 32-Port Switch) offers that is unique to any other equipment that may be used to support Oracle 10g RAC because it offers the same technology as the DMX4 in production but in a very small and cost effective package. The DMX800 provides the same functionality including command line interface. Deployment strategies for the IV&V environment will therefore mirror the production environment, hence nothing will be missed during IV&V testing. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for the justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The EMS SAN and Brocade switch are required to effectively model the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) for purpose of testing database configuration and associated end-user software applications. This hardware is being evaluated as follow-on replacements for the current testing platform of IBM servers and backup solution. The EMC SAN and Brocade switch will allow timely shifting between database test configurations that other backup solutions cannot provide, through snapshots of the entire CCD Test Region (totaling close to 800 Gigabytes of data). The EMC Symmetrix DMX800 and EMC Brocade DS5000B 32-Port Switch have undergone test and assessment and will receive final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<SUBJECT>99 -- USAF Fee-For-Service Aerial Refueling Pilot Program
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-FFS-AR-XR001

<ARCHDATE>04122008
<CONTACT>Robert M Nolin, Phone 937-255-6291, Email robert.nolin@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>This is a combined Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information (RFI).  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  As proscribed in the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act, the Air Force is in the process of implementing a fee-for-service aerial refueling (FFS/AR) pilot program as a complement to existing Air Force organic capability.  The purpose of the pilot program is to assess the feasibility and utility of incorporating commercial service provider(s) in Air Force operations long-term.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market research effort being conducted by Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) to determine potential sources capable of providing this fee-for-service aerial refueling service.  Under the pilot program, each service provider refueling aircraft must be able to off-load fuel utilizing centerline flying boom equipment and a probe and drogue system.  The latter may be satisfied by one or both of: 1) centerline hose/drogue equipment; 2) multi-point hose/drogue equipment (i.e. wingtip refueling pods).  No developmental funding is available to capitalize or establish sources capable of providing this service.  Respondents should also assume that no government furnished property will be available to establish any commercial aerial refueling capability (such as excess KC-135 aircraft or spare aerial refueling components such as center-line booms).  The government is interested in identifying sources of commercial-off-the-shelf aerial refueling services that are or will be capable of initiating performance in the FY09/10 timeframe.  Potential sources should include their size status for NAICS code 481212.
This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  In accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation the Government is conducting Market Research.  This Market Research is for information and planning purposes only.  Before submitting any information to the Government, be advised that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of these questions or to otherwise pay for the information you provide.  Your responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.  This information will be used to assist in developing the acquisition strategy.  Any information provided by the Government at this time is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to a formal release of a Request for Proposal.

The government may award contracts for concept refinement studies if more detailed information on fee-for-service aerial refueling is needed based on responses to this RFI.  The concept refinement studies may be awarded through the Broad Area Announcement (BAA) process.  If concept refinement studies are needed, they will be synopsized approximately two months from the date of this announcement.

As set forth in the FY08 NDAA, the pilot program will be not less than five years.  Multiple contractors may be selected to participate in the pilot program.  The pilot program will not exceed more than two aerial refueling aircraft per provider.  The pilot program may encompass and/or evaluate the following missions as directed in the FY08 NDAA:  testing support, training support to receiving aircraft, homeland defense support, deployment support, air bridge support, aeromedical evacuation, and emergency air refueling.  Additional missions may be incorporated as Air Force requirements are established.

In responding to this RFI, the government is specifically interested in receiving the following information from interested FFS/AR providers.  Information collected will be used to assist the government in drafting its requirements and establishing its acquisition strategy for the pilot program.

1)	Describe your ability to acquire/develop/operate/certify aerial refueling aircraft equipped with both flying boom-type and multi-point probe and drogue fuel delivery systems in light of the desired FY09/10 pilot program initiation date;

2)	Describe your current or planned capability to hire/train/certify personnel qualified to perform/sustain the aerial refueling service (including flying boom operators);

3)	What are the minimum and maximum allowable annual flying hours you could provide as a FFS/AR pilot program provider?

4)	Identify any anticipated legal/indemnification/insurance issues the government might encounter in utilizing FFS AR from your firm; 

5)	Describe your knowledge of and your capability to obtain Federal Aviation Administration certification (to include parts 91, 121, and 125), and public-use certification for the military air refueling issues for CONUS and outside CONUS operations; 

6)	Describe the potential costs-to-the-government of utilizing your commercial fee-for-service program that would not be captured in the pilot program's pricing.  Specifically the government is interested in the potential liabilities it might face at the completion of the pilot program if commercial FFS/AR is not continued with your firm.

7)	Describe your firm's experience in performing in conjunction with Air Mobility Command operations and your organizations ability to integrate its operations (existing or planned) with those of AMC.

8)	In order to reduce the impact to current refueling fleet training during the pilot program, we are interested in proposed billing concepts that enable receiving aircraft to pay for services through their respective flying hour program, versus using existing refueling aircraft flying hour funding.  Describe your capability to utilize this type of billing procedure.

9)	Describe your firm's current or planned capability to collect the following data for the pilot program as directed by Section 1081 of the 2008 NDAA:
(a) Missions flown;
(b) Mission areas supported;
(c) Receiver aircraft number, type, model series refueled;
(d) Fuel dispensed;
(e) Departure reliability rates;

10)	Describe any other fee-for-service program efforts you may have had with the U.S. Government for aerial refueling or other air transport services.     If any, please state your last commitment.
a)	Type of service provided
b)	Date(s) of service provided
c)	Government point of contact (name, phone number, e-mail address)

11)	Identify the quantity, size and type of aerial refueling equipment organic to your company at the present time.

12)	Are your company's existing or planned aircraft or AR equipment owned or leased?

13)	Are your personnel currently qualified to provide aerial refueling services of the types contemplated above?

14)	If not, describe your firm's plans to ensure they are qualified and provide your concept to maintain aircrew proficiency. 

15)	What percentage of your company's assets or fleet will be dedicated to USAF support during the pilot program?

16)	What is your expected turn around time for providing aerial refueling mission support to AMC (i.e. time between sorties)?

17)	What is the location of your present/planned operating locations for AR services?

18)	How much advance notification is required to meet AMC AR mission tasking requirements under the pilot program?

19)	Request you supply the Air Force with a copy of your company's portfolio (e.g., balance sheet, income statement and statement of retained earnings).

20)	Provide company point(s) of contact, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and company status (i.e., small business, HUBZone business, etc.).
Responses submitted should be one copy and must be received by 28 March 2008.  In the interest of economy, request submissions be limited to approximately 50 pages.  The response to question 19 is not included in this limit.  Request for Information responses may be submitted electronically or regular mail, but require both electronic and hard copies of responses.   Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size in accordance with the size standard; ensure that the company name, address, a point of contact with e-mail address and telephone number, Federal CAGE Code, and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.   No collect calls will be accepted.  Responses should be sent to ASC/XR, (Eric Crawford), 2145 Monahan Way, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH  45433-7017.     Questions should be directed to Mr. Eric Crawford at 937-255-2649, email eric.crawford@wpafb.af.mil.

The Government extends an invitation to potential prime contractors for the Fee-For-Service Aerial Refueling pilot program to present capabilities briefings in person the week of 14 April 2008.  These face-to-face sessions will be limited to two hours each and will be conducted at Wright-Patterson AFB OH.  Firms interested in scheduling a face-to-face session should contact the above point of contact for available times.  The government will not be able to provide industry with information on any future Fee-For-Service Aerial Refueling request for proposal during these sessions as more detailed requirements documents do not yet exist.

<DESC>This is a combined Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information (RFI).  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  As proscribed in the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act, the Air Force is in the process of implementing a fee-for-service aerial refueling (FFS/AR) pilot program as a complement to existing Air Force organic capability.  The purpose of the pilot program is to assess the feasibility and utility of incorporating commercial service provider(s) in Air Force operations long-term.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market research effort being conducted by Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) to determine potential sources capable of providing this fee-for-service aerial refueling service.  Under the pilot program, each service provider refueling aircraft must be able to off-load fuel utilizing centerline flying boom equipment and a probe and drogue system.  The latter may be satisfied by one or both of: 1) centerline hose/drogue equipment; 2) multi-point hose/drogue equipment (i.e. wingtip refueling pods).  No developmental funding is available to capitalize or establish sources capable of providing this service.  Respondents should also assume that no government furnished property will be available to establish any commercial aerial refueling capability (such as excess KC-135 aircraft or spare aerial refueling components such as center-line booms).  The government is interested in identifying sources of commercial-off-the-shelf aerial refueling services that are or will be capable of initiating performance in the FY09/10 timeframe.  Potential sources should include their size status for NAICS code 481212.
This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  In accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation the Government is conducting Market Research.  This Market Research is for information and planning purposes only.  Before submitting any information to the Government, be advised that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of these questions or to otherwise pay for the information you provide.  Your responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.

Submission of Proprietary Information Caution: The government appreciates that interested firms may not be able to respond to this RFI without disclosing information deemed "proprietary" or "competition sensitive".  Data submitted in response to this RFI will be widely distributed and discussed within the government as it will be used to assist in developing the acquisition strategy for any fee-for-service aerial refueling demonstration program.  It is the responsibility of Respondents to clearly mark submitted information with appropriate restrictive markings.  Respondents are further advised that the government's analysis of your responses may require disclosure of your responses to Advisory and Assistance Services contractor personnel.  If you do not wish your information disclosed to the government's support contractors, or require non-disclosure agreements be established with them prior to their being granted access to your information, your data must be marked accordingly.    

Any information provided by the Government at this time is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to a formal release of a Request for Proposal.

The government may award contracts for concept refinement studies if more detailed information on fee-for-service aerial refueling is needed based on responses to this RFI.  The concept refinement studies may be awarded through the Broad Area Announcement (BAA) process.  If concept refinement studies are needed, they will be synopsized approximately two months from the date of this announcement.

As set forth in the FY08 NDAA, the pilot program will be not less than five years.  Multiple contractors may be selected to participate in the pilot program.  The pilot program will not exceed more than two aerial refueling aircraft per provider.  The pilot program may encompass and/or evaluate the following missions as directed in the FY08 NDAA:  testing support, training support to receiving aircraft, homeland defense support, deployment support, air bridge support, aeromedical evacuation, and emergency air refueling.  Additional missions may be incorporated as Air Force requirements are established.

Intermittent assignments can normally be expected to range in duration from three to six weeks in support of existing tax projects.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) seeks to identify, and obtain information from, responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the electric distribution (NAICS 221122) at McGuire Air Force Base (AFB), New Jersey. Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.
Contractor will be required to assume ownership of the electric distribution system at McGuire AFB, New Jersey, and as the new owner, shall operate and maintain the system and provide utility services to the Government.  Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility systems.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter Notice) is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.  Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 4:00 pm on Monday, February 25, 2008.  Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:  (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business).  The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Government?s use as a market research tool.  As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the March-April 2008 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.  Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS
I.  DEVELOPMENT OF MARINE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM (MTS) TO ADVANCE THE EXISTING MARITIME INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK {Thursday, 1 May 2008}
The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Maritime Administration intends to acquire on a Sole Source Basis the highly specialized services for the development of Marine View ( hereinafter referred to as "MarView") that are deemed to be available only from Applied Enterprise Solutions, LLC (doing business as and hereinafter referred to as "AES").  
This is being pursued on a sole source basis because the Maritime Administration believes AES is the only known source that can demonstrate the proven ability to perform successfully in all aspects of the project; AES has developed and built the entire MarView architecture and framework; AES has developed the conceptual hardware architecture for MarView; and, AES worked with the Government and vendors to procure, build and implement the physical architecture.  
In addition, AES originally developed every software build and release of MarView functionality and has performed the majority of the operation and maintenance of the MarView system.

II. OVERVIEW:  MarView is currently set to release the next iteration in May of 2008. This release and subsequent releases will be the most critical to MarView's success. The detailed requirements, complex developments coupled by the high visibility MarView has gained makes highlights the critical nature of these releases. These areas introduce significant challenges that require a contractor with extensive experience and knowledge of previously developed processes, tools, and lessons learned.

III. BACKGROUND:  MarView is essentially a research-type project.  The overall objective of MarView is to provide electronic access (via portal technologies) to maritime data that is fused from numerous sources to enable better decision-making relative to the Marine Transportation System (MTS).  
The MarView Pilot was a preliminary release of functions and capabilities that currently exist within the Maritime Administration utilizing some automated facilities that have been previously developed and released on other projects.  This effort allowed end users to have a tangible sample of what MarView will provide, based on existing, well defined data sources and queries.  This version was used to communicate with stakeholders and users based on the functionality of the system, while also enabling research into technologies that can be used to easily integrated data from disparate systems and sources in a timely and cost efficient way. 
The MarView Live release is the initial fielding of the public release version of the MarView solution.  The results of the pilot, combined with the functional requirements captured and analysis of technological solutions generates the design for the MarView solution.  This design is implemented and fielded based on stakeholder driven requirements and business value delivered.

Awards will be made to the responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, price and other factors considered.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.  

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 with a small business size stand of $31 million.  

This contract will have no pre-established fixed contract prices. Each contract will consist of a base year, extending 365 calendar days from the date of the award and four (4) additional one-year duration options to be issued at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Combining base and option years, the potential duration for this contract is five years.
 
The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer who will issue written task orders to the contractor.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice   Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH) in the Southwest Region (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX) The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Jan Slick, 817-886-1050; or by e-mail at errette.j.slick@usace.army.mil. FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presenc e Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to sup port ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardi zation (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has be en assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT) facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.   SCOPE OF WORK:   Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), or other similar facilities:  UEPH facilities will house single soldiers and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to apartment type housing in the private sector.  The soldiers room s hall include, but not be limited to: private sleeping areas, walk-in closets, a shared bathroom and kitchenette.  Additional facility and functional support amenities shall be provided as outlined in the project Scope of Work.  The varying components for t his facility will be: building occupancy requirements, regional soils and climatic conditions, facility structural considerations, HVAC systems, and the exterior architectural features.  Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary a s required to meet project specific requirements.  It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task order s at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders.   CONTRACT INFORMATION:   This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonst rating their  capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will selec t no more than 5 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process.   In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criter ia described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Gover nment, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Govern ment will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.   The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Phase I  Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Appr oach   Phase II  Volume I: Building Functional and Aesthetics; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; Site Design; and Sustainability Requirements.

<DESC>The Virginia Contracting Activity (VaCA), on behalf of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), intends to award a Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ); type contract for Senior Engineering Technical Advisors (SETA) contract support to provide consistent senior-level information technology support across the Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS) enterprise. The following three support areas have been set-aside for small business: Enterprise Capability Innovations Support, Enterprise Operations and Maintenance and Conferences Coordination and Support. These areas have also been identified in the Statement of Objectives; Large businesses are precluded from submitting proposals for these areas. Small businesses may submit proposals for the entire SOO requirement or the three areas set-aside for small businesses. Contractors are advised that this may result in two separate awards.The scope of work and support includes activities that span the Information Management/Information Technology lifecycle. Presently they include: enterprise, portfolio, and program management; innovative thought leadership; senior engineering and technical assistance for design, prototype, development, systems assurance and certification, testing, integration, and deployment; operations and maintenance or replacement, and conference coordination and support. The Contractor Support Team (CST) will provide liaison, coordination, and support functions within and across Combatant Commands, J2s, partner Agencies, and Regional Service Centers (RSC) to ensure all within the DoDIIS Enterprise are sufficiently and consistently represented. These efforts will require a mixture of labor categories to fulfill the government?s requirements. As DoDIIS mission needs and requirements evolve and change, the government may require additional labor categories to meet the needs of the DoDIIS mission. A Top Secret Facility Clearance is required, in addition to providing qualified personnel that posse Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) clearance. This effort involves support to a Directorate at the strategic level. Contractors will be involved in the development and execution of plans and strategies that directly impact on going contracts and future acquisitions.
