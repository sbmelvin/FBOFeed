<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: -3.6pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The USAID/Ethiopia is considering the award of a competitive new contract to interest parties in an amount of $3,000,000 for the procurement of insecticide for indoor residual spraying of household activities (IRS) under the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). The award date will be o/a July 30, 2010.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: -3.6pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The purpose of this procurement is to </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Courier New'">support Ethiopia's National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), more specifically to support IRS in Oromia Regional State. </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Approximately 75% of Ethiopia's landmass is endemic for malaria, with malaria primarily associated with altitude and rainfall. In general, the peak of malaria incidence follows the main rainfall season (July - September) each year. However, many areas in the south and west of the country have a rainfall season beginning earlier in April and May or have no clearly defined rainfall season. Depending on these rainfall patterns, transmission tends to be highly heterogenous geo-spatially within each year as well as between years. Additionally, malaria in Ethiopia is characterized by widespread epidemics occurring every 5-8 years, with the most recent one between 2003 and 2005. In 2007/2008, malaria was the first cause of outpatient visits, health facility admissions and in-patient deaths, accounting for 12% of out-patient visits and 9.9% of admissions. </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Since 2007, the U.S. Government has supported malaria prevention and control activities in Ethiopia through PMI [<a href="http://www.pmi.gov/">http://www.pmi.gov</a>].

This is known as an "automatic stay" and it mirrors the stay required under a timely post-award protest to the GAO under 31 U.S. Code 3553(c) and FAR 33.104(c) (a "Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stay"). However, if the agency determines that performance must proceed, based upon the criteria set forth in FAR 33.103(f)(1), the automatic stay may be overridden. This is known as an automatic stay "override."</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">(3) The JCC-I/A voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract when an interested party files a timely protest under the JCC-I/A Agency Protest Program. Should the interested party disagree with the Contracting Officer's or RCC/Division Chief's resolution of an Agency Protest, it may appeal to the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC) or utilize another protest forum. The JCC-I/A Voluntary Automatic Stay extends the protester's right to preserve the status quo pending resolution of all protests with respect to a particular contract action. In return for the protester's initially filing its protest as an Agency Protest instead of with the GAO, the contracting officer agrees that, if the protester ultimately disagrees with the Contracting Officer or RCC/Division Chief's decision and files a GAO protest, the agency will agree not to proceed with performance just as it would have done if the protester had filed its protest with the GAO right from the start. This means that in an Agency Protest, the</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">agency may override the stay under the same standards and circumstances as would have applied if the protest had originally been filed with the GAO. Nothing in this provision adversely affects an interested party's rights to protest a contract action to the GAO, or to seek other relief related to the action.</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">(4) However, an appeal and review of the Contracting Officer's Agency Protest decision by the PARC will not extend the GAO's timeliness requirements. Therefore, any subsequent protest to the GAO must be filed within 10 days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's Agency Protest decision.</span></p>
