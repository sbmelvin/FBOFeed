<DESC>The US Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Directorate, Ground Based Strategic Deterrent Division (AFNWC/NIC) is contemplating a sole source award(s) to potentially all prospective prime contractors who anticipate submitting a formal proposal for the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) contract.
<p>AFNWC/NIC continues to engage with industry and has been conducting extensive market research since FY14. This research aids in understanding industry's capabilities and developing the GBSD acquisition strategy and key TMRR documents. The TMRR objective is to conclude with a preliminary design and functional baseline leading up to a competition for the development/production phase. AFNWC/NIC is now seeking to enter into sole source contracts with potential future GBSD prime TMRR contractors to accelerate maturation of documentation and methodologies for communication between potential Prime Contractors and the System Program Office. This will provide the program management team with the ability to manage budget expectations with contract scope and streamline the dissemination of information, specifically regarding the sharing of classified materials. The expected period of performance will be a three (3) month base period and approximately three (3) one-month options.</p>
<p>No agreements, promises or other commitments are made or implied by the Government. The Government is not responsible or liable for expenditures incurred as the result of this posting.</p>
<p>Please respond via email to the POC below with your intentions to submit a proposal for the GBSD TMRR request for proposal along with your interest in a short term contract to evaluate and analyze specific requirements documents NLT Thursday, 5 November 2015 at 1400 MST.</p>

<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) has a requirement to conduct scientific research to understand the effects of spaceflight conditions on the skeleton, specifically, high force exercise (like squats) while in a simulated weightless environment.  One of the standard techniques is bone histomorphometry, a set of measurements that allow bone researchers to determine how fast osteoblast cells can form new bone and how fast osteoclast cells can resorb it.  One specialized technique required is staining for and quantifying small micro-cracks and diffuse damage present in the bone (collectively named micro-damage). <P> NASA/ARC intends to purchase services from the Bone and Signaling lab from Indiana University, School of Medicine, Bone Biology Laboratory, under the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Market research shows that Indiana University is the only known entity that has the ability to assess micro-damage in bone, which is an extremely specialized technique.	No commercial vendors were found who could perform the requirements. <P> The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. <P> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. Pacific Time on November 13, 2015. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. <P> Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. <P> All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. <P> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at <A HREF="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html">http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/p ub_library/Omb.html </A>     Information about major upcoming ARC procurement actions is available at <A HREF="http://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eis/admin/admin.cgi?">http://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-b in/eis/admin/admin.cgi? </A>

<p>TYPE OF SET-ASIDE:&nbsp; unrestricted</p>
<p>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>

<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>GUIS Opal Beach Parking Lot/Road Removal

SYNOPSIS: The Gulf Islands National Seashore (GUIS), a unit of the National Park Service (NPS), has a requirement for the removal of two remnant, abandoned parking lots and associated road segments at the South Opal Beach and North Opal Beach in Northwest Florida.  On or about November 16th the Government intends to issue an invitation to bid (IFB) for a single, firm-fixed price contract for dismantling, demolition, or removal of improvements.  This beach enhancement restoration project will restore the natural viewshed to improve visitors' experience.   

LOCATION: Opal Beach Area of Gulf Islands National Seashore is situated on Santa Rosa Island along J. Earle Bowden Way (State Road 399), which connects eastern Pensacola Beach to Navarre Beach, Florida.  The project area is bordered by sensitive habitat and two wetlands.

SUMMARY: The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment and incidentals necessary to perform the excavation, loading and removal activities (to include hauling and dumping) a combined surface area of approximately 1.75 acres. All construction and demolition (C&D) debris shall be transported in a secure manner for off-site disposal or recycling.
  
C&D is defined in 62-701.200 (25) Florida Administrative Code 62-701.200 Definitions.
(25) "Construction and demolition debris" means discarded materials generally considered to be not water soluble and non-hazardous in nature, including but not limited to steel, glass, brick, concrete, asphalt material, pipe, gypsum wallboard, and lumber, from the construction or destruction of a structure as part of a construction or demolition project or from the renovation of a structure, including such debris from construction of structures at a site remote from the construction or demolition project site. The term includes rocks, soils, tree remains, trees, and other vegetative matter which normally results from land clearing or land development operations for a construction project; clean cardboard, paper, plastic, wood, and metal scraps from a construction project; effective January 1, 1997, except as provided in Section 403.707(13)(j), F.S., unpainted, non-treated wood scraps from facilities manufacturing materials used for construction of structures or their components and unpainted, non-treated wood pallets provided the wood scraps and pallets are separated from other solid waste where generated and the generator of such wood scraps or pallets implements reasonable practices of the generating industry to minimize the commingling of wood scraps or pallets with other solid waste; and de minimis amounts of other nonhazardous wastes that are generated at construction or demolition projects, provided such amounts are consistent with best management practices of the construction and demolition industries. Mixing of construction and demolition debris with other types of solid waste will cause it to be classified as other than construction and demolition debris.

Debris from a construction or demolition project that meets the current definition of C&D waste can be disposed in a C&D landfill or Material Recovery Facility.  The preferred option for managing any type of solid waste is to reuse or recycle the waste, whenever feasible.  Nonhazardous C&D debris is not federally regulated by EPA.  State and local regulations may limit where C&D debris can be disposed and may also require recycling a minimum percentage of the C&D debris generated. Visit www.cicacenter.org for more information.

DESCRIPTION: Work consists of the removal of debris in estimated quantities specified in the contract documents, which may include one or more of the following:

-	A 10-20-pp. Workplan prepared by the Contractor that briefly describes project schedule, roles and responsibilities, removal and disposal methodology, safety protocols, etc.

<DESC>THIS IS AN UNRESTRICTED COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR SUBPART 6.1 FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. This procurement will use the two-phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation covering both phases. Source Selection procedures will be used with the intent to award a firm-fixed price construction contract to the responsible Offeror whose proposal, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the Government.

The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for the design and construction of P-222 E-LMR Slice Communication Towers at Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center (MCMWTC) Bridgeport, California.
 The project includes the design and construction of five new E-LMR communication towers in various locations throughout the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center Bridgeport area. Each communication tower will be constructed as a standalone facility in remote locations within the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Towers will range from 70 to 150 feet in height and each tower will consist of a foundation, propane generator, solar panels and batteries, equipment shelter, fence and associated support features like halo grounding, ice bridge system and propane tanks.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237130, and the annual size standard is $36.5 million. The estimated price range for design and construction is between $10,000,000 and $15,000,000.

The Government intends to evaluate proposals without discussions.
 The tradeoff process is selected as appropriate for this acquisition. The Government considers it to be in its best interest to allow consideration of award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following: Phase One: Factor 1  Technical Approach, Factor 2  Experience, Factor 3  Past Performance, Factor 4  Safety; Phase 2: Factor 5  Technical Solution, Factor 6  Small Business Utilization, 6A  Past Performance in Utilization of Small Business Concerns, 6B  Small Business Participation, Factor 7  Price.

The Phase One evaluation will result in a determination of the most highly qualified Offerors.
 These Offerors will be requested to submit a Phase Two proposal. A maximum of five Offerors will be selected to submit a Phase Two proposal unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than five is in the Governments interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of two-phase design-build contracting.

THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The Phase One RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at www.neco.navy.mil on or about 15 October 2015. No hard copies will be provided. IT IS THE CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THE SOLICITATION.

Prospective Offerors MUST register themselves on the website.
 Plan holders lists will not be faxed and will be available only at the website listed above.

A pre-proposal conference for Phase One will not be held. A pre-proposal presentation and document with frequently asked questions will be posted along with the solicitation on www.neco.navy.mil for your review.

<DESC>1. Pursuant to FAR 13.106-1 (b) "Soliciting from a single source". The National Research Council of the National Academy of Science (NAS) derives its long-established status as a non-competitive source of scientific research and policy advice to the Government from its creation by Congress in 1863 (36 U.S.C. Sec. 253). This special status and relationship with the Government was reconfirmed by Executive Order (E.O.) 2859, May 11, 1918, as amended by E.O. 10668, May 10, 1956. The noncompetitive status of the Academy was most recently formally affirmed in E.O. 12832 on January 19, 1993. This order cites the special relationship of the Academy to the Government and its unique capacity to marshal scientific expertise of the highest caliber in order to provide independent and objective science policy advice.<br /><br />NAS is a unique national resource situated to harness the Nation's most eminent scholars and expertise from around the country without compensation on committees and boards and provide insight and advice on pressing science and technology policy questions. It brings together leaders from academe, industry, government, and other sectors to address critical national issues and provide cogent, unbiased advice to the government and citizens of the United States. The institution has developed an array of approaches for addressing the variety of problems and policy questions that come before it. The end products take many forms: among them, written reports reflecting the deliberations and conclusions of an expert study committee; symposia and other opportunities for decision-makers to discuss national issues; proceedings from conferences and workshops; and "white papers" on policy issues of special interest. Most projects are conducted or overseen by a committee with a diverse range of expertise covering all aspects of the subject.
<p>With unparalleled objectivity, NAS is uniquely qualified to provide the measure of Expertise, independence and audience acceptance necessary to meet the program requirements. NAS stands alone in its level of expertise and capacity required to complete the proposed study on the ethical and social policy issues raised by the recent development of novel methods to develop a collaborative, information technology laboratory capability that facilitates systems research, technology development, testing, and evaluation related to public alerts and warnings. <br />Literature review and discussion with Government program officials and private industry consistently identify the NAS as uniquely capable of performing this requirement.</p>
<p>2. Determination and Period of Performance:<br />Given the complexity of the issues from regulatory, scientific and financial perspectives, the NAS is the only organization that can access leading medical, scientific, bioethicist and regulatory expertise while maintaining objectivity and independence which is required for this effort. A time and materials order will be negotiated and awarded under the PSC ordering agreement with the National Academy of Sciences. The anticipated period of performance shall be for eighteen (18) months from date of award.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform this requirement.</p>
<p>3. Background, Strategy and Scope: <br />DHS S&amp;T established the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Program within the First Responders Group Office for Interoperability and Compatibility, herein after referred to as FRG OIC, to develop a collaborative, information technology laboratory capability that facilitates systems research, technology development, testing, and evaluation related to public alerts and warnings. The WEA RDT&amp;E Program faces the organizational challenge of aligning the efforts of a diverse research community in the public and private sectors with specific legislative mandates and national security goals.</p>
<p>3.1 Strategy for the Objective: <br />The purpose of this sole source contract is to assemble a committee of approximately 12 experts across relevant disciplines, including technologists, social scientists, and emergency managers who would be appointed by the National Research Council to carry out this study. That committee would meet approximately 4-5 times over the course of 12 months to obtain briefings, deliberate, and prepare a consensus report.</p>
<p>3.2 Tactics to Achieve the Objective:<br />The NAS has convened three workshops under DHS sponsorship, one focused on alerting on cell phones, one considering the use of social media, and one looking at geographical targeting of alerts and warnings. The proposed activity would draw, in part, on this earlier work and on results from DHS-sponsored research.</p>
<p>3.3 Scope:<br />This effort is comprised of a review of current knowledge about how to effectively deploy and use emergency alerts and warnings and explore future research needs. A workshop and additional information-gathering meetings will be convened to capture results from recent research to include work sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate and to foster dialog among technologists, social science researchers, and emergency managers. The study committee's report would summarize results from the DHS research, provide an overview of current knowledge about emergency alerts and warnings, and set forth an interdisciplinary agenda for research that would highlight gaps and future needs. This effort cannot be obtained as conveniently or economically by contracting directly with the private sector because the work is better suited for the Federal Government and academia, which has, over the past number of years, been working with key researchers in this area.</p>
<p>4. Board Director: <br />Must be a recognized industry expert possessing a doctor of medicine, doctor of philosophy or equivalent degree and possess extensive experience in conducting similar projects that establish an evidence base for sourcing an emergency alerts and warning platform. The candidate must have at least 15 years of experience in a medical/scientific discipline and must be generally known for his or her experience through published articles/scholarly works; oral presentations at seminars, conferences and peer groups; or through other widely known venues.</p>
<p>5. The Study Committee: <br />The contractor will appoint a Steering Committee of between 11 and 13 experts across relevant disciplines, including technologists, social scientists, and emergency managers to include a chair or chairs. This committee will meet four to five times, either in person or by teleconference, over the course of 18 months to obtain briefings, deliberate, and prepare a consensus report. Committee reports will be created following each meeting.</p>
<p>5.1 Study Kickoff Meeting: DHS S&amp;T's First Responders Group (FRG) Office for Interoperability and Compatibility (OIC) will be invited to present and discuss its goals and expectations to the committee. An initial set of briefers will provide the study committee with background and context. The contractor will consult with FRG OIC regarding these briefings. The committee will begin planning for the workshop and subsequent activities. A Plan of Action and Milestones will be created. Regular meeting reports will be delivered.</p>
<p>5.2 Workgroup Meetings: The workshop will include several keynote speakers to provide an overall framing of issues and several panels to present and discuss current and potential technology solutions, research, and open questions. A closing session will include summary remarks by panel moderators and time for open discussion. The workshop will involve approximately 20 invited speakers and another 25 invited participants, and will be open to the public on a space-available basis. The contractor will consult with FRG OIC for its input on proposed speakers and panelists prior to inviting them to participate. Additionally, the contractor will keep FRG OIC apprised of speaker and panelist acceptances or denials and discuss any replacements that may be necessary.</p>
<p>5.3 The contractor will engage with speakers and panelists ahead of the workshop to ensure that presentations are aligned with the workshop goals and discussion topics. Speakers and panelists will be recognized experts in the fields of information and communications technologies, services, and applications; geographic information; public safety and homeland security.</p>
<p>5.4 Following the workshop, the contractor will make an unedited transcript of the workshop available to the public as well as provide a copy of the transcript to OIC within approximately 30 days of the event.</p>
<p>6. Prepare Final Report. As a check on the quality and objectivity of the study, all contractor reports would undergo a rigorous, independent external review by experts whose comments are provided anonymously to the committee members. The contractor recruits independent experts with a range of views and perspectives to review and comment on the draft report prepared by the committee. Once the final report experts complete that review process, it will be delivered to the DHS S&amp;T Contracting Officer via email, transmitted to FRG OIC, and made available to the public shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>7. This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>8. All responsible sources that have the requisite qualifications to perform the work above may submit a statement of capabilities via e-mail to mary.fouser@psc.hhs.gov, which will be will be reviewed solely to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<RESPDATE>082615
<CONTACT>Kimberly F Hubbard, 3128465368

<a href="mailto:kimberly.f.hubbard@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Chicago</a>
<DESC>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is being issued by the United States Army Corps of Engineers - Chicago District to inform interested/potential contractors of the District's imminent issue of a Sole Source Solicitation for its construction project, entitled PARKING SPACES FOR USACE'S LEASED GSA VEHICLE FLEET - CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.   <br>  <br> PROJECT INFORMATION: LEASED PARKING SPACES Project is establish a follow-on firm-fixed price commercial items purchase order with Interpark, LLC (the incumbent contractor) for the continuation of rental services at its parking garage.  This would allow for the safe and secure parking of the Chicago District's leased General Services Administration (GSA) vehicles, currently being utilized by the Operations Technical Support Section.  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) - Chicago District requires eight (8)RESERVED parking stalls and one (1) unreserved parking stall at the Contractor's location CH616 (326 S. Wells, Chicago, IL. ) for the GSA vehicles being leased by the USACE. Two of the vehicles are extra large sized pickup trucks; therefore, the parking facility must have a minimum overhead clearance of seven (7) feet as well as adequate safe turning radius in order for vehicles to safely navigate the parking facility. The location of these parking stalls must be within a secure and enclosed location with unlimited access to the USACE's employees and the interchangeability of the USACE's Vehicles. <br>  <br> REASONS FOR AUTORITY CITED:   <br>  <br> Under the previously awarded Purchase Order W912P6-14-M-0018, rental services for parking stalls were procured by contracting with Interpark, LLC.  The award resulted from Solicitation Number W912P6-13-Q-0037, wherein only one response was received, that of Interpark, LLC.   These contracted services of a-12 month duration, allows the USACE to rent 8 RESERVED parking stalls, and one unreserved. <br>  <br> By utilizing the same contractor, the government's vehicles would be parked in a safe enclosed location with all the requirements being met with respect to proximity to District Headquarters, minimum overhead clearance of seven (7) feet, as well as adequate safe turning radius in order for vehicles to safely navigate the parking facility. For the purposes of continuity, efficiency, quality control, and cost effectiveness, the government seeks to contract with the incumbent contractor for these services.  <br>  <br> Any other contractor awarded this contract, other than Interpark, would pose unacceptable risks per the following FAR criteria: <br>  <br> (a)	With the numerous facilities of the incumbent Contractor, it has the ability to accommodate the number of Chicago District's vehicles at fair and reasonable prices, coupled with meeting all the required parking criteria.  In consideration of its parking facility being within a reasonable walking distance from the District and it being equipped with the number of parking stalls needed, the government would exhaust substantial resources in preparing the request for quote and evaluating/selecting a new contractor that may not have the right facility, availability, or be within a close proximity to the District.  If the employees aren't able to walk a reasonable distance from the District to the parking facility, it would require them to purchase transportation; thus, driving up overhead costs to be absorbed by the District's budget.  Furthermore, if a contractor were to place a lower quote, its location may be substantially farther away from the District, requiring transportation fees to and from that location on top of the parking fees, resulting in a spike in overall costs.   Such costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. Thus,  a contract award to other than Interpark, LLC would almost certainly involve duplication of costs, and increased overhead cost when it is likely only one contractor would be able to satisfy the government's needs, that of the incumbent contractor.   <br>  <br> (b)	If the contract were to go out for competition, additional time would be required to prepare the RFQ and evaluate potential contractors.  Additionally, if a new contractor were selected, it would likely not have the necessary number of stalls available in a timely manner, leaving the vehicles without a safe and secure parking facility.  Because of the upfront acquisition time needed, completing this effort within a timely manner is critical for multiple reasons. If the spaces are forfeited at the current facility owned by the incumbent contractor, these spaces may be taken by the time the RFQ undergoes an advertisement period.  If no other parking facilities are able to meet the government's requirements or not willing to compete for the award, then unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements would be encountered. <br>  <br> In consideration of the foregoing, these services are deemed available from the original source, Interpark, LLC due to unacceptable risks. It is imperative that strict parking provisions be complied with to allow the USACE to properly maintain the GSA's vehicles while under lease agreement with the GSA.  Furthermore, the incumbent contractor has the spaces readily available for use and is willing to establish a new contract by the needed date of 30 August 2016, all within the parameters of the USACE's parking provisions.  Under its current contract, the vendor is supplying the required parking stalls in a safe and secured enclosed garage, which is within a reasonable walking distance from the District office; and, it is having no issues satisfying these requirements with fair and reasonable pricing.    <br>  <br> CONTRACTING OFFICE NEW LOCATION: USACE District, Chicago - 231 SOUTH La SALLE SUITE 1500, Chicago, IL 60604, (effective the date of this notice) <br>  <br> PROJECT LOCATION: The Leased Parking Spaces Site is located at (CH616) 326 S. Wells Chicago, IL and lies in Cook County. <br>  <br> The contract type for this acquisition is a firm fixed price services. <br> This notice is not a formal solicitation or request for proposal. <br>  <br> This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers, proposals, etc.  However, interested firms may send a capabilities statement NO LATER THAN the close of business on 26 August 2015.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT
1.	GENERAL INFORMATION
1.1.	This is a performance-based contract for cemetery grounds maintenance services at Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery, Dallas, Texas and hereafter referred to as DFW or "Cemetery."  The overall responsibility of the Contractor is to plan, coordinate, organize, manage, and perform the activities of mowing and trimming; trimming around headstones, edging around flat markers; curb/sidewalk edging; weed control; providing fertilizer; and associated services described herein required to maintain a healthy and aesthetic appearance of the Cemetery grounds.  The Cemetery is located at 2000 Mountain Creek Parkway, Dallas, Texas, 75211.
1.2.	This Performance Work Statement describes the basic objectives of the Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery Grounds Maintenance Program. The Performance Based Service Contract provides potential Offerors the flexibility to develop cost effective solutions and the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives to meet the stated objectives. It also presents the Government with an opportunity to assess the Offeror's understanding of all aspects of the effort to be performed by eliminating the "how to" instructions to accomplish the required effort normally contained on the Statement of Work that the Government traditionally provides to prospective Offerors. Minimum acceptable levels of performance to meet the minimum requirements are outlined in the "Services Delivery Summary" contained in Attachment 1. 
1.3.	The National Cemetery Administration Mission.
1.3.1.	The National Cemetery Administration honors veterans with a final resting place and lasting memorial that commemorate their service to our Nation. National Cemeteries are National Shrines. Therefore, the standards for management, maintenance, appearance and operational procedures performed by the Contractor have been established by the National Cemetery Administration to reflect this Nations' concern and respect for those interred there. For this reason, the Contractor's strict adherence to the Performance Work Statement, Performance Work Requirements Summary and Guidance Specifications shall be required and shall be essential.
1.4.	Background.
1.4.1.	In 1999 Congress passed legislation requiring VA to ensure that National Cemeteries serve as a dignified and respectful setting. Each Cemetery is to be an expression of appreciation and respect of a grateful Nation for the service and sacrifice of her veterans. 
1.4.2.	Further, each National Cemetery is to be maintained as a National Shrine. A National Shrine is defined as a place of honor and memory that declares to the visitor/family who views it as a majestic setting, offering a sense of serenity, historic sacrifice and nobility of purpose. The National Cemetery is a beautiful and awe-inspiring tribute to those who gave much to preserve our Nation's freedom and way of life.
2.	DESCRIPTION OF CONTRACT OBJECTIVES
2.1.	The Contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, professional expertise, vehicles, tools, equipment, materials, and services necessary to ensure that grounds maintenance is performed in a manner that shall meet or exceed the requirements to maintain healthy turf grass and that presents a clean, neat, professional and aesthetic grounds appearance throughout the Cemetery. The Contractor's performance will be based on the Contracting Officer's (CO) and Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) evaluation and of the results required by the Service Delivery Summary (SDS) and not the method of performance. It is at the Contractor's discretion to determine the methods to attain the level of service at the best value. The evaluation of results will be based on COR performance assessment, tenant satisfaction, and customer complaints. Final results of the evaluations will be the determining factor for the success or failure of this contract. The Contractor shall comply with applicable federal, regional, state, local laws, and commercial standards. 
2.2.	Services include, but are not limited to, mowing, trimming (features and headstones), edging (features and flat markers), weed control, providing fertilizer, removal of trash (generated by the Contractor), as well as sweeping or blowing off grass from sidewalks, roads and headstones. Scheduling of services shall be coordinated with the COR to avoid disruption of ongoing Cemetery operations. All work shall be done during normal Federal workdays during Cemetery workday hours. The exception is Memorial Day, which may be a workday for Federal employees, but not for the Contractor. No work shall be allowed during special weekend activities.
2.3.	The Contractor shall be responsible for full management of the facility's grounds maintenance services described herein. The Government's objectives are described in the NCA's "Operational Standards and Measures" (given upon request of the Contracting Officer), the Performance Work Statement (PWS), and other requirements identified herein, as they are applicable to the services required in the Pricing Schedule. The Contractor shall develop a "Performance Work Plan" that contains solutions to accomplish the Government's objectives. The Contractor may use whatever method it chooses to meet the objectives, as long as the end result satisfies the minimum acceptable levels of performance as defined in Services Delivery Summary (SDS). 
2.4.	Contract Objectives.
2.4.1.	To use an innovative and creative technical approach to manage the Cemetery grounds maintenance operation at the Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery in order to maintain the high standards of appearance as a National Shrine, in accordance with best commercial practices and the requirements identified in this solicitation.
2.4.2.	To have the Contractor perform to its Technical Performance Approach focused on criteria designed to maintain healthy grass and a clean, neat and professional grounds appearance overall.
2.4.3.	The minimum life of the contract is planned for one base period with up to four (4) one- year options individually exercised at the VA's discretion and dependent on the availability of funds.
3.	DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES:
3.1.	Improved Grounds Mowing. The Contractor shall mow all Improved Grounds to look well-manicured, with a neat and professional appearance at all times.  Improved Grounds are visually prominent and medium visual impact areas requiring more frequent maintenance, such as burial areas, high visibility specialty areas, and non-burial areas (see Attachment 6, Definitions). All Improved Grounds shall be maintained in the same manner as a high quality residential lawn under contract from a professional lawn maintenance service. This generally requires a complete mow/trim cycle every week during the growing season (April through September).  Mowed areas shall be uniform in appearance, free of skips, gaps, scalping, rutting, bruising, and uneven and rough cutting.
3.1.1.	The Contractor shall maintain grass height at a height within one (1) inch (+/-) of that which is professionally recommended for the recommended grass type for the Dallas-Fort Worth geographic region and as directed by the COR. Optimally, the height should be no more than one-half an inch (") above the recommended range for the type of turf at the Cemetery as directed by the COR. The typical acceptable height ranges between 1 and 3 inches; however, the COR, with input from the Memorial Service Network (MSN) Agronomist, may direct the Contractor on the particular height to mow at any given time depending on weather conditions. 
3.1.2.	The Contractor shall be required to pick up, collect and dispose of debris and trash (see Attachment 6, Definitions), natural and manmade, prior to and after mowing/trimming any area.
3.1.3.	The Contractor shall identify, move and replace all floral or commemorative items, etc. to their original locations as necessary while performing mowing/trimming services. 
3.1.4.	The Contractor shall keep all headstones, flat markers, monuments, roadways, walkways (inside and out), flagpole bases, public visitor areas including at the Committal Shelter, or other non-turf areas free of clipping or edging deposits.  Clippings shall be mechanically blown or swept onto nearby turf areas when possible, or collected and disposed of on the same day as the mowing, trimming, or edging event that produced them. At no time is freshly mowed grass to be blown onto headstones
3.1.5.	The Contractor shall immediately remove and dispose of, or mulch clearly visible clumps of grass clippings on top of the turf to prevent the appearance of windrows.
3.1.6.	The Contractor shall use commercial grade rear-discharge mowers or commercial grade mowers with mulching decks only. The Contractor shall use properly maintained and adjusted cutting equipment to prevent streaks or irregularities, uneven cutting, plowing, or gouging of the soil. Cutting blades on mowing and trimming equipment must be kept sharp so that grass tips are cleanly cut and not torn or damaged. Riding mowers may be used if they are not operated within two (2) inches of markers, monuments, tree trunks or other vertical surfaces.
3.1.7.	All mowing equipment shall be cleaned before unloading or mowing at the Cemetery to reduce the risk of introducing contaminant weed seeds into the Cemetery turf. No equipment shall be cleaned on Cemetery property.
3.1.8.	The Contractor shall hand mow new seed/sod areas (present at all newly buried gravesites, second interment gravesites, and repaired gravesite locations) until they are fully established to the point where they will not be damaged by riding mowers.
3.1.9.	The Contractor shall be familiar with and utilize different mowing patterns and shall change direction, change patterns, and vary mower wheel width patterns after each mowing thereby reducing turf wear, prevent wheel rutting, and provide a neater appearance. All mowing around trees will be accomplished in a manner that prevents a "ringing pattern" around the tree and associated damage to turf.
3.1.10.	There may be periods of excessive rainfall when the Contractor cannot access areas for mowing due to excessive wetness. The COR has the authority to stop work if weather conditions are such that work that day will do more damage than good to the Cemetery grounds. During these periods, the Contractor shall be expected to ensure the grass is cut in less than a week's time once grass is suitable for mowing.
3.2.	Trimming. The Contractor shall trim grass and vegetation around vertical surfaces or any other structure or area that cannot be maintained by traditional mowing equipment to match surrounding area grass height within Improved Grounds. Streaks or irregularities, uneven cutting, plowing, or gouging of the soil is unacceptable. The vertical surfaces to be trimmed include headstones, flat markers, section markers, monuments, trees, planting beds, shrubs, buildings, curbs/curbing, fences, walls, poles, signs, fire hydrants, parking lot bumper blocks, boulders, utility/valve boxes and covers.
3.2.1.	The Contractor shall trim turfgrass surrounding headstones and flat markers to its recommended height for the type of turf at the Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery after each mowing cycle.
3.2.2.	The Contractor shall trim all areas concurrent with mowing. Trimming operations of all non-mowed turf areas shall be considered a part of mowing. The Contractor shall mow first, followed by trimming.
3.2.3.	The Contractor shall remove or mulch grass clippings when visible after trimming, before leaving work area.
3.2.4.	The Contractor shall exercise caution to avoid contact with headstones, markers, monuments, building walls, trees, shrubs, flowers, any other desirable plant materials, etc. or any other structure than can be damaged by contact with the trimming device's cutting instrument.
3.2.5.	The Contractor shall use commercial grade power trimmers and power edgers to trim grass from around headstones, flat markers, monuments, section markers, etc. The Contractor shall use trimmers with a plastic blade attachment to cleanly trim edges around all headstones and flat markers, monuments, section markers, etc. or as otherwise approved by the COR.
3.3.	Feature Edging.  The Contractor shall blade edge all streets, curbs, walkways, tree wells, permanent building/structure lines, and planting beds. Edging shall provide a clear zone " to 1" wide by 2" to 3" deep with all vegetation removed from joints and cracks. Damage to asphalt/concrete shall be avoided. Edging events shall be completed as ordered by the COR. The first edging cycle shall be completed approximately at the start of the mowing season, the second cycle one week prior to Memorial Day, the third during the month of July, and a fourth edging during the month of September. Additional edging events may be scheduled by the COR. The exact dates will be provided by the COR.
3.4.	Flat Marker Blade Edging.  The Contractor shall edge turf perpendicular to the outside perimeter (edge) of flat grave markers to remove all grass/vegetation that is growing around or over the entire outside perimeter of the flat grave markers during each mow/trim cycle. The depth of the vertical cut at the edge of the flat markers shall be 1" to 2" deep and the width of the cut shall not exceed ". There shall be a clean and neat vertical edge left around each flat marker. No metal blades shall be used to edge around flat markers. The Contractor shall exercise caution not to chip flat markers with blades.  Flat markers are grouped together in the same burial sections.
3.5.	Weed Control.  The Contractor shall control broadleaf and grassy weeds through execution of a weed control program appropriate for the area, in accordance with NCA Handbook 3410, Integrated Pest Management Procedures for VA National Cemeteries, and current federal, state, and local regulations.  The Contractor shall comply with all applicable parts of 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910, Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Standards; 29 CFR 1925, Labor, Safety and Health Standards for Federal Service Contracts; 40 CFR 150-189, Protection of Environment, Pesticide Program; and 49 CFR 171, Transportation, General Information, Regulations, and Definitions.
3.5.1.	The Contractor shall control weeds through broad and selective applications of herbicide. The herbicide program, in general, shall consist of two (2) pre-emergent herbicide applications and three (3) post-emergent herbicide applications per contract year. The table below serves as a guideline for when the herbicide applications shall be made:

Table 3.5. General Schedule for Herbicide Applications

4.3.3.	The Contractor Superintendent shall ensure all specifications are being met, ensure contract work does not conflict with ceremonies and funerals, and ensure employees are adequately supervised and proper conduct is maintained.
4.3.4.	The Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining satisfactory standards of personnel conduct and work performance and shall administer disciplinary action as required.

These Daily meetings are for the Contractor Superintendent to ask questions and ensure he/she understands the off-limit areas, which may vary depending on the event. The Contractor Superintendent can thus assign tasks accordingly throughout the rest of the Cemetery so that productive use of labor and equipment is assured, and downtime is avoided. If the Contractor Superintendent fails to re-direct employees away from an event in a timely fashion, the COR may then assist in doing so. 
4.5.2.	The Contractor Superintendent shall provide WEEKLY and DAILY work schedules to the COR. The Contractor is required to schedule all required services and is further required to comply with his schedule except for delays beyond his control. Such delays shall be coordinated through the COR. The work schedule shall include deficient work identified by Contractor's quality control inspections and not yet corrected.
4.5.3.	The Contractor shall submit the WEEKLY schedule every Friday by 3:00 P.M. indicating the work to be performed during the following week and the DAILY schedule shall be submitted on a daily basis by 8:00 A.M. indicating work being performed on that day.
4.5.4.	The Contractor Superintendent shall provide WEEKLY an accurate written report identifying all work that took place within the previous seven (7) calendar days. The Contractor shall document services performed, indicate the location where work was to be performed, and provide information to the COR as required. 
4.5.5.	A list of scheduled ceremonies will be provided to the Contractor Superintendent the week prior to the scheduled events, and a list of scheduled funerals will be provided daily. The Contractor Superintendent shall be solely responsible for ensuring that no contract work causes any funeral, ceremony, procession or visitation to be delayed, altered, or otherwise impacted in such a way that the dignity or security of the event is compromised. The Contractor shall be solely responsible for staying abreast of all such upcoming events and when in doubt, he/she must ask the COR. 
4.5.6.	The Contractor's performance and progress on this contract shall be measured weekly based on how timely, accurately, and adequately he/she accomplishes and completes the weekly work scheduled and as needed to systematically accomplish the contract work over the duration of the project. In instances where the COR determines that the work is behind schedule, he will notify the Contracting Officer and the Contractor shall increase workforce and/or hours of operation at no additional cost to the Government in order to achieve completion of the contract work within the specified timeframe. 

4.5.7.	SUBMITTALS - The Contractor shall submit the following documents or information in accordance with the table below.

4.6.	Performance Evaluation Meeting.
4.6.1.	The issuance of a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR) found at Attachment 4 may be cause for the scheduling of a meeting among the Contractor, CO, and the COR. A mutual effort will be made to resolve all problems identified. The Government will prepare written minutes of the meeting. The Contractor, CO, and the COR will sign minutes of the meeting(s).
4.6.2.	Should the Contractor not concur with the minutes, they shall so state their objections in writing to the Contracting Officer, within ten (10) calendar days, and also explain the reasons for non-concurrence.  The Contracting Officer will review and consider the reasons submitted for the Contractor's non-concurrence and make a decision to revise or uphold the comments as written. The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor of the decision in writing within ten (10) calendar days of submission of any objections.
4.7.	Actions.
4.7.1.	Normally, the COR will verbally advise or give a written inspection report to the Contractor of discrepancies the first time they occur and ask the Contractor to correct the problem. A notation will be made on the COR checklist of the date and the time the deficiency was discovered and the date and time the Contractor was notified.
4.7.2.	If the Government created any of the discrepancies, these will not be counted against the Contractor's performance. When the Government has caused the Contractor to perform in an unsatisfactory manner, the COR will forward a written notice to the responsible organizational element requesting corrective action be taken.
4.7.3.	When the Contractor is not meeting the acceptable limits of satisfactory performance, a CDR will be issued to the Contractor. The seriousness of the failures should govern whether to issue CDR at the end of the period, or as soon as work performance is less than satisfactory.
4.7.4.	When a CDR is issued for a service, the CO and/or the COR may exercise any contractual remedy available for non-performance, in accordance with FAR 52.212-4, "Inspection and Acceptance". 
4.7.5.	If the Contractor does not achieve satisfactory performance by the end of the next period or agreed suspense date, further actions may be considered, to include a determination on whether continued performance by the Contractor is feasible.   End PWS

<DESC>The purpose of SAFE is to reduce HIV mortality, morbidity and transmission, while improving nutrition outcomes and family planning integration in the six USAID-supported provinces. The SAFE contractor will primarily utilize a technical assistance approach to strengthen services at the district and facility level, and a direct service delivery model at the community level. SAFE activities are informed by analyses including gender, policy, and cost-effectiveness analyses, and consultation with the Zambian government, U.S. Government agencies, civil society, private sector, research institutions, donors and other stakeholders.
<p>In general, after five years of implementation, SAFE will have achieved its intended purpose by having:</p>
<p>&#9679;	Reached 80 percent of eligible HIV-positive adults and children with antiretroviral treatment across SAFE districts;<br />&#9679;	Reduced HIV-related deaths by 50 percent; <br />&#9679;	Improved the quality of life for HIV-infected people by maintaining viral suppression for 90 percent of beneficiaries on HIV treatment;<br />&#9679;	Lowered the incidence of new HIV infections by 50 percent;<br />&#9679;	Reached 90 percent of the HIV positive adults and children with NACS; and<br />&#9679;	Reduced wasting by 50 percent among HIV positive adults and children.</p>
<br /><br />USAID/ZAMBIA anticipates releasing the final RFP between November 13 - November 20, 2015.&nbsp;

<DESC>Title: Request for Information, Terrestrial Line of Sight Radio (LOS) Capability
<p>SIC Code: 3663<br />NAICS code: 334220</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the U.S. Government to a contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, the U.S. Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any RFP, if one is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen is seeking potential sources capable of manufacturing and delivering Terrestrial LOS Radios that are compatible with existing Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) systems and equipment. These radios are required to meet the initiatives of the Signal Modernization (SIGMOD) Program that will transform and augment the Army's communication capabilities and extend the network to lower echelons via modular, scalable and interoperable nodes. This Terrestrial Transmission capability is expected to augment Satellite Communications, the current primary connectivity between WIN-T increments, and resolve incompatibilities between existing terrestrial radios in those increments that create inefficiencies in the network detrimental to military operations. <br /><br />The Terrestrial LOS capability being sought is expected to be achieved via a high bandwidth, interoperable WIN-T Increment (Inc) 1 to Inc 2 network radio that will establish a terrestrial link for increased network robustness. The radio must possess greatly reduced Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) over the current At the Halt (ATH) LOS radio, the AN/GRC-245 radio used in the AN/TRC-190E(V)1 &amp; F(V)3. The anticipated requirement is for approximately 750 radios. A summary table of the radio's required capabilities is provided at the end of this RFI.<br /><br />Background of Signal Modernization Program initiatives: Operational requirements have pushed the need for nodes lower in the formation. These nodes will operate in commercial and military satellite bands and will support up to four enclaves with voice, data, and video teleconferencing. SIGMOD program requirements will be executed via the Transmission Capability Production Document (CPD) that was approved on 30 January 2015.</p>
<p>To demonstrate SIGMOD initiatives, the Expeditionary Signal Battalion (ESB) SIGMOD will demonstrate materiel and organizational changes in the ESB structure in order to provide increased network capacity / capabilities to support Command Posts (Company through Brigade) and to Install, Operate and Maintain (IOM) these capabilities without increasing organizational manning. The Project Manager (PM) WIN-T plans to reconfigure all ESB's and to conduct a series of operational and system evaluations in Fiscal Years (FY) 2016-2017.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">In December 2010, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) introduced the first mass production battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. &nbsp;As a result, federal agencies began factoring these vehicles into their decision making processes as they acquired new vehicles. &nbsp;The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) awarded the first contracts for electric vehicles (EVs) in May 2011 and continues to do so today. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">In 2007 Executive Order (EO) 13423 charged Agencies with acquiring plug-in electric hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) when commercially available at a cost reasonably comparable, on the basis of life-cycle cost, to non-PHEVs. &nbsp;In 2009 Executive Order 13514 called on agencies to go further to reduce their carbon footprint by reducing<span style="BACKGROUND: white"> petroleum consumption by 2% per year through FY2020. The Department of Energy's Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) guidance recommended achieving this by</span> increasing the number of electric, hybrid electric, and plug-in hybrid electric. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">In 2015 Executive Order 13693 revoked EO 13423 and 13514 and mandated Federal Fleets beginning in FY16 to reduce per-mile Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions 30 percent by 2025 from a 2014 baseline, as well as meet specific reduction targets for intermediary years. The order goes further by mandating Federal agencies to increase the percentage of zero emission and plug-in hybrid vehicle acquisitions in their fleets to comprise 20% of all new vehicle acquisitions by 2020 and 50% of all new acquisitions by 2025. &nbsp;It also says Agencies shall plan for appropriate charging or refueling infrastructure for zero emission vehicles or plug-in hybrid vehicles and look towards opportunities for ancillary services to support vehicle-to-grid technology. The Implementing Instructions published along with EO 13693 by the White House requires "that Agencies shall similarly procure charging stations and, where possible, infrastructure that will allow for vehicle level data reporting capabilities." </span></p>

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) is considering the benefits of enabling the use of partnership arrangements in association with the Mission Systems Operations Contract (MSOC).  This synopsis is a Request for Information (RFI) to solicit comments from industry regarding such potential partnerships.  Specifically, we are inquiring if industry perceives any innovative external or internal partnership opportunities that could be developed within the Flight Operations Directorates (FODs) Mission Systems (MS) (Mission Control Center Systems (MCCS), Training Systems (TS), Space Vehicle Mock-up Facility (SVMF)). <p> Include in your submission responses to the following questions: <p> 1.	Ideas: What type of innovative partnership opportunities does your company envision within the FOD MS? <p> 2.	Type of Partnership: Would this partnership be a collaborative effort, a utilization of NASAs unique capabilities, utilization of excess capacity, or something else? <p> 3.	Partnership Arrangement: What type of arrangement would you propose to best facilitate the partnership?

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a Sources Sought publication only. The purpose of this Sources Sought notice is solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Please do not submit a proposal in response to this notice. This notice is to assist the VA in the determination of sources only. A solicitation is not currently available. Responses to this Sources Sought Notice are not a request to be added to a prospective bidders list or to receive a copy of the solicitation.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Sioux Falls VA Health Care System, is seeking potential Contractors capable of providing Health Care for Homeless Veterans Contract Emergency Residential Services (HCHV-CERS). HCHV-CERS provides an opportunity to rapidly reduce homelessness among Veterans, particularly those who present with co-occurring mental health and substance use treatment needs and have been difficult to engage in treatment. These services are solely dedicated to Veteran patients of the Sioux Falls VA Health Care System.

The contractor shall furnish services to the beneficiaries for whom such care is specifically authorized by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). It is understood that the type of veterans to be cared for under this contract will require care and treatment services over and above the level of room and board and will include both men and women Veterans. The Contractor shall make available a minimum of nine rooms per day.

The Sioux Falls Veterans Affairs Health Care System catchment area encompasses eastern South Dakota, northwest Iowa, and southwest Minnesota. The largest population served is in Sioux Falls, SD, which is the location of the main facility. The HCHV-CERS will be located in Sioux Falls in order to serve the largest population.

The Sioux Falls VA is looking for responses from contractors regarding their capability to provide the above mentioned services.

Services to be provided include:

ROOM AND BOARD:  Room and Board to include a bed and other furnishings such as a dresser, storage, and personal linens (towels and bed sheets).  The bed must be designated for use exclusively by the individual Veteran from the time of admission to the time of discharge.  The bed must be situated in a room that affords the Veteran safety, privacy and security.  Each Veteran must have a safe and secure place to store their belongings that is readily accessible to the Veteran (such as a locking closet, a locking armoire, a locker, etc.)  Meals to include at least three (3) nutritionally adequate meals a day, 7 days a week and availability of nutritious snacks between meals and bedtime for those requiring or desiring additional food, when it is not medically contraindicated.  VA dietitian may assess printed menus as well as Veterans' satisfaction with meals and the actual consumption of food offered in determining the Contractor's success in meeting this requirement during annual facility inspection or at any point during the contract period. 

CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES:  The Contractor shall provide, at minimum, the following case management services to Veterans in the program:
1.	Engagement of the Veteran in the service planning process.  Contractor will carry responsibility for interviewing, counseling and case managing identified Veterans by conducting psychosocial assessments to identify treatment needs which affect the Veterans' adjustment to their environment, and establish treatment goals.  Contractor will utilize counseling strategies to include crisis intervention and case management including both short and long-term services. 
2.	Contractor will assess the psychosocial and environmental needs or dysfunction secondary to or exacerbating the social, substance or psychiatric problems, which might contribute to Veterans' readjustment challenges in the community.  Contractor establishes and maintains an intensive therapeutic relationship with the Veteran, staff, and community programs/agencies, and is responsible for formulating case-management treatment goals and plans that address identified needs, stressors and problems. 
3.	Contractor will conduct high-risk screening, psychosocial assessment and treatment planning, actively involving the Veteran and their family or significant others, in coordination with the team members.  Psychosocial assessments will include goals for clinical treatment. Contractor coordinates and documents clinical case management and psychosocial services and documents the overall effectiveness of the case management services provided.  Specifically, Contractor will:
a.	Develop a highly Individualized Service Plan (ISP) with the Veteran consistent with low demand program goals; the plan must specifically include provisions for Veteran placement into an appropriate transitional or permanent housing placement within 60 days of admission to the HCHV Contract Residential Emergency Housing with no more than 60 days without a planned reason for extension. The housing placement planning must take into account all appropriate and available community based housing options as well as the Veteran's preferences regarding location and housing type.  The plan should also be focused on getting the Veteran(s) to accept services, especially mental health and substance use services that will allow attainment of transitional or permanent housing.  Acceptance of the services offered should not be a condition of continued stay in Health Care for Homeless Veterans Contract Emergency Residential Services programming.  However, engagement and service delivery should retain the expectation that the Veteran will advance to permanent housing with support, recognizing that it will often be at his or her own pace.
b.	Complete a written ISP within the first two (2) weeks of program admission and signed by the Contractor, the Veteran, and the Contract Residential Coordinator.
c.	Review ISP a minimum every thirty (30) days thereafter in a clinical meeting with the Veteran. Updated plans must be promptly communicated to the Contract Residential Coordinator.
d.	Make changes in plans in consultation with the Veteran.
e.	Coordinate with Contract Residential Coordinator during weekly case conferences regarding updates and changes in Veterans' care plans to foster a collaborative relationship with the SFVAHCS and Contractor in meeting Veterans' needs.  Case conferencing may be done in person or by telephonic conference calls as determined by SFVAHCS staff.
f.	Obtain relevant Releases of Information to communicate and coordinate Veterans' treatment with VA and other community based service providers.
g.	Work in close collaboration with the Contract Residential Coordinator to ensure Veterans' connections to needed VA medical, mental health, and substance abuse treatment and care.
h.	Contractor will take primary responsibility for assisting Veterans in completing housing applications and other benefits paperwork as needed.  Contractor will assist Veterans in obtaining the needed documentation required for complete applications including but not limited to, birth certificates, driver's license/State issued ID, income verification and any additional information required by housing resources and potential income supports..

Additional Information: The VA seeks to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification (HUBZone, 8(a), small, small disadvantaged or service disabled veteran owned small business) relative to NAICS Code 624221, Temporary Shelters; size standard of $11 Million.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to procure for the first P-8A flight test aircraft developed and built (hereafter referred to as "Test Aircraft T-1" or "the aircraft"): (1) aircraft depot maintenance; (2) depot In-Service-Repair (ISR); and (3) validation of the Draft P-8A Integrated Maintenance Plan Depot Specification (IMPDS). <br />DISCLAIMER:<br />This Sources Sought Notice is issued in accordance with DFARS 206.302-1(d) and PGI 206.302-1. This is not a Request for Proposals. Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this Notice. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Notice or otherwise pay any person's costs incurred responding to this Notice.<br />Background: <br />On 14 June 2004, The Boeing Company (Boeing) was awarded the P-8A System Development and Demonstration Contract N00019-04-C-3146 under a best value limited competition. The P-8A weapons system consists of a basic 737-800 ERX air vehicle modified to meet Navy requirements, to include systems and subsystems for avionics, communications, mission, and weapon capabilities. Boeing is the original designer, developer, and manufacturer of the P-8A and its sole integrator. Test Aircraft T-1 was the first P-8A developed and built. Its configuration is unique (one-of-a-kind). It is scheduled to be delivered (via DD Form 250) to the Government on or about October 2016. The aircraft is outfitted with test instrumentation from nose to tail. It is a loads calibrated airframe. Test instrumentation throughout the aircraft includes: 2,000+ loads bridges; 1,100+ accelerometers, pressure sensors, etc.; and 500+ intellibus interface modules. Aside from the configuration and non-commercial and commercial technical data associated with the aircraft excluding the instrumentation, the Government does not possess any technical data associated with the test instrumentation. The contemplated effort, in part, will require the resulting contractor to displace (move or remove) test instrumentation; after performing depot activities, replace (or re-install) test instrumentation; perform operational and functional checks of the instrumentation; and take action, as necessary, to get the instrumentation as a whole to perform correctly.<br />Required Tasking: <br />This effort consists of Integrated Maintenance Plan Depot Specification (IMPDS) maintenance and repair in accordance with A1-P8AAA-PMIC-000P-8A Periodic Maintenance Information Card (PMIC) Scheduled Maintenance Plan (SMP), A1-P8AAA-AMM-100/200 Aircraft Maintenance Manual, and NAVAIR P-8A IMPDS. This effort will also include supporting Government Functional Check Flights (FCFs) as appropriate. As previously stated, the effort requires displacing, replacing, operational/functional checking, and correcting test aircraft instrumentation in order to perform the maintenance and repair work. All work must be performed at NAS Patuxent River, MD.<br />SUBMISSION DETAILS:<br />Interested persons may submit a Capability Statement identifying their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. Only Capability Statements received on or before 13 November 2015 will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in November.
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.secure.force.com/AAAP. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>The Open Period for November is November 1, 2015 to November 7, 2014, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.secure.force.com/AAAP).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>
<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2014 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>If you have previously submitted an offer, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the new RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually.   <br /> <br />OCCUPANCY: Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.<br /> <br />DELINEATED AREA:  Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and certain counties in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.<br /> <br />LEASE TERM:  Up to 10 years.</p>

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>** If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2015, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2016 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Please be sure to review each page prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the 'Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Your previous offered space will not be copied<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">.</strong></p>

<p>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this contemplated effort. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI may be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for future needs. The information provided may be utilized by the US Forest Service in developing its acquisition strategy and in its Statement of Objective, Statement of Work, and/or Performance Specifications. The information resulting from this RFI may be included or combined with other submissions in one or more options considered in the analysis of alternatives. Any proprietary information that is submitted may be used in establishing requirements of the future services but specific information will be safeguarded as proprietary.</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The FS, along with its partners, conduct annual aerial surveillance of our Nation's Forests over approximately 500 million acres. This effort, typically employed utilizing manned aircraft, serves to characterize the health and vitality of our natural resources and is used for planning forest health treatments nationally.</p>
<p>Further, the FS is currently developing UAS integration policy and operational procedures. This RFI is being used to inform future FS contract development and policy, to ensure that the FS has the best available compliment of appropriate tools and technology, maximizing the safety of its employees, partners and the public to fulfill our Agency mission.  The full range of responses to this RFI will be considered as the FS moves forward to safely and effectively integrate UAS technology where appropriate.</p>
<p>2. PURPOSE</p>
<p>The US Forest Service (FS), Washington Office (WO detached) Forest Management (FM) and Forest Health Protection (FHP) is conducting a market analysis with this RFI to determine the most suitable approach for developing an aviation services contract to utilize UAS for acquisition of forest health conditions and biomass data within an approximate 200 acre pilot project in the Southwestern Region.</p>
<p>1.	Demonstrate that the FS can successfully and economically contract for UAS services with a current provider having a Section 333 exemption from the FAA (https://www.faa.gov/uas/legislative_programs/section_333/ ).<br />2.	Determine whether UAS acquired aerial imagery and data products can be used to cost-effectively estimate woody biomass.<br />3.	Determine whether UAS acquired aerial imagery and data products can be used to cost-effectively detect and monitor a Spruce Aphid (Elatobium abietinum) and/or Spruce Engraver Beetle (Ips hunteri) outbreaks in Arizona.</p>
<p>Responding to this RFI does not automatically include the responder on any bidders list, if such a list is developed.  Depending on the quantity and quality of the responses received, the criteria may serve to generate the initial pool of potential contractors to be invited to respond to a resulting solicitation.</p>
<p>3. REQUESTED INFORMATION</p>
<p>WO FHP &amp; FM is interested in collecting information on industry capabilities, a range of rough cost and production rates estimates pertaining to the contracting of public use UAS operation including specifications for operation, sensor(s) and data output products based on the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Area of interest is located in FS Region 3, the Southwest Region, within the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI) area in vicinity of Hannigan Meadow area on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona (Figures 1 &amp; 2).  All operations shall be over U.S. Forest Service Lands, outside of federally designated Wilderness and in class G airspace.  The precise location will be provided prior to operations, based on forest pest activity and ongoing vegetation management activities.  The FS will provide Contracting Officers Representative and Flight Manager to coordinate timing and provide contractual oversight on the project.  Scope of contract would be confined to aerial acquisition and delivery of remotely sensed data to facilitate subsequent FS analyses of those data (see Technical Details).</p>
<p>&bull; UAS operator will be responsible for all necessary certifications and approvals (FAA 333 commercial operator, FAA Certificate of Authorization, aircraft registration, pilot with FAA airman certificate, National Telecommunications &amp; Information Administration approval), timing of flight, data acquisition and delivery in accordance with FS specialist input and the contract.  The UAS operation is planned to optimize gathering of forest biometrics and health conditions data within the biological window from June -July, 2016.</p>
<p>&bull; UAS pilot is expected to comply with FAA policy, conditions of the COA and FS policy for operation.  Respondees should consider line of site and alternatives to line of site that, based on their experience and current policy, would be approved in a COA for this project.  Approximately 1/3 of the project area will not likely provide line of site visibility from ground-based pilot locations.  Additional field reconnaissance will be done by the FS prior to advertisement and operation.  Sample COAs approved by the FAA for similar projects conducted by the company shall be provided in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>&bull; Responses should include past company experience with UAS, a description of pilot and airworthiness standards, FAA operator specifications for the company, safety record/accident history, spectrum management and communication capabilities relevant to project area, and the company's Safety Management Systems and/or Safety Plan.</p>
<p>&bull; Technical Details within responses should address the feasibility of and/or reasonable alternatives to meeting the following:<br /> <br />&bull;	Small UAS 55 lbs or less, fixed-wing or rotor (describe advantages/disadvantages)<br />&bull;	A listing with number of and position titles of all company personnel that would be necessary in the operations and oversite of the project.<br />&bull;	Sensor type(s) that would be deployed to acquire current imagery at or near peak signature for the primary pest, four-band (visible and near-infrared)<br />&bull;	2cm ground resolution, <br />&bull;	Digital format with 8-bit or greater dynamic range and georeferenced to within 1 foot RMSE<br />&bull;	Collected for stereo continuous coverage with 60% overlap (wall-to-wall)<br />&bull;	Operational altitudes above ground, airspeed and environmental limitations<br />&bull;	Product delivery will be at or near real time <br />&bull;	Flight time endurance per battery charge or fuel tank load<br />Imagery will be processed to create large scale digital orthophotography, stereo pairs, block files and other appropriate products from Imagine Photogrammetry.  In order to reference plots accurately between photos products and field sampling, the images need to be georeferenced to less than one meter, if possible.  Processing and analysis of these data shall be accomplished by the FS.  Additionally, if this sample project proves out, FHP may employ this technology elsewhere and reduce or augment conventional manned aerial detection survey and management response.<br />&bull; Company Information Requested:</p>
<p>Vendors/contractors who respond to this Request for Information (RFI) are requested to provide all of the following information in writing and in accordance with the directions below:</p>
<p>COMPANY INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1.	Company name<br />2.	Company mailing address<br />3.	Company point of contact (name &amp; title)<br />4.	Point of contact's telephone numbers (office &amp; fax)<br />5.	Company's size standard for the NAICS code listed<br />6.	Any qualified business categories (Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Woman owned, 8(a), etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your responses and capability statements are requested by 16 November 2015 4PM MST</p>
<p>Note:<br />You may provide any other pertinent information that may contribute to efficiencies related to this RFI that will assist the Government in developing specifications for future solicitations.</p>
<p><br />Thank you for your interest.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in support of Laboratory of Vaccine Research intends to negotiate on an other than full and open competition with Bachem Americas Inc., 3132 Kashiwa Street, Torrance, Ca. 90205, USA. These peptides must be custom synthesized and require the addition of non-natural amino acids that will allow for the peptide to be incorporated into an immunogenic vaccine formulation developed by the vaccine research center. These custom peptides have been incorporated into ongoing experiments. The continuity of reagents must stay the same to insure that experimental results are not influenced by new variables and to avoid any long delays in testing products from other suppliers. Changing variables would prevent the correct interpretation of the experiments in progress. This is not a request for proposal.  The statutory authority for this sole source requirement is 41 U.S.C. 25(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 only one source available, no substitutions possible. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  All responsible sources may submit their capabilities and past performance providing the required equipment and certifications.  All responsible sources may submit a response that will be considered.  The Government reserves the right to make a decision whether this requirement is available for competition.  All responses shall be submitted no later than 5:00p.m.  Eastern Standard Time Monday, November 9, 2015 to Lawrence Bland at blandl@niaid.nih.gov <br />

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to notify industry that the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B). This notice of intent applies to three separate actions.
<p>The Government has three requirements described below that have been supported under our Global Battlestaff and Program Support (GBPS) contracts since 2010. These three requirements will be the first/original requirements to transition to our SOF-Wide Mission Support (SWMS) Group A contracts. Due to an extended acquisition timeline and multiple protests, SWMS Group A is not yet available. The contracted services described below are mission critical and this support cannot lapse. As such, the Government intends to issue three purchase orders to bridge this critical support for a period of 6 months allowing the SWMS Group A contracts to clear protests. The purchase orders will be issued under NAICS 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services with a size standard of $15M.</p>
<p>The Three requirements are:</p>
<p>(1) Regional Magazine Initiative support of publications and collateral print media. The purchase order will be issued to Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc., 8283 Greensboro Drive, McLean, VA 22102. The estimated cost of this purchase order is $800K.</p>
<p>(2) Technical and programmatice support to Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Special Reconnaissance and Surveillance and Exploitation (SRSE). The purchase order will be issued to Jacobs Technology, Inc., 5401 W. Kennedy Blvd., Suite 900, Tampa, FL 33609. The estimated cost of this purchase order is $650K.</p>
<p>(3) Technical and programmatic support to PEO Maritime. The purchase order will be issued to SRA International, Inc., 4300 Fair Lakes Ct., Fairfax, VA 22033. The estimated cost of this purchase order is $2M.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, all responses received within seven days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A change in the strategy detailed above based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

All proposal submitted by an offeror other than a hotel shall provide the following: (1) Hotel agreement verified, and countersigned by both parties and the authorized agent of the participating hotel (hotel letterhead). 
(Again, this is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.

The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offerors specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>Stickpin BAER Aerial Mulching. The Colville National Forest has a requirement to implement an emergency aerial mulch treatment with wood shred and Certified Weed Free Ag-Straw to restore soil cover in critical High and Moderate Soil Burn Severity areas of the Stickpin Fire. These treatments should reduce the potential increase of sediment delivery on the Colville National Forest, Three Rivers and Republic Ranger Districts and other downstream values at risk (e.g. municipal watershed). Treatments will be applied to 20-60% slopes by rotary-wing aircraft. Downstream peak flows are anticipated to increase due to reduced soil cover and hydrophobic soil conditions. Mulching treatments will reduce downstream peak flows by absorbing and slowly releasing overland runoff. Mulching will also help to protect the native seedbed and retain moisture on the burned slopes to facilitate native vegetation recovery in the treatment areas.
<p><br />The project is located within the Stickpin Fire on the Republic and Three Rivers Ranger Districts on the Colville National Forest and within Ferry County in Northeast Washington.</p>
<p>The elevation range is 4200' to 5730' above mean sea level for the treatment area. A general vicinity map is attached and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) shapefiles of project areas will be provided. These GIS shapefiles shall be provided electronically to the Contractor. All of the treatment units are located within the Stickpin Fire perimeter, north of Boulder-Deer Creek Road (Ferry County Road -602). See Attachment D for more detailed location information.</p>
<p>Airfields in the vicinity of the Stickpin Fire:</p>
<p>Airport Name Direction and Distance from Fire Area Latitude Longitude<br />Avey Field State North @ 11 miles 48.999821 -118.218693<br />Ferry County West @ 17 miles 48.713936 -118.658536<br />Colville Municipal Southeast @ 33 miles 48.544019 -117.884482</p>
<p>The work under this contract consists of aerial application of two types of mulch material to 13 designated units representing 989 acres total. Of the total acres, wood shred shall be applied to five units (241 ac) and Certified Weed Free Ag-straw shall be applied to eight units (748 ac). The mulch (wood shred and ag-straw) must be delivered to designated staging areas or processing areas, processed and prepared, and then staged for aerial delivery by rotary-wing aircraft. Potential processing, staging, and helispots are located on an attached map (Attachments D &amp; F). Processing of the weed free ag-straw will be required using a belly grinder, tub grinder, or equivalent piece of equipment that will produce 4-8 inch mulch lengths. The Forest Service will approve the piece of equipment if it is not one of the two processers mentioned. The processing of the wood shred will be required using a variable speed biomass grinder with adjustable screen widths (recommended 4-inch screen).</p>
<p>Both Item 01 and Item 02 require the use of two helicopters. The Contractor may add an Optional Item 03 that includes the use of a third helicopter. Contractors are also encouraged to include alternate proposals and pricings for Optional Items 01a and 01b.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall furnishing of all tools, equipment, materials, supplies (except those designated as Government-Furnished), labor, supervision, workman's compensation, unemployment insurance, transportation, and incidentals to perform all work necessary to accomplish the aerial applications.</p>
<p>Based on the urgency of the project, the period of performance is 12 days to allow for much processing time and weather delays. Flying time for all items is estimated as 6 days.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the work will start right after award.</p>
<p>This project will be advertised as a written request for proposals and will be solicited under the Simplified Acquisition Procurement (SAP) rules and Commercial Item Procedures (Test Program).</p>
<p>Due to the urgent and compelling timeline of this requirement, the response time is short. The issue date of the solicitation is on or about October 30, 2015. The due date of proposals is November 3, 2015.</p>
<p>The proposed project listed here is a 100 percent small business set-aside. NAICS code is 115310, size standard $7.5 million.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal/offer which will be considered. An electronic copy of the solicitation will be posted at this site on the issue date.</p>

<DESC>NSA Mid-South RFP LO-2015303

The Department of the Navy (DON) is making available for lease non-excess real property at Naval Support Activity (NSA) Mid-South in Millington, Tennessee, under the authority of Title 10, United States Code  2667.  

The proposed site consists of four non-contiguous parcels totaling approximately 72 acres.  

The vision for this opportunity is for DON to lease the property to a qualified non-Federal user (Lessee) for solar PV generation, storage, and distribution.  The DON does not intend to purchase power generated on the lease premises. The Lessee will have to distribute power from the site to the commercial grid. Ownership of the site shall remain with the Government for the duration of the lease term.

The Lessee will timely develop, operate, and maintain a renewable generation asset within the site for the term of the lease and will provide in-kind consideration, which enhances the installations energy security posture, and/or lease rent cash payments to the DON not less than the fair market rental value of the developers leasehold interest, as determined by Government appraisal.
  The term of the proposed lease will be calculated by adding a period of construction to the term length of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) negotiated for power offake.  The fair market rental value of the sites is estimated between $700,000 and $710,000 (Net Present Value) for the anticipated lease term.

The competition for the potential outlease on DON land will be handled through a Tennessee Valley Authoritys (TVA) Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).  DON anticipates outleasing the land to TVAs selected developer. TVAs request for proposals for a 20-year PPA is posted at: https://www.tva.com/file_source/TVA/Site%20Content/Information/power_purchase_agreements/Millington%20RFP%20and%20PPA%20Combined.pdf

Site maps will be added via amendment.

<p>MARKET VALUE:  	 	GS-15 equivalent ($101,630 - $ 132,122 per annum)</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	This is an intermittent contract with a level of effort of eight (8) months. The specific number of days to be worked will be determined by mutual agreement between the contract employee and the Mission.</p>
<p>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: 	Pristina, Kosovo</p>
<p>AREA OF CONSIDERATION:	US Citizens</p>
<p><br />I.	POSITION DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The USAID Mission for Kosovo (USAID/Kosovo), located in Pristina, manages one of the most important and complex assistance programs in the region.  In line with USG and Kosovo priorities, USAID/Kosovo's five-year Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) envisages Kosovo as an effective state, with a viable economy and an inclusive democracy on the path to European integration.</p>
<p>The realization of this vision requires close cooperation between USAID/Kosovo, other USG entities, the international community, USAID implementing partners, and, above all, partnership with Kosovo institutions and local stakeholders.</p>
<p>Since the end of conflict in Kosovo, USAID has been the key donor in establishing economic policies and a legal and institutional framework in Kosovo. The key institutions, laws, and regulations are generally in place, as is a sound fiscal and financial system. Among the institutions supported by USAID technical assistance were the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of Economic Development (MED), the Central Bank of Kosovo (CBK), Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP), the Tax Administration of Kosovo (TAK), the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA), the Kosovo Pension Savings Trust (KPST), Kosovo Electric Company (Korporata Elektroenergjetike e Kosov&euml;s - KEK), Energy Regulatory Office (ERO), Kosovo Veterinary and Food Agency (KVFA), Kosovo Forest Agency (KFA) and others. Much progress has been made in building their capacity. Several, such as the CBK, the KPST, and the privatization agency, now function at a level of proficiency that does not require ongoing donor support.</p>
<p>USAID assistance until recently was focused on support for the basic building blocks of an independent Kosovo. For Kosovo to move forward, it needs to establish a clear economic base for development and to consolidate democratic achievements. Consequently, with the new CDCS, USAID assistance is focusing on supporting the private sector, which is best-positioned to determine Kosovo's comparative advantages and best able to increase incomes and jobs. With basic government functions operating with a degree of effectiveness, it is important to ensure that there is a vibrant civil society that is capable of holding the government accountable and demanding rule of law.</p>
<p>In addition, USAID has increased its focus on supporting municipalities. Kosovo's central government institutions have achieved remarkable progress in a short period of time. While threats to these gains still remain, support for building the capabilities of local government remain one of the key objectives of USAID assistance in Kosovo.</p>
<p>At the center, focus is shifting from establishing institutions to making them functional. Central government institutions still require support to varying degrees of involvement. Over the next five years, the task will be to consolidate and build on successes at the center, and begin to scale back support to those ministries and agencies that are capable of successfully fulfilling their mandate without full-time donor assistance.</p>
<p>Support for youth and education is a major new area. Youth-oriented programs play a central role in USAID's portfolio. Youth and education interventions are cross-cutting and based on a strong partnership with the GOK and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>A key element of USAID's approach is strong synergies throughout the portfolio to maximize impact - such as the coordination between programs to improve the business environment; to institute better contract enforcement and alternative dispute resolution methods in the rule of law sector; and to offer integrated economic growth and governance support programs in municipalities.</p>
<p>II. SPECIFIC DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The overall objective of the Senior Development Advisor is to provide USAID Mission with necessary advice and policy and strategic support for making informed decisions regarding the performance of Economic Growth Office (EGO) programs in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and impact, and also to make recommendations on any possible change in the project development and implementation strategies. The Senior Development Advisor will assume Development Objective 2 and 3 (DO2 &amp; DO3) advisory responsibilities and will support EGO in the design and procurement process of the new activities that will be awarded in 2015. In addition, the Senior Development Advisor is expected to play an active role in supporting the DO2 and DO3 teams in the implementation of the activities that are part of the DO2 and DO3 portfolios.  The DO2 and DO3 portfolios include activities supporting increased investment and private sector employment and education.

The term "organizational conflict of interest" means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or the person has an unfair competitive advantage.

The offeror may also provide relevant facts that show how its organizational and/or management system or other actions would avoid or mitigate any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest.
  (c) Based on this information and any other information solicited or obtained by the contracting officer, the contracting officer may determine that an organizational conflict of interest exists which would warrant disqualifying the contractor for award of the contract unless the organizational conflict of interest can be mitigated to the contracting officer's satisfaction by negotiating terms and conditions of the contract to that effect. If the conflict of interest cannot be mitigated and if the contracting officer finds that it is in the best interest of the United States to award the contract, the contracting officer shall request a waiver in accordance with FAR 9.503 and 48 CFR 809.503.
  (d) Nondisclosure or misrepresentation of actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest at the time of the offer, or arising as a result of a modification to the contract, may result in the termination of the contract at no expense to the Government. (End of Provision)

  (b) Eligible service-disabled veteran-owned offerors will receive full credit, and offerors qualifying as veteran-owned small businesses will receive partial credit for the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran-owned Small Business Status evaluation factor. To receive credit, an offeror must be registered and verified in Vendor Information Pages (VIP) database. (http://www.VetBiz.gov).
  (c) Non-veteran offerors proposing to use service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or veteran-owned small businesses as subcontractors will receive some consideration under this evaluation factor. Offerors must state in their proposals the names of the SDVOSBs and VOSBs with whom they intend to subcontract and provide a brief description of the proposed subcontracts and the approximate dollar values of the proposed subcontracts. In addition, the proposed subcontractors must be registered and verified in the VetBiz.gov VIP database (http://www.vetbiz.gov). (End of Provision)

    (2) Identify the solicitation and/or contract number;
    (3) Include an original signed by the protester or the protester's representative and at least one copy;
    (4) Set forth a detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds of the protest, including a description of resulting prejudice to the protester, and provide copies of relevant documents;
    (5) Specifically request a ruling of the individual upon whom the protest is served;
    (6) State the form of relief requested; and
    (7) Provide all information establishing the timeliness of the protest.
  (b) Failure to comply with the above may result in dismissal of the protest without further consideration.
  (c) Bidders/offerors and contracting officers are encouraged to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedures to resolve protests at any stage in the protest process.

   Order of importance: Factor 1: Technical Capabilities, Factor 2: Present/Past Performance, & Factor 3: Price 
  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p>Secure Documents</p>
<p>As this requirement will be an unrestricted, competitive action, several of the solicitation documents will be posted as "secured" on the Federal Business Opportunity ("FedBizOpps" or "FBO") website.&nbsp; In order to view those documents, vendors will need to obtain special access.&nbsp; The process of obtaining access is somewhat lengthy, therefore all interested vendors are encouraged to begin that process as soon as possible.&nbsp; Instructions for obtaining access are provided below.</p>
<p>Instructions for access to the FBO Secure Site</p>
<p>To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in the FBO system, vendors must follow these instructions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Register in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.&nbsp; For assistance with SAM, please contact the SAM help desk.&nbsp; Contact information is available at https://www.fsd.gov/.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Once registered in SAM, go to the FBO website at https://www.fbo.gov/ and log in.&nbsp; Verify your SAM registration within the FBO system.&nbsp; For assistance with FBO, please consult the FBO Vendor Guide, which is available at https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;After your SAM registration is verified in the FBO system, please follow the steps as outlined below:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;Begin by clicking on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement.&nbsp; The DD2345 is also available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf. <br />b)&nbsp;Fill out the DD 2345 and submit a hard copy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on the form.<br />c)&nbsp;JCP will return an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification and expiration date.&nbsp; Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect.<br />d)&nbsp;For assistance with the DD2345, or to inquire about the acceptability of electronic provision of documentation, please contact the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS.&nbsp; Contact information is available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/team.aspx.&nbsp; DLA Energy is not involved in the approval process and cannot provide assistance with processing.<br />e)&nbsp;Once approval is received, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Once you receive the approved DD2345 from JCP, and have verified your status on the JCP website, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link.&nbsp; The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN.&nbsp; If you are not prompted to enter a MPIN, please contact the FBO help desk.&nbsp; Contact information can be found at https://www.fsd.gov/.</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;The MPIN is a mandatory data element created by the SAM registrant which must have nine characters [consisting of at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number, with no spaces or special characters permitted]<br />b)&nbsp;The MPIN allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also validates access to sensitive, but unclassified, documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors must then submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button.&nbsp; Upon requesting explicit access in the FBO system, vendors should send an email notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, so that they can approve the request in the FBO system.&nbsp; Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.</p>
<p>Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.</p>

<p>A copy of the solicitation will be available on or after August 19, 2015, via the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) system (https://www.fbo.gov).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secure Documents</p>
<p>As this requirement will be an unrestricted, competitive action, several of the solicitation documents will be posted as "secured" on the Federal Business Opportunity ("FedBizOpps" or "FBO") website.&nbsp; In order to view those documents, vendors will need to obtain special access.&nbsp; The process of obtaining access is somewhat lengthy, therefore all interested vendors are encouraged to begin that process as soon as possible.&nbsp; Instructions for obtaining access are provided below.</p>
<p>Instructions for access to the FBO Secure Site</p>
<p>To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in the FBO system, vendors must follow these instructions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Register in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.&nbsp; For assistance with SAM, please contact the SAM help desk.&nbsp; Contact information is available at https://www.fsd.gov/.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Once registered in SAM, go to the FBO website at https://www.fbo.gov/ and log in.&nbsp; Verify your SAM registration within the FBO system.&nbsp; For assistance with FBO, please consult the FBO Vendor Guide, which is available at https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;After your SAM registration is verified in the FBO system, please follow the steps as outlined below:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;Begin by clicking on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement.&nbsp; The DD2345 is also available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf. <br />b)&nbsp;Fill out the DD 2345 and submit a hard copy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on the form.<br />c)&nbsp;JCP will return an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification and expiration date.&nbsp; Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect.<br />d)&nbsp;For assistance with the DD2345, or to inquire about the acceptability of electronic provision of documentation, please contact the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS.&nbsp; Contact information is available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/team.aspx.&nbsp; DLA Energy is not involved in the approval process and cannot provide assistance with processing.<br />e)&nbsp;Once approval is received, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Once you receive the approved DD2345 from JCP, and have verified your status on the JCP website, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link.&nbsp; The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN.&nbsp; If you are not prompted to enter a MPIN, please contact the FBO help desk.&nbsp; Contact information can be found at https://www.fsd.gov/.</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;The MPIN is a mandatory data element created by the SAM registrant which must have nine characters [consisting of at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number, with no spaces or special characters permitted]<br />b)&nbsp;The MPIN allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also validates access to sensitive, but unclassified, documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors must then submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button.&nbsp; Upon requesting explicit access in the FBO system, vendors should send an email notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, so that they can approve the request in the FBO system.&nbsp; Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.</p>
<p>Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.<br /><br />***********************************<br /><br />The Pre-proposal Conference will be held at&nbsp;U.S. Army Garrison West Point&nbsp;on October 19, 2015.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840
Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840
The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp
If internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the HQ AMC-Level Protest Procedures. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>Term is mandatory for lodging and hotel requirements. 
This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. 
For a proposal submitted by an offeror other than a hotel, the offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor. 
All proposal submitted by an offeror other than a hotel shall provide the following: (1) Valid business insurance certificate. (2) Hotel agreement verified, and countersigned by both parties and the authorized agent of the participating hotel (hotel letterhead). 
(Again, this is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable). <BR> <BR>

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<SUBJECT>Ohio Tree Removal for Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB) Eradication Efforts 
<SOLNBR>AG-6395-SS-16-0001
<NTYPE>SRCSGT
<RESPDATE>110615
<CONTACT>Lisa A Draves, Phone 612-336-3364, Email lisa.a.draves@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC><p>U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is seeking capability statements from all firms interested in performing work to remove Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB) host trees, shrubs, limbs, branches, exposed surface roots and stumps (not all inclusive) infested and at high risk of infestation by ALB in Clermont County Ohio. There is the possibility of expansion into surrounding areas if new infestations are identified. As USDA/Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) continues to survey trees in and around the Quarantine Zone, additional infested trees may be detected.</p>
<p>Service will be on a year-round, as-needed basis in support of the USDA/ODA program strategies for the eradication of ALB in Ohio. The USDA and/or the ODA will secure approval from the property owners to access the site where the infested trees are located on their property in order to remove the tree(s) and/or host material. Tree removal activities will be completed on public and/or private property in both landscaped/maintained settings and in non-maintained areas.</p>
<p>The Contractor may be required to service two or more sites simultaneously to meet the eradication goals of the USDA. Removal requirements vary from approximately 1-15 trees per week to 600 trees per week. The contractor must maintain at least one crew and have the capacity to expand to 10 crews. Contractor personnel must include a full-time arborist with current certification from the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) or equivalent organization.</p>
<p>The equipment necessary to perform the work may include, but is not limited to, the following: chip box trucks, chippers/grinders (up to 15" DPH capacity), stump grinders, bucket trucks, felling equipment (chainsaws, feller buncher), swamp mats, mowers (exerts a ground pressure &lt; 8 psi and mulches mows woody stems up to 6" SBH), transport equipment (grapple skidder, forwarded, clam bunk), and cable skidder.</p>

There is the possibility of expansion into surrounding areas if new infestations are identified. As USDA/Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) continues to survey trees in and around the Quarantine Zone, additional infested trees may be detected.</p>
<p>Service will be on a year-round, as-needed basis in support of the USDA/ODA program strategies for the eradication of ALB in Ohio. The USDA and/or the ODA will secure approval from the property owners to access the site where the infested trees are located on their property in order to remove the tree(s) and/or host material. Tree removal activities will be completed on public and/or private property in both landscaped/maintained settings and in non-maintained areas.</p>
<p>The Contractor may be required to service two or more sites simultaneously to meet the eradication goals of the USDA. Removal requirements vary from approximately 1-15 trees per week to 600 trees per week. The contractor must maintain at least one crew and have the capacity to expand to 10 crews. Contractor personnel must include a full-time arborist with current certification from the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) or equivalent organization.</p>
<p>The equipment necessary to perform the work may include, but is not limited to, the following: chip box trucks, chippers/grinders (up to 15" DPH capacity), stump grinders, bucket trucks, felling equipment (chainsaws, feller buncher), swamp mats, mowers (exerts a ground pressure &lt; 8 psi and mulches mows woody stems up to 6" SBH), transport equipment (grapple skidder, forwarded, clam bunk), and cable skidder.</p>
<p>The contract may require a performance bond (Standard Form 25) in the penal amount of $500,000 prior to commencement of work.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) is issuing this sources-sought announcement as part of a market survey for X-band radar systems and technologies relevant to a future requirement for a shipboard self-defense radar system. This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP). NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME. Industry responses will be used as an input in the formulation of acquisition approaches and plans for appropriate future investments. The identification of radar systems and relevant subsystem technologies, including X-band active phased array antennas and low phase noise, exciters / frequency synthesizers that are relatively mature (TRL-6 or higher) are a major objective of this RFI.
<p>A new X-band active array based radar system is envisioned to compliment both existing and emergent volume surveillance radar systems for horizon surveillance and tracking applications. A scalable radar design is envisioned to accommodate current and future mission requirements for multiple platforms. Although a radar system with multiple, fixed-face arrays is primarily of interest, a design that can additionally support single or back to back faces in a rotating variant is also of interest.</p>
<p>This sources sought is seeking interested parties that may have developed or are currently producing X-band active array radar systems or supporting active array antenna and low phase noise exciter / frequency synthesizer subsystems that have the potential to meet the emergent X-band radar requirements. This approach could include marinizing of land based, or possibly airborne, radars. Industry responses will be used as an input in the formulation of acquisition approaches and plans for appropriate future investments.</p>
<p>This sources sought is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is a single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access the information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.</p>
<p>It is envisioned that system requirements and white paper responses to this notice may be divided into two categories:</p>
<p>a. X-band Radar System Concepts, Active Antenna Technologies, and Architecture<br />b. X-band Receiver / Exciter / Frequency Synthesizer Technologies</p>
<p>White paper responses to the System Concepts, Active Antenna Technologies, and Architecture aspects of the envisioned X-band radar system should concentrate on the following system functionalities:</p>
<p>a. Low flying threat / Anti-Ship Cruise Missile firm track range <br />b. Missile illumination capability including effective radiated power and duration<br />c. Missile communications capability (uplink and downlink)<br />d. Periscope detection<br />e. Surface surveillance and tracking<br />f. Dedicated tracking throughout the hemispherical coverage area from the sea surface through the zenith</p>
<p>For each concept addressing the functionalities above the responses must address the technical performance attributes of the system, including peak and average power, duty cycle, system losses, antenna gains, antenna sidelobe levels, instantaneous and tunable bandwidth, dynamic range, clutter rejection capability as illustrated with either clutter attenuation or clutter improvement factor, a Blake chart illustrating performance (for complete radar systems), and size/weight/ power and cost. For systems that have not yet been fielded, an assessment of the maturity of the concept illustrating at least TRL-6 maturity is desired.</p>
<p>White paper responses to the X-band Receiver / Exciter / Frequency Synthesizer Technologies aspects of the envisioned X-band radar system should concentrate on the following attributes:</p>
<p>a. Tunable frequency coverage<br />b. Phase noise<br />c. Frequency switching speed<br />d. Correlated / uncorrelated spurious signal (including harmonics) content<br />e. Size / weight / power and cost<br />f. Reliability and fault tolerance<br />g. Waveform capabilities, including minimum / maximum pulse width, pulse repetition frequency, instantaneous bandwidth<br />h. Control interface</p>
<p>For Receiver / Exciter / Frequency Synthesizer systems that have not yet been fielded, an assessment of the maturity of the concept illustrating at least TRL-6 maturity is desired.</p>
<p>Request for Capabilities Statements-<br />Interested parties are invited to submit responses addressing the following information, as applicable to the topic areas above:</p>
<p>1. A positive statement of interest to submit a proposal as a contractor on a future solicitation for this system.<br />2. Company name and address, point(s) of contact with phone number(s).<br />3. Technical Approach.<br />4. Current TRL level of the X-band Radar System Concept<br />5. Current TRL level of the X-band Receiver / Exciter / Frequency Synthesizer Technologies<br />6. If the current TRL of the Radar System Concept is below TRL 6 discuss the risks and schedule necessary to achieve a TRL 6<br />7. If the current TRL of the Receiver / Exciter / Frequency Synthesizer Technologies is below TRL 6 discuss the risks and schedule necessary to achieve a TRL 6<br />8. Government resources required.<br />9. Modularity and scalability of the system, subsystem or components as they relate to system performance, redundancy, reliability, and future opportunities for technical upgrades</p>
<p>Additionally, the response shall identify the respondent's business size and any socio-economic programs that may apply.</p>
<p>Responses should not exceed 15 pages in length. The data received in response to this RFI is for information purposes only and does not mandate or impose requirements or commit the Government or vendor to any action. It is recognized that proprietary data may be included with the information provided. Clearly mark all proprietary information.</p>
<p>Classified responses are permitted with prior notification. NSWCDD, Code 025 must be notified in writing 5 working days prior to submission of any classified responses.</p>
<p>CLASSIFIED questions shall be handled through the NSWCDD Security POC. Specifically, any entity wanting to ask a CLASSIFIED question shall send an email to the NSWCDD Security POC with a copy to both the Technical POC and the Business POC stating that the entity would like to ask a CLASSIFIED question. DO NOT EMAIL ANY CLASSIFIED QUESTIONS. The Security POC will contact the entity and arrange for the CLASSIFIED question to be submitted through a secure method of communication.</p>
<p>Note: The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied, or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. All information and data received in response to the sources sought marked or designated as corporate proprietary information will be fully protected and held in strict confidence.</p>
<p>No telephone responses will be accepted. Responses must be received no later than NOON EST on Friday&nbsp;13&nbsp;November 2015 via e-mail to kim.carter@navy.mil. Responses should reference "X BAND RF RADAR."</p>
<p>Information submitted is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to provide any items or services. Questions pertaining to this Sources Sought Announcement Number N00178-16-R-2002 shall be directed to the attention of kim.carter@navy.mil. NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME AND THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT BASED ON THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SUBMITTED.</p>

<DESC>1. Pursuant to FAR 13.106-1 (b) "Soliciting from a single source". The National Research Council of the National Academy of Science (NAS) derives its long-established status as a non-competitive source of scientific research and policy advice to the Government from its creation by Congress in 1863 (36 U.S.C. Sec. 253). This special status and relationship with the Government was reconfirmed by Executive Order (E.O.) 2859, May 11, 1918, as amended by E.O. 10668, May 10, 1956. The noncompetitive status of the Academy was most recently formally affirmed in E.O. 12832 on January 19, 1993. This order cites the special relationship of the Academy to the Government and its unique capacity to marshal scientific expertise of the highest caliber in order to provide independent and objective science policy advice.<br /><br />NAS is a unique national resource situated to harness the Nation's most eminent scholars and expertise from around the country without compensation on committees and boards and provide insight and advice on pressing science and technology policy questions. It brings together leaders from academe, industry, government, and other sectors to address critical national issues and provide cogent, unbiased advice to the government and citizens of the United States. The institution has developed an array of approaches for addressing the variety of problems and policy questions that come before it. The end products take many forms: among them, written reports reflecting the deliberations and conclusions of an expert study committee; symposia and other opportunities for decision-makers to discuss national issues; proceedings from conferences and workshops; and "white papers" on policy issues of special interest. Most projects are conducted or overseen by a committee with a diverse range of expertise covering all aspects of the subject.
<p>With unparalleled objectivity, NAS is uniquely qualified to provide the measure of Expertise, independence and audience acceptance necessary to meet the program requirements. NAS stands alone in its level of expertise and capacity required to complete the proposed study on the ethical and social policy issues raised by the recent development of novel methods to develop a collaborative, information technology laboratory capability that facilitates systems research, technology development, testing, and evaluation related to public alerts and warnings. <br />Literature review and discussion with Government program officials and private industry consistently identify the NAS as uniquely capable of performing this requirement.</p>
<p>2. Determination and Period of Performance:<br />Given the complexity of the issues from regulatory, scientific and financial perspectives, the NAS is the only organization that can access leading medical, scientific, bioethicist and regulatory expertise while maintaining objectivity and independence which is required for this effort. A time and materials order will be negotiated and awarded under the PSC ordering agreement with the National Academy of Sciences. The anticipated period of performance shall be for eighteen (18) months from date of award.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform this requirement.</p>
<p>3. Background, Strategy and Scope: <br />DHS S&amp;T established the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) Program within the First Responders Group Office for Interoperability and Compatibility, herein after referred to as FRG OIC, to develop a collaborative, information technology laboratory capability that facilitates systems research, technology development, testing, and evaluation related to public alerts and warnings. The WEA RDT&amp;E Program faces the organizational challenge of aligning the efforts of a diverse research community in the public and private sectors with specific legislative mandates and national security goals.</p>
<p>3.1 Strategy for the Objective: <br />The purpose of this sole source contract is to assemble a committee of approximately 12 experts across relevant disciplines, including technologists, social scientists, and emergency managers who would be appointed by the National Research Council to carry out this study. That committee would meet approximately 4-5 times over the course of 12 months to obtain briefings, deliberate, and prepare a consensus report.</p>
<p>3.2 Tactics to Achieve the Objective:<br />The NAS has convened three workshops under DHS sponsorship, one focused on alerting on cell phones, one considering the use of social media, and one looking at geographical targeting of alerts and warnings. The proposed activity would draw, in part, on this earlier work and on results from DHS-sponsored research.</p>
<p>3.3 Scope:<br />This effort is comprised of a review of current knowledge about how to effectively deploy and use emergency alerts and warnings and explore future research needs. A workshop and additional information-gathering meetings will be convened to capture results from recent research to include work sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate and to foster dialog among technologists, social science researchers, and emergency managers. The study committee's report would summarize results from the DHS research, provide an overview of current knowledge about emergency alerts and warnings, and set forth an interdisciplinary agenda for research that would highlight gaps and future needs. This effort cannot be obtained as conveniently or economically by contracting directly with the private sector because the work is better suited for the Federal Government and academia, which has, over the past number of years, been working with key researchers in this area.</p>
<p>4. Board Director: <br />Must be a recognized industry expert possessing a doctor of medicine, doctor of philosophy or equivalent degree and possess extensive experience in conducting similar projects that establish an evidence base for sourcing an emergency alerts and warning platform. The candidate must have at least 15 years of experience in a medical/scientific discipline and must be generally known for his or her experience through published articles/scholarly works; oral presentations at seminars, conferences and peer groups; or through other widely known venues.</p>
<p>5. The Study Committee: <br />The contractor will appoint a Steering Committee of between 11 and 13 experts across relevant disciplines, including technologists, social scientists, and emergency managers to include a chair or chairs. This committee will meet four to five times, either in person or by teleconference, over the course of 18 months to obtain briefings, deliberate, and prepare a consensus report. Committee reports will be created following each meeting.</p>
<p>5.1 Study Kickoff Meeting: DHS S&amp;T's First Responders Group (FRG) Office for Interoperability and Compatibility (OIC) will be invited to present and discuss its goals and expectations to the committee. An initial set of briefers will provide the study committee with background and context. The contractor will consult with FRG OIC regarding these briefings. The committee will begin planning for the workshop and subsequent activities. A Plan of Action and Milestones will be created. Regular meeting reports will be delivered.</p>
<p>5.2 Workgroup Meetings: The workshop will include several keynote speakers to provide an overall framing of issues and several panels to present and discuss current and potential technology solutions, research, and open questions. A closing session will include summary remarks by panel moderators and time for open discussion. The workshop will involve approximately 20 invited speakers and another 25 invited participants, and will be open to the public on a space-available basis. The contractor will consult with FRG OIC for its input on proposed speakers and panelists prior to inviting them to participate. Additionally, the contractor will keep FRG OIC apprised of speaker and panelist acceptances or denials and discuss any replacements that may be necessary.</p>
<p>5.3 The contractor will engage with speakers and panelists ahead of the workshop to ensure that presentations are aligned with the workshop goals and discussion topics. Speakers and panelists will be recognized experts in the fields of information and communications technologies, services, and applications; geographic information; public safety and homeland security.</p>
<p>5.4 Following the workshop, the contractor will make an unedited transcript of the workshop available to the public as well as provide a copy of the transcript to OIC within approximately 30 days of the event.</p>
<p>6. Prepare Final Report. As a check on the quality and objectivity of the study, all contractor reports would undergo a rigorous, independent external review by experts whose comments are provided anonymously to the committee members. The contractor recruits independent experts with a range of views and perspectives to review and comment on the draft report prepared by the committee. Once the final report experts complete that review process, it will be delivered to the DHS S&amp;T Contracting Officer via email, transmitted to FRG OIC, and made available to the public shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>7. This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>8. All responsible sources that have the requisite qualifications to perform the work above may submit a statement of capabilities via e-mail to mary.fouser@psc.hhs.gov, which will be will be reviewed solely to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The e-mail subject line must reference: 165619 Capability Statement Submission. Responses must be double-spaced with 1" margins on all sides and use a standard font no smaller than 12 point.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in November.
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.secure.force.com/AAAP. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>The Open Period for November is November 1, 2015 to November 20, 2014, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice for Plating Shop Renovation, Building 3001, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma: W912BV-15-R-0093. The previous solicitation pertaining to this notice, W912BV-15-R-0053, was canceled due to changes in selection factors and going from a two-phase to one-phase selection process. <br /><br />The actual solicitation will be posted no earlier than 10/9/15 and before 10/20/15, with proposals due approximately 30-days later. <br /><br />This is a single-phase, design-bid-build (fully designed by government contracted A/E firm), construction contract solicitation with full and open competition, a rough order of magnitude of&nbsp;MORE THAN $25,000,000 and an estimated 1903-day period of performance. Final award scheduled for February-March of 2016. <br /><br />This project involves renovating the existing 40,000 square foot plating shop located within Building 3001, including: new chemical process tanks (approximately 180 tanks); replacing the operating floor; replacing roof-mounted scrubbers/exhaust fans; and recoating the entire shop. As part of this effort, power, lighting, Reverse Osmosis (RO) water system, process controls and other utility systems supporting the process lines will require modifications and replacement. The new process lines are as follows: <br />Chrome Plating <br />Nickel Plating <br />Prep and Neutralization, including Alkaline Cleaning, Neutralization and Black Oxide <br />Electroless Nickel <br />Wax Removal <br />Stripping <br />MG Coatings <br />Alodine and Anodize <br />Zinc Nickel Chromate <br />Copper/Nickel/Silver <br />Borazon <br />Phasing will be an important aspect to the project. The project will be constructed in multiple phases, each focusing on particular process line areas. It is important to note that all plating shop activities will be operational throughout construction. Demolition in a particular process area will not occur until the new duplicate process area is installed and operational. The design documents will outline the specific requirements for the phasing of the demolition and construction. <br />An additional area located adjacent to the Plating Shop, called the Wax/Dewax Shop, will receive some renovation. This work includes: temperature elements and steam valves to be connected to the new plating shop process control system; removal of a degreaser system; renovation of controls on two ovens; replace two dry blast cabinets with four new cabinets; and replace overhead lighting. <br />A new process instrumentation and control system will be installed for the plating shop tank processes, ventilation, and utilities. The new system will allow process history to be recorded. Wax tank temperature elements and steam valves as well as oven controls in the wax/dewax area will also be connected to the system. This will include fully redundant central programmable logic controllers (PLC) to serve the entire shop. Human machine interface (HMI) graphic terminals and software will be provided to allow part tracking and all process functions related to individual parts. Input/output (I/O) panels will be provided throughout the plating shop operating floor for connection of analog and digital devices. Instruments to be connected include: temperature elements, conductivity elements, level elements, control valves, pressure transmitters, utility meters, stack lights and horns. Current and voltage for each rectifier will also be recorded. <br /><br />A small business subcontracting plan will be required.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to notify industry that the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B). This notice of intent applies to three separate actions.
<p>The Government has three requirements described below that have been supported under our Global Battlestaff and Program Support (GBPS) contracts since 2010. These three requirements will be the first/original requirements to transition to our SOF-Wide Mission Support (SWMS) Group A contracts. Due to an extended acquisition timeline and multiple protests, SWMS Group A is not yet available. The contracted services described below are mission critical and this support cannot lapse. As such, the Government intends to issue three purchase orders to bridge this critical support for a period of 6 months allowing the SWMS Group A contracts to clear protests. The purchase orders will be issued under NAICS 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services with a size standard of $15M.</p>
<p>The Three requirements are:</p>
<p>(1) Regional Magazine Initiative support of publications and collateral print media. The purchase order will be issued to Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc., 8283 Greensboro Drive, McLean, VA 22102. The estimated cost of this purchase order is $800K.</p>
<p>(2) Technical and programmatic support to Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Special Reconnaissance and Surveillance and Exploitation (SRSE). The purchase order will be issued to Jacobs Technology, Inc., 5401 W. Kennedy Blvd., Suite 900, Tampa, FL 33609. The estimated cost of this purchase order is $650K.</p>
<p>(3) Technical and programmatic support to PEO Maritime. The purchase order will be issued to SRA International, Inc., 4300 Fair Lakes Ct., Fairfax, VA 22033. The estimated cost of this purchase order is $2M.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, all responses received within seven days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A change in the strategy detailed above based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Correspondence in response to this notice shall be submitted to contracting@socom.mil and be identified with H92222BRIDGES in the subject line.</p>

<DESC>The scope of this effort is to develop and acquire a construction contact that includes furnishing all equipment and materials and performing all labor and supervision for the following, but not limited to: Work includes an operations and maintenance hangar with shops, company administration, aircraft container storage, organizational vehicle parking. Work also includes asphalt overlay of the existing runway, taxiway, and access apron. Sewage generated will be disposed of via a septic system and leach fields. Currently, there are no facilities existing on Fort Irwin to accommodate the stationing of a new Unmanned Aircraft Systems Hangar. The runway at Goldstone is the only paved runway on the installation, and has been selected as the least cost alternative for the Grey Eagle at the NTC and is located approximately 15 miles from the Fort Irwin Cantonment area. This project will accommodate a new mission for an Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) company (D229th) to train alongside rotations going through the National Training Center to expand the training requirement to supplement combat units integrating UAS components in theater in support of Overseas Contingency Operations.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
528-16-1-7803-0014	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
None




	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$143,345.00 (base year and 4 option years)

2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

A service maintenance plan for the following Bayer MedRad equipment: four (4) Provis Angiographic Injectors, one (1) Spectris Solaris MR Injector, two (2) Stellant D CT Injectors, and two (2) Veris Injectors located at the Syracuse VAMC, which  consists of: on-site service support and  one annual preventative maintenance service to include all travel, labor and parts expenses. 


3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

Bayer Healthcare LLC is the only company that provides firm fixed price service maintenance plans for all of the Med Rad media injector models list in the previous section located at the Syracuse VA Medical center.


4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
Market research has indicated that there are companies that repair Med Rad Media injectors, however  through market research I have not been able to identify a Bayer Healthcare authorized service provider that can support all of the media injector models present at the Syracuse VA Medical center.
5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
A review of the previous procurement of this requirement was awarded as a task order off of Bayer Healthcare LLC's FSS contract (V797P-5058B). A review of this FSS contract identified that this contract does not have any line items that can be used to procure this requirement, therefore this procurement shall not be procured as a task order under this FSS contract. A  Search of Schedule 65IIA, Category A-200 indicates that there are no FSS contracts that have line items for Med-Rad media injector service agreements. A search in CCST for "Med Rad media injector maintenance" also did not result in the identification of any FSS contracts that contained line items that could meet this requirement. 
A search of NAICS code "811219" and key words "Media  Injector" resulted in 8 vendors that could possibly meet the procurements requirements. After reviewing the profiles of each of these companies, none of them could meet the procurements requirements.
A Google search for "med rad media injector service maintenance" identified two possible companies, Coeur Inc. and Precise Biomedical Inc., that could meet the requirements of this procurement.  I contacted both companies and both indicated that they did not support all of the models to serviced under this agreement.
A sources sought notice (VA528-15-N-0276) was posted on FBO for 30 days and did not receive any written responses

6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
