<p>Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;PURPOSE OF REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:</p>
<p><br />The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to assist the BLS as it conducts a market research for a mail survey for a sample of approximately 86 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) through out the country. The BLS is conducting market research on the feasibility of contracting this mail screening survey out to a vendor on the GSA MOBIS schedule. The BLS is requesting information on your capabilities and experience in designing and conducting mail surveys of this type.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the total sample of address supplied by the BLS for the mail survey will be approximately 40,000 to 50,000 households in a number of cities across the US, including Alaska and Hawaii. It will be broken into two groups per year, one small group of a few thousand households and a larger group of the remaining address. At this time we expect that the questionnaire and general survey methodology will be designed at BLS and the contractor would be responsible for printing (including materials and supplies), mailing, and compiling the results. We would also like to know about your capabilities in advising us on questionnaire and survey design.</p>

<DESC>********* This is an amendment to the original sources sought.  The correction has been capitilized below. ***********
This is a Sources Sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.   All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside is warranted or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.  
The Bureau of Reclamation is experiencing interference on an existing spread spectrum 2.4GHz (2.400 to 2.4835 GHz) 4-T-1 microwave radio system and is seeking a solution that would avoid having to change out expensive antenna and wave guide equipment and avoid having to rotate the antennas. Reclamation is interested in testing a pair of state of the art 2.4GHz 4-T1 spread spectrum radios that are designed to resolve interference problems.  The radios should provide fine-tuning capability across the entire frequency band and have many center frequencies of operation.  THE  RADIOS SHOULD HAVE A RECEIVER THRESHOLD (GUARANTEED OVER TEMPERATURE ABOUT bed EQUAL 10 TO POWER -6), OPERATING TEMPERATURE -40 TO + 65 DEGREES C, -40 TO +149 DEGREES F, AND FULL SPEC TEMPERATURE -25 TO +60 DEGREES C, -13 TO +140 DEGREES F.  The microwave radios should also have an on board spectrum analyzer to help with resolving the interference problem.  Reclamation is seeking a 30 day product demonstration at the Drop 2 reservoir construction along Interstate Highway 8 in Imperial County, California approximately 30 miles east of El Centro, California, and 25 miles west of Yuma, Arizona. If during the 30 day test the radios do not resolve the interference problem the Bureau of Reclamation must be allowed to return the radios at no cost.  Reclamation will fund return shipping costs.               
Firms interested in participating in the above procurement are invited to submit capability statements in response to this request. The capabilities package submitted should demonstrate the firm's ability, capability, and suggested product solutions.  Packages should include the following information:  (1) Firm's name, address, telephone and fax numbers, business size and type ( 8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran, Small Business, Large Business, etc.), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number; (2) Product information; (3) a commitment to participate in a 30 day product demonstration; (4) Commercial Terms and Conditions including payment provisions and intervals.  Capability statements are due not later than March 12th, 2009 12pm PST.   All responses to this Sources Sought notice shall be provided via electronic submission.  Email or faxed responses may be submitted to Meagan Fyffe ph: (702) 293-8552, fax (702) 293-8499, or email to mfyffe@lc.usbr.gov.

 [SOLE SOURCE EXPLANATION] NASA/DFRC intends to lease the items from Ideal Aerosmith. There are alimited number of rate tables available with the proper accuracy andspecifications required to support CEV PA-1 phasing tests.

<DESC>EXPRESSION OF INTEREST SOUGHT

Requirement: 

The United States Government Farm Service Agency currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Ross County, Ohio located at 475 Western Avenue, Chillicothe, Ohio, that will be expiring November 30, 2009. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 6,636 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 6,320 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years. The space must be available for occupancy by December 1, 2009. The delineated area is North bounded by: US Route 35; East bounded by: US Route 23; South bounded by US Route 50 (aka Western Avenue); West bounded by Veterans Parkway. 

Other applicable requirements include: 

 Parking: 52 on site paved parking spaces. 

 Others. 

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) plans to procure on a sole source basis services regarding Just-in-time Accession of Clinically Annotated Pathology Specimens for Molecular Marker Research with Geisinger Health System, Center for Health Research; 100 N Academy Avenue; Danville, PA 17822.</p>
<p>The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541690 and the business size standard is $7M.</p>
<p>Only one award shall be made as a result of this solicitation.  Period of Performance shall be at award through seven (7) months.</p>
<p>The purpose of the requirement is to test a peer-to-peer informatics system to locate and retrieve specimens and pertinent clinical and outcome data on an as needed (just-in-time) basis from community health care settings. Harvard University developed and tested an open-source, peer-to-peer computer system program to identify pathologic specimens and associated clinical outcome data in clinic and hospital settings. The system includes software developed to remove personal identifiers, a de-identification system that has been shown to work in an academic setting.</p>
<p>The Center for Health Research, Geisinger Health System/Clinic will test this system in an HMO providing care to nearly 500,000 members in scores of communities in Pennsylvania. A companion test is underway in another HMO, Kaiser Northwest, located in a large metropolitan area in Portland, Oregon.  The Center for Health Research (CRN), Geisinger Health System, is a member of the HMO Cancer Research Network. The evaluation activity has the potential to substantially enhance the capability of the CRN, and other research networks, for conducting multi-site cancer control research involving pathological specimens and associated clinical/outcome data.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:  1) Identify cases with: available pathologic specimens AND which have been registered in the local site's Cancer Registry AND for which reasonable follow-up is available; 2) Prepare a database of eligible cases in SQL format;  3) Process the "Summary Data" databases to prepare them for scrubbing; 4) Scrub the extracted databases in an iterative manner until adequate (&gt;99% effectiveness) is achieved; 5) Test scrubber on other data-EMR, pathology, radiology, in-patient notes; 6) Perform test searches of scrubbed data based on NCI will provided test parameters;  7) Queried for further annotations in HMO databases.</p>
<p>The Center for Health Research, Geisinger Clinic is uniquely qualified to carry out this effort because of its organization as an HMO, its commitment to health research and participation in the Cancer Research Network (CRN) of the NCI, extensive computerization of health records, considerable pathologic resources, and its willingness to explore new methods of finding and accessing pathologic material for molecular research.  Although other members of the CRN have collections of archival specimens and electronic health records, the Geisinger Health System has a system comparable to the one in Kaiser North West which will permit the NCI along with Harvard to determine the site specific modifications that would be needed if the system were to expand further.  The government knows of no other tested computer program.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Contractor shall provide one (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 AM ET March 24, 2009.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed or emailed to the following: Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or fax 301-402-4513.  It is the contractors' responsibility to ensure all questions have been received in the contracting office.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certifications in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certification Application (ORCA).  Please reference NCI-90068-NG on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Description:  The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Design and Construction Excellence in Public Buildings.  GSA anticipates using funds from the pending FY 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act for this project.  [Subject to the Availability of Funds].  
Project Summary:  The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design and Construction Excellence in public architecture, engineering and construction through a Design-Build contract, which shall include the performance of architectural/engineering services, based on bridging-design documents, in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements, for the new Department of Homeland Securitys (DHS) U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Headquarters facility, including a 990 space parking structure, at the West Campus of St. Elizabeths, in Southeast Washington, D.C.  As required by law, the facility will meet federal energy goals, including the new standards mandated by EPAct 2005, the Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards, and specified security requirements.  The project will meet LEED-NC Silver rating requirements. 

The USCG Headquarters project will be located on the site of St. Elizabeths, a National Historic Landmark, and former mental health hospital that was previously operated by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  The St. Elizabeths Campus is located on Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue in the Anacostia neighborhood of Southeast Washington, D.C.  The West Campus and a portion of the East Campus have been selected to meet the operational housing needs for the DHS.  The West Campus, a 176-acre site, is situated on the topographic bowl of the District of Columbia and offers panoramic views of the city.  The campus contains 62 historic buildings, 134 character defining landscape features and a historic cemetery, in which soldiers from the Civil War era, as well as former patients, are interred.  Prospective Offerors experience must include, but is not limited to, work performed on historic sites, with the National Historic Preservation Acts Section 106 Process, and within campus settings.

The estimated cost for the design-build delivery of the USCG Headquarters and related infrastructure upgrades is between $300,000,000.00 and $400,000,000.00.

The USCG Headquarters is expected to be approximately 1,100,000 gross square feet (GSF) and will meet high performance green building design criteria..  The GSA is the lead federal agency for the delivery of this facility.  

The design-build scope of work includes architectural, engineering, construction, security, commissioning and other related services necessary to construct the new USCG Headquarters building.  Related services include, but are not limited to, site planning and infrastructure, geotechnical evaluation and monitoring, archaeological monitoring, permitting, testing and inspection during construction, commissioning and potential additional geotechnical analysis of the site.  The design will conform to GSA Design and Construction Excellence requirements.  Preliminary consultations have taken place, and are ongoing, with the National Capital Planning Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts, the State Historic Preservation Office, and various other reviewing agencies in the metropolitan area for the current bridging design.  Additional submissions will be required by the Contractor to secure final design approvals.

Procurement Strategy:   GSA intends to award a firm-fixed-price Design-Build Contract based on completed bridging design documents for the new USCG Headquarters to be located in Washington, DC, pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3, and the GSA Design Excellence Program.  For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two.  The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a short list of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals (the short list will be published in FedBizOpps).  All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal.  A maximum of five (5) Design-Build entities (herein referred to as Offerors) will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to a Request for Proposals (RFP)).

In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors.  Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ.  The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the phase two process.  Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.     

In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals.  Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with Part 15, and include phase-two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with 15.304.  Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with Part 15.  The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.  

The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about March 23, 2009, on the Internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.   

GSA has engaged Perkins+Will (P+W) and its professional consultants of Chicago, IL and Washington, D.C. for the preparation of architectural,  engineering and landscaping bridging design documents. P+W is also preparing site studies, project specific design criteria and building program, and is assisting with portions of the Design-Build solicitation (RFP).

Opportunities for Other than Large Businesses:   This procurement will be open to large and small business firms.  Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor, or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor.  Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)), FAR Subpart 19.702 and FAR Subpart 19.12, an Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, veteran owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.  In this procurement, GSA intends to promote contractors and subcontractors' use of registered Apprenticeship Programs. 

Although not mandatory, firms are requested to affix their names to the Interested Vendors Listing for this requirement and register to receive notifications.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Research, Development & Engineering Command (RDECOM) Contracting Center intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price contract for 95,000 rounds of APM2 and 15,000 rounds of B32.  PM SEQ is primarily interested in procuring the actual projectile (or bullet) but will accept complete rounds.  Project Manager Soldier Equipment (PM SEQ) requires delivery of all the rounds 10 days after receipt of order (ARO).  The requests for these two rounds have been a continuing and ongoing effort by PM SEQ since 2004 as the wartime requirements for Soldier body armor have increased. Both of these rounds are required for production lot acceptance and surveillance testing of Soldier personal protective equipment (PPE). APM2 and the B32 rounds provide the projectile and penetrator weight/mass material, velocity and kinetic energy characteristics required for testing.  The APM2 round is a 7.62x63mm armor piercing ammunition, the projectile of which weighs 166 grains and has a hardened steel core.  The B32 round is 7.62x54Rmm with a 155 grain armor piercing projectile.  The government reserves the right to perform destructive material testing on a sample size (up to 1%) of the projectiles as it sees fit prior to contract award.  The government will buy the test sample projectiles and fund the projectile material testing.<BR><BR>Any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification (white papers) to the Contract Specialist within 10 days from the date of the publication of this announcement.  White papers shall be sent via email, shall be one page in length, and must provide supporting evidence in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement. Responses received will be evaluated but a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Government anticipates to award a firm fixed price award to UltraSonic Systems, Inc, 135 Ward Hill Ave, Haverhill, MA  01835. One Prism 400 Photoresis Spray Coater is required. This equipment will be used in support of the Miniaturization of Missile Components.  Ultrasonic's products are the only non-custom commercially available system that has a programmable 4-axis movement spray head with additional tilt positions and can coat a 20 inch square substrate.  No other manufacturer can provide this equipment without performing non-recurring engineering and environmental qualification.  No manufacturers other than Ultrasonic can provide these assemblies without being qualified, which represents a substantial duplication of costs that would not likely be recovered through open competition, only Ultrasonic and no other source will satisfy agency requirements.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation which will be fully considered by the agency.   Point of Contact is Lisa Starbuck, Contract Specialist, telephone 256-876-3080, email lisa.starbuck@us.army.mil.

<DESC>Requirements include all plant, labor, equipment, materials, incidentals, and work to design an 'improved fish passage environment' fixed blade turbine, and for the supply of the turbine runner and appurtenant components.  Additional requirements govern the design of an 'improved fish passage environment' adjustable blade turbine, and the optional supply of the adjustable blade turbine runner and appurtenant components.  The fixed and adjustable blade runners designed under this contract are for replacement of the existing Main Units 2 and 3 turbine runners at Ice Harbor Lock and Dam Powerhouse, Brubank, Washington.<BR><BR>The contract contains two segments that pertain to both runners:  Design and Supply. <BR><BR>a.  Runner and Hydraulic Passage Design:<BR><BR>(1)  The Contractor shall work directly with the Government to develop and evaluate replacement fixed and adjustable blade runner designs, and to further develop and evaluate Government-defined modifications to stationary hydraulic structures, primarily the stay vanes and draft tube.  Modifications to other water passageway components with potential to improve the hydraulic conditions for fish may be considered throughout the design process.  <BR><BR>(2)  The hydraulic design process, and the communication between the Contractor and Government design team throughout the process, will be iterative in nature.  The iterative process will include Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), traditional performance model testing at the Contractor's facility and observational model testing at the Government's Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) model testing facility in Vicksburg, Mississippi.  The emphasis is to attain a turbine design that will minimize risk of injury to fish passing through the turbine.<BR><BR>(3)  The Contractor shall first utilize CFD to analyze the existing Ice Harbor Kaplan turbine design and then use CFD to analyze modifications to existing stationary hydraulic structures, as specified by the Government in the contract.  Utilize CFD to analyze both fixed and adjustable blade turbine designs.  The primary goal of the CFD analysis is to determine the pressure profile through the existing and replacement runner designs.<BR><BR>(4)  Design, manufacture and construct a 1:25 scale model turbine capable of incorporating modifications to existing hydraulic structures (as defined in the specifications) and replacement fixed and adjustable blade runner designs.  The model runners must be compatible with the Government's own model runner test stand located at ERDC.  The Contractor must performance model test each turbine design, prior to shipping the runner to ERDC for the Government-conducted observation model testing.<BR><BR>(5)  Although the iterative process begins with the fixed blade turbine, elements of the design of both fixed blade and adjustable blade turbines may be conducted in tandem.  At the conclusion of the iterative hydraulic design process for the fixed blade runner, and upon written approval by the Government, the Contractor shall begin the mechanical design, manufacture, and delivery of the fixed blade runner, optional discharge ring, miscellaneous accessory components, and the supply of design information and installation instructions.<BR><BR>(6)  At the completion of the iterative design process for the adjustable blade turbine design, the Government may exercise optional items for the mechanical design, manufacture, and delivery of the adjustable blade runner, discharge ring, miscellaneous accessory components, and the supply of design information and installation instructions.<BR><BR>b.  Runner Supply and Delivery:<BR><BR>(1)  The Contractor shall manufacture and deliver the fixed blade runner, optional discharge ring (if exercised by the Government), runner-to-shaft coupling fasteners, a nameplate, and Contractor-supplied component installation instructions.  The Contractor must re-design the existing blade operating mechanism to function with the Contractor's fixed blade design and provide installation instructions for the operating mechanism's modification.  If the hydraulic or prototype mechanical design involves modifications to the stay ring, stay vanes, head covers, bottom ring, or draft tube liner, the Contractor must provide prototype component design information.<BR><BR>(2)  If the Government determines to exercise the option, the Contractor must also supply and deliver the adjustable blade runner with all necessary components as indicated above, for the fixed blade runner.  A blade position indicating scale must additionally be provided.<BR><BR>(3) Field Engineering Services shall be provided during installation of the runners and components. Optional items will have associated options for Field Engineering Services. The installation of the runners and associated components will be accomplished by a future construction contract and are not part of this contract. <BR><BR>Solicitation No. W912EF-09-R-0004 will be posted to the FBO website on or about March 26, 2009. Proposals will be due approximately 60 calendar days after the solicitation is issued.

<DESC><p>NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Picosecond Pulse Labs (PSPL), of Boulder, Colorado, for the packaging of NIST supplied photodector chips with connectors.
<p>The sole source determination is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) requirement for work to investigate ways of packaging an electro-optic (EO) low temperature GaAs switch in a 1 mm connectorized form. Various combinations of connector launch design and IC pad layout will be constructed to provide data for future decisions on the design of a connectorized waveform transfer standard. Four proof of concept prototypes will be built. Picosecond Pulse Labs is the only vendor that offers a 1.0 mm connector that meets our technical requirements. Specifically, no other vendor can meet the NIST requirement for a 1.0 mm connector that has been tested above 110 GHz. For this reason, we require that one of the two 1.0 mm connectors be the proprietary connector available from PSPL. PSPL will be required to obtain a second connector type with proven performance up to 110 GHz available from another vendor for two of the prototypes. We also require access to the existing PSPL 1 mm launch designs and construction notes and licenses for NIST use of the PSPL 1 mm connector design, and information regarding optimum chip dimensions and circuit layout for optimum package performance. Delivery date shall be two months after receipt of order.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide services/equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing demonstrating impulse response of the system, to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<p>Responses from qualifed small business firms are encouraged.</p>
<p>Background<br />Within the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), GE34 is the Modeling and Simulation Division of the Systems Engineering Center (GE3). DISA/GE34 is responsible for providing modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&amp;A) services in support of DISA programs and projects. MS&amp;A services include providing network performance and traffic analysis, topology design, capacity planning of the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) IP and Transport layers, and providing military communications network M&amp;S tools (NETWARS/JCSS) to the joint DoD community. Current planning indicates that DISA/GE34 will be relocating to Fort Meade, MD from Arlington, VA in 2010/2011.</p>
<p>The IP Capacity Planning (GE341) and the Transport Modeling and Analysis (GE343) branches perform seamless network design and capacity management of the DISN Unclassified and Classified IP and transport service layers, and rapid assessments of "what-if" scenarios. The work requires precise models of the DISN and moreover expert understanding of the multiple layers of the DISN and their interrelationships. Key elements of this work are DISN IP and Transport models employing OPNET's products and applying these to provide results truly useful to the network managers.</p>
<p>Roles of the Enterprise Analysis branch's (GE344) include project manager of the Joint Communications Simulation System (JCSS), and providing modeling and analysis in support of end-to-end systems engineering. GE344 executes JCSS objectives, which are to provide common modeling environment, model military and commercial communications systems, support reuse of Service and jointly developed models and leverage the capabilities of the COTS tools. <br />Requirement</p>
<p><br />DISA requires technical support to:</p>
<p>&bull; Utilize communications MS&amp;A tools and techniques to support performance assessments and capacity planning of the IP, transport and optical layers of the DISN, and resolution of GIG issues</p>
<p><br />&bull; Establish common communications M&amp;S capabilities including communication device models (CDMs) allowing for rapid construction, what-if drills, and modifications to GIG and warfighter architectures.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Support the development and modification of warfighter communication plans</p>

<p><br />&bull; Establish standards to ensure that CDMs and IERs built by different Services and Agencies will interoperate</p>
<p><br />&bull; Provide critical support to the JCSS Project Management Office:<br />o Develop the JCSS software and communication device models, based on OPNET Technologies' proprietary software. JCSS releases need integration with OPNET software products, requiring modification of OPNET proprietary software code, requiring experience in JCSS and its supporting associated OPNET modeling and simulation products ( e.g., . IT Guru, IT Modeler, and ACE)<br />o Conduct IV&amp;V for each new JCSS release and device model, to include static and dynamic testing to ensure Model Development Guide (MDG) compliance. Analyze software code complexity and track test coverage using McCabe to work with both JCSS and OPNET proprietary code. Customize JCSS software in a form for performing military communications planning.<br />o Conduct IV&amp;V of the EPLRS and Link-16 model behavior in the JCSS simulation environment using operational scenarios.<br />o Provide continued JCSS user technical support, to include guiding users in analyzing their network scenarios.<br />o Support and develop JCSS training courseware, and support to on-site or off-site training.<br />o Develop/support technical documentation, reports and presentations.

<DESC>This notice serves as public announcement that United States Postal Service (USPS) is seeking to pre-qualify sources for participation in future competitive acquisitions for selection of contractors to provide and complete audit services for a third party logistics provider for the Non-Mail Freight Team. The Non-Mail Freight Team utilizes two third party logistics providers to maintain a logistics network for the transportation of freight throughout the United States Postal Services network.  Historically, the third party logistics providers complete between 25,000 and 60,000 transactions per year for the Non-Mail Freight Team.  The purpose of the audit is to serve as an independent check of the transactions provided by the third party logistics providers.  The United States Postal Service would like a supplier with specific skills in developing and implementing written procedures for the independent review of invoices to confirm the shipping and receipt of good and services and to ensure accurate payment.  Suppliers that have experience in this type of work can submit documentation showing specific experience of this kind as well as a proposal of the work to be completed for the United States Postal Service.  Along with this documentation, the United States Postal Service will be completing the prequalification process to identify suppliers capable of completing the proposed service. 


Prequalification is the process of up-front identification of top-quality suppliers able to compete for specific types of contract opportunities. Selection of the appropriate suppliers is critical to the Postal Service's success. This augments the Postal Service's ability to deliver high-quality and innovative services to its customers and reduces operational risks. Pre-qualifying suppliers enhances competition, ensures quality performance, and can also shorten cycle time and strengthen relationships between the Postal Service and its suppliers.

For the purpose of this potential solicitation, the prequalification will include the following.  
	The supplier must be a registered corporation in the United States of America.
	The supplier must have at least three years of freight auditing experience. 
	The supplier must provide an income statement and balance sheet for at least one year of service.
	The supplier is to provide the number of employees and office locations within the United States.  
 

The USPS intends to pre-qualify an adequate number of suppliers whose record of performance in the marketplace (commercial or governmental or both) have demonstrated their ability to consistently perform to high standards of quality and reliability. All qualified suppliers may not be placed on the pre-qualified list if the purchase team determines (1) that a smaller group will provide adequate competition or (2) that some suppliers are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding purchase opportunities for the less qualified. It is the intent of USPS to use this pre-qualified suppliers list for future solicitations for certain Non-Mail Freight Transportation contracts over a 3 year period following the completion of this prequalification. 

Pre-qualification Criteria: The USPS will evaluate a firms pre-qualification submission against each of the Prequalification Evaluation requirements listed above.  Pre-qualification responses will be due by 1:00 PM (EST) March 31, 2009. All questions and comments regarding any aspect of this notice must be sent by email to SURTRANCMC_SM@usps.gov or by facsimile addressed to the attention of the Freight Audit Team at 202-268-7473 by 03/20/09 not later than 1:00 PM (EST). Pre-qualification does not constitute a contract award.  Any interested firms and incumbent suppliers who have previously been pre-qualified must submit a response to this notice in order to be considered for this prequalification opportunity. This announcement does not in any way commit the USPS to the reimbursement of any proposal cost or expense, or otherwise create an obligation on the part of the USPS. The USPS is not obligated to award any contract as a result of this announcement.

<DESC><BR>The Government is seeking sources for the development of a system to provide Automatic Aim-Point Targeting Technology with Enhanced Imaging.  This system will enable a Soldier to aim a Thermal Weapon Sight equipped weapon without looking through the weapon sight and without losing the situational awareness provided by his head mounted night vision goggle.<BR><BR>The system is envisioned to consist of weapon mounted sensors/electronics, an image processing module, a digitally based helmet mounted night vision goggle (NVG) and all cabling necessary to interconnect these items.  The system must be compatible with the following Thermal Weapon Sights (TWS) without modification, AN/PAS-13C/D/E.  The NVG shall be compatible with all sizes of the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) without modification of the helmet and without compromising the protective qualities of the helmet.  The NVG must also allow for ballistic eyewear to be worn with the system.  The system shall have the capability to display the TWS imagery co-registered with the NVG imagery in the NVG eyepiece whenever the fields of view of the two devices overlap.  When the fields of view of the two systems do not coincide, then the system shall indicate within the NVG eyepiece where the TWS is pointing relative to the NVG.  The system shall have a mode of operation able to display unmodified TWS imagery in the NVG eyepiece either as the entire field of view or as a picture-in-picture.  Selection of mission critical user modes shall be through a weapon mounted control.<BR><BR>This request is to determine industrys capability to develop and build one reflexive aiming system within twelve months.  The Government intends to furnish a single TWS, either an AN/PAS-13 C, D, or E, as Government Furnished Equipment to support this effort.

<DESC><p>Description<br />CREATE-AV Support<br />Response Date: 24 April 2009<br />NAICS Code: 541712<br />The Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office (AFSEO) Kestrel Software Development Team (46 SK/SKI), Eglin AFB, FL is contemplating a sole source firm fixed price contract to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB); 701 20th Street South; Birmingham, AL 35294. The requirement is for accurate computational science and engineering (CSE) tools to support its flight certification activity. CSE tools aid AFSEO in determining safe flight envelopes for new stores/aircraft and safe separation of stores during flight test, as well as diagnosing issues discovered during flight test.<br />The anticipated award date is June 2009. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code for this effort is 541712; size standard in number of employees is 500.<br />The Computational Research and Engineering Acquisition Tools and Environments Program (CREATE) is managed out of the DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program Office (DoD HPCMP). Its goal is to produce CSE software to improve acquisition cost, timeline, and delivered system performance. The Kestrel simulation tool is a CREATE product that will be used to achieve these goals for fixed wing aircraft. To realize the full potential of Kestrel and to provide the CSE capability that the AFSEO needs to perform its mission, additional modifications, upgrades, and enhancements of Kestrel's infrastructure and executive (KIE) and underlying components of AVUS, 6 degree of freedom motion generator, structural dynamics, flight control system modeling, and propulsion need to be added to the core High Performance Computing (HPC) capability of Kestrel. Also, case management capabilities need to be added to Kestrel to allow management of hundreds to thousands of jobs to be processed simultaneously.<br />This current effort is sponsored by the DoD HPCMP CREATE Program and requires specific documentation and software development practices of their sponsored projects.<br />The principal objective of this contract effort is to provide the ability to solve realistically sized full aircraft system problems of high resolution using distributed memory architecture on HPC systems at the DoD Major Shared Resource Centers (MSRC). These MSRCs typically have distributed systems on the order of 10,000 cores/processors and developed software needs to be able to take advantage of core/processor counts on the order of one-fourth of the machine in the near term and the full machine over the next several years. This objective is achieved by implementing Kestrel enhancements that improve parallel performance and add to the baseline CFD solver the capabilities of aircraft prescribed motion, free to respond 6DoF motion, aeroelastic interactions, flight control system response including control surfaces, and propulsion effects in a modular way. The fundamental goal of this project is to improve Kestrel performance on HPC systems and to expand its capabilities through modifications, upgrades, and enhancements.<br />UAB possesses the unique skills, expertise, and extensive experience in the computational science and engineering (CSE) tools. Additionally, through their Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Computational Structural Mechanics (CSM), and Enabling Technology (ET) research centers, UAB has developed a number of stand-alone applications as well as supporting code modules that are of critical importance to the CREATE-AV/Kestrel project. These include: CaseMan, HYB3D, AVUS Flow Solver Modules, Mesh Manipulation Modules, Hybrid RANS/LES turbulence models, GENIE++, TIGER, CAGI, GGTK, PMAG, MEGG3D, KPROP, KDEFORM, and KSTRUC.<br />An Ombudsman has been appointed to address the concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Manager or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting points of contact indentified below. The Ombudsman is Colonel Arnold Bunch, AAC/CV, at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin, AFB FL 32542-5495; his phone number is 850-882-5422.

<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Desktop Tape Prepacks by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0862 3/4 X 1000 inch Matte Tape Value Pack, 6 rolls per pack.</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0863 3/4 X 1000 inch Glossy Tape Value Pack, 6 rolls per pack.</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0864 3/4 X 1000 inch Matte Tape Value Pack, 10 rolls of tape per pack with <br />desktop tape dispenser</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the GSA, New York, NY.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Desktop Tape Prepacks to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0862 UNV-83410<br />SPR 60050<br />MMM-6200341000<br />MMM-810P10K<br />MMM-810K12<br />MMM-810K16<br />MMM-810K20<br />MMM-810K24<br />MMM-810-6PK</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0863 MMM-600K6<br />MMM-600K12<br />MMM-600-6PK</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0864 MMM-810P10K-DS<br />MMM-810C40BK<br />MMM-810K2-C28<br />SPR-64008<br />MMM-810K6C38</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Desktop Tape Prepacks to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 24, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Cepheid, 904 Caribbean Drive, Sunnyvale, Ca 94089 to provide one (1) Smart Cycler II 1 Block Laptop System (SC1600), ND, Part Number SC2500N4-1. 
The Applied Genetics Group in the Biochemical Science Division in the Chemical Sciences and Technology Laboratory at NIST is looking to develop rapid PCR protocols for forensic identifications. This instrument would be used in relation to a DNA biometrics project.  The amplification of genetics markers located throughout the human genome provides a unique means to identify individuals.  
     This instrument will aid in the rapid DNA typing of individuals with existing forensic DNA typing PCR kits. This instrument will also be used to develop rapid screening assays incorporating the optical real time PCR capabilities of the system.  
The instrument selected to perform this work needs to meet the following specifications:
 The ability to accept a specialized optically clear closed-tube format (with a volume of at least 25ul)
 The instrument must be capable of running 16 or more independent thermal cycling profiles simultaneously.
 The heating ramp rate of the cycler must be at least 8 degrees Celsius per second.
 The cooling ramp rate of the cycler must be at least 2 degrees Celsius per second.
 The instrument must be capable of simultaneous detection of 4 fluorescent dyes (4 channel detection)
 The excitation of the fluorescent dyes must be provided by light emitting diodes (LEDs) 
Cepheid is a proven instrument vendor that produces real time PCR instruments for a variety of forensic and pathogen detection applications.
We are not aware of any other instrument vendors that would be able to meet the above instrument specifications.  
 Product must meet all applicable 508 standards.
Based on NISTs recent market research NIST is not aware of any other vendors that can meet these minimum specifications.

The Government intends to solicit on this one source under the authority FAR 13.106-1(b). Interested concerns may identify their capabilities  to meet theses minimum requirements by submitting a capability statement that demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to provide the required license renewals. Capability statements may be emailed to Janice.Moten@nist.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procedure. This notice is not a request for quotation. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This notice is a follow-up to a Special Notice posted on FedBizOpps on November 25, 2008 entitled "Series of Tests for Evaluating the Effectiveness of "Extended Feature Sets" in latent Fingerprint Searches."

This is strictly a special notice that is being published so as to reach a wider audience. It is not a federal procurement action.  NO SOLICITATION IS OR WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS NOTICE.

Announcement of Scheduled Tests:

The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is pleased to announce the NIST Latent Fingerprint Workshop 2009, to be held on March 19 and 20 at NIST.  This workshop will present and discuss the results of the recently completed NIST Evaluation of Latent Fingerprint Technologies (ELFT) Phase II -- which evaluated the performance of "lights-out" encoding and matching of latent images.  This workshop will also provide a venue for the upcoming NIST Evaluation of Latent Fingerprint Technologies: Extended Feature Sets (ELFT-EFS).

Extended features means fingerprint image characteristics beyond those traditionally used by human experts and/or AFIS systems.  The goals are to quantify the performance achievable by supplementing traditional features with extended features" and thereby guide future standardization thereof.

The extended feature evaluation is sponsored by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  NIST will coordinate this project closely with the FBI.  Staff from NIST and Noblis, Inc. will administer the tests.  The CDEFFS document is available at: http://fingerprint.nist.gov/standard/cdeffs  

Who Should Participate:

Participants in ELFT-EFS should plan to attend the workshop.  Vendors of AFIS systems and academic institutions with a latent fingerprint search capability are strongly encouraged to participate in ELFT-EFS.

How to Participate:

Detailed information may be obtained from the following websites:

http://fingerprint.nist.gov/latent/elft-efs/index.html
http://fingerprint.nist.gov/latent/workshop09/index.html 

The above website contains a link for on-line registration.  The registration fee is $28.
This website will also contain a detailed workshop program.

Comments are welcomed from all sectors of the latent community.  NIST is particularly interested in timely feedback on participation in the workshop.

Communications should be addressed to: latent-efs@nist.gov

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard intends to procure two American National Standards Institute (ANSI) memberships.  (SEE NOTE 22) This proposed procurement is for services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis to the American National Standards Institute, 24 West 43rd Street  4th floor, New York, NY 10036-7406, (212)642-4926.

DESCRIPTION:   

ANSI is the coordinator of the U.S. voluntary standardization system and the premiere gateway to the international standards and conformity assessment arena.  Through its committees and working groups, the Institute facilitates the development of American standards and formulates the U.S. positions on issues before the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).  In addition, the Institute maintains close ties to other foreign standards bodies and key regional standards organizations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Americas and the Pacific-Rim.  As such, ANSI represents the Coast Guard in the domestic, regional and standards and community assessment arenas.  Additionally, ANSI facilitates the development of American National Standards (ANS) by accrediting the procedures of standards developing organizations (SDOs).  These groups work cooperatively to develop voluntary national consensus standards.  Accreditation by ANSI signifies that the procedures used by the standards body in connection with the development of American National Standards meet the Institutes essential requirements for openness, balance, consensus and due process.  Additional member benefits include a subscription to the ANSI Reporter which discusses topics of interest to the global standards and conformity assessment community; Standards Tracking and Automated Reporting (STAR); discounts on many standards collections, i.e., ISO, IEC, and ANS publications; eSubscriptions and Site Licensing Agreements; Education and Training Services; and Government Affairs and Public Policy Support.  
Note 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 	5000 W National Avenue, Bldg 5, Milwaukee WI  532952.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for emergency Medicar transportation services for the VA Hines Hospital.  Procurement will proceed on a sole source basis SCR Medical Transportation for a one month interim contract.3.	A description of supplies/services required (including the estimated value):  VA Hines Hospital has a requirement for Emergency 24 hour Medicar Transportation Services for transportation to and from North of Hwy 38 and Indiana/Michigan.   4.	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-2.  The VA's minimum needs are Unusual and Compelling Urgency based on the fact that the current transportation contract will expire on February 28, 2009 without further provisions to extend and the new contractor can not perform services until April 1, 2009.  It is for the betterment of patient care to procure transportation services from SCR Medical Transporation.  5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  The Contracting Officer had issued a solicitation for transportation services for VA Hines Hospital.  Proposals were received and evaluated.  The Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) recommended awarding the contract to a firm.  Services are currently being provided to Hines VA Hospital by that firm.  The Contract Review Board (CRB) concluded that there were deficiencies in both of the proposals that were evaluated by the SSEB and that the SSEB was not consistent in following the prescribed Source Selection Plan.  Although the written intent of the solicitation was to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions, due to proposal deficiencies, the CRB determined that discussion would be necessary.  However, in the course of the CRB meeting it was further determined that discussion and subsequent award would not meet VA's goals for transportation of veteran patients.  The final decision of the CRB was for the Contracting Officer to cancel the solicitation and during the interim; the following plan would be followed until a one year with two one-year options contract can be established:	Extend the current contract through February 28, 2009 to allow for emergency contracts to be awarded. 	Issue a RFQ to three known contractors due to urgent and compelling needs at VA Hines.  Past history and current performance indicators suggest that the transportation needs of VA Hines exceeds the capacity of a single provider.  By utilizing numerous contractors, it is the expectation that each of the contractors would be able to better utilize their resources in responding to scheduled daily trips.  The three emergency contracts will be issued by geographic areas:o	North of Highway 38o	South of Highway 38o	Indiana/Michigan	Establish competitive BPA with a minimum of four (4) small businesses to handle all unscheduled or add-on trips.  The current contractor provides approximately 3,000 trips per month.  The trips are scheduled 24 hours in advance.  When additional trips are added to the schedule it results in delays.  The BPA providers will only be used for transport of patients who were not scheduled 24 hours in advance.  This will eliminate waiting times for patients.Page 2The emergency contracts and BPA will be awarded for six months which is the estimated time for the Contracting Officer to award a new contract.  A solicitation was issued to procure the services of a Transportation Consultant.  These services will include:	Evaluate current contractor provided Patient Transportation Services Program	Evaluate implementation and monitoring of the resulting contract	Develop Statement of Work of the resulting contract	Develop performance monitors and standards	Develop Standard Operating Procedures	Baseline, bi-weekly, final written assessments	Quarterly reports	Site visits  The need for this emergency purchase order is essential in order to prevent service interruption.6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  There are currently three (3) firms who responded to a recent solicitation to provide transportation services for VA Hines Hospital.  SCR will be issued an emergency purchase order for one month until the 6-month contract commences on April 1, 2009.7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  The cost of the services is anticipated to be similar to the proposed unit costs of the offeror whose price proposal was evaluated and determined to be fair and reasonable.  8.	Market survey conducted:  An internet search was completed.9.	Other facts:  None10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  None11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  None12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.PATRICE R.

<DESC><p>The Contractor shall furnish all labor and materials to harvest selected pine trees from 8 areas totaling 48.49 acres. Six areas totaling 7.48 acres will be selectively thinned. Two areas totaling 41.01 acres will be clearcut. Volumes are estimated to be approximately 3,200 tons of pine pulpwood and 300 tons of fuelwood chips. The timber consists of well-stocked loblolly pine plantations and is considered to be of fair quality for the Sumter Area. The Contractor shall have completed harvesting operations and removed all designated timber from the sites by 1 May 2009.&nbsp; The areas to be harvested are located at Shaw Air Force Base, Sumter County, South Carolina. The Base is located on the north side of U.S. Highway 378 between Sumter, SC, and Columbia, SC. The specific locations of the sale areas are shown on the Timber Sale Location Map which is incorporated as part of this contract. Within five of the areas to be thinned, all trees are to be harvested except those marked with multiple spots of blue paint at eye level. Within the other thinning area, only trees marked with orange paint are to be removed. Within the two clearcut areas, all trees are to be cut. Bidders are expected to satisfy themselves as to the conditions that may affect the cost of performance under this contract. It is considered impractical to determine by other means the exact nature of work, site conditions under which work is to be performed, product break down and total quantity to be harvested. The submission of a bid will be considered as certification that the site has been inspected and the nature of work and the effects of existing and/or adjacent work have been determined. Inspection of the sites will be conducted Thursday, 12 March 2009 at 10:00 A.M. by arrangements with Lt John Dix the contracting representative, telephone 803-895-5264, FAX 803-895-5339, email: john.dix@shaw.af.mil or alternate Mr. Ronald Alexander at 803-895-5392, email ronald.alexander@shaw.af.mil.

Delete paragraph(m) in its entirety and substitute the following: (m) Termination for Cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If this contract is terminated in whole or in part for cause, and the supplies or services covered by the contract so terminated are repurchased

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">This is a combined commercial synopsis/solicitation, (HSFEEM-09-Q-0018) supplemented with additional information included herein (SOW Attached). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation for quotes, as a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/FEMA has a requirement for hotel/motel rooms for up to a total of 128 "room nights" for participants attending the FY 2009 Homeland Security Preparedness Technical Assistance Program (HSPTAP)/Enhancing Grants Management Technical Assistance Program Workshop in Atlanta, GA. DHS/FEMA has scheduled the conference for April 28-29, 2009. The Government procures lodging to insure the availability of rooms for a large number of people at the same location in order to receive at a minimum, the Government rate in accordance with the GSA Federal Travel Regulations. The hotel/motel shall be in compliance with the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. The hotel/motel must be capable of offering facilities accommodating up to approximately 60 attendees considering guest rooms and all other business associated conference facilities (See Attached SOW/Details). The hotel/motel shall honor any standard cancellation policy regarding any cancellations, and any billing policy for no-shows, meaning that no-shows will be billed for the date that would have been the date of check-in only. Participants will call the hotel/motel at least 21 days prior to the conference date to reserve their room. Callers will identify themselves as participants (attendees) in the "FY 2009 FEMA EGMTA Workshop," and give the hotel/motel the dates for which they will require lodging. Conference attendees will make their reservations by individual call in; rooms will be reserved on each caller's personal credit card. If the hotel/motel is contacted by a Federal Government employee, the caller will be required to pay for their lodging using their personal Federal Government Travel Card. The "Grand Total" quoted price shall represent the total cost for the entire period for which the conference will be held. The "Grand Total" is a Not-To-Exceed price - whereby the hotel/motel shall only invoice the Government for, and the Government shall only pay for, conference facilities/space and audio-visual costs if separately quoted cost items, and the actual number of guest rooms not occupied and paid for by anticipated conference attendees during the period of the conference in accordance with the hotel's standard contract terms and conditions. The quote for blocking the number of guests rooms should be structured in a format that indicates if the break/snack costs are included as part of the quoted room costs, whether or not the conference facilities/space are included as part of the package covering the cost of the guest rooms to be blocked, or if this will be a separate charge in accordance with the offeror's standard contract terms and conditions. Additionally, offerors must clearly indicate the cost of the audio-visual requirements if not included as part of the conference facilities/space. If the break/snack cost, the conference facilities/space and the cost of the audio-visual are not provided as an integral part of the cost of guest rooms to be blocked in accordance with the hotels standard contract, the price of the conference facilities and audio-visual requirements must be clearly listed as separate cost items. If the break/snack costs are not or cannot be included in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations guest room cost, please clearly indicate this cannot be done as the break/snack requirement and cost will then be deleted in its' entirety from the resulting order. Offerors should also provide a copy of their standard contract listing all terms and conditions upon which the quote is based. A purchase order in the amount sufficient to cover all quoted costs will be issued to the lowest cost offeror representing the best value to the Government. Upon conclusion of the conference and final determination of final costs such as costs expected to be but not covered by the attendees, conference facilities/space, and costs associated with audio-visual requirements if not included with package quote, will be covered under the commercial purchase order to be issued by the Government in accordance with the hotel's standard contract terms and conditions. Upon final determination and payment of all pending charges payable by the Government in order to satisfy the terms of the hotel's accepted contract, all remaining funding on the purchase order will be de-obligated. The per night lodging cost shall not exceed the cost listed in the Federal Travel Regulations. Additionally, in order to insure competitiveness, additional discounts are encouraged. It is requested that the Federal Government be granted a general tax exemption for all rooms to be paid for by the Federal Government. Quotes shall be inclusive of the per-night cost per room, a sub-total cost indicating the cost for each of the night periods separately, and a Grand Total for the entire period. In order to be considered for award, the offer must be determined to be technically acceptable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Award will be made to the offeror who is technically acceptable with the lowest price.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To be determined technically acceptable, the offeror's quotation will be subjected to the following "Go/No Go" criteria:<br /><br />(1) The offeror must demonstrate ability to provide the requested number of guest rooms/nights and associated conference facilities as described in the SOW on the dates indicated, (2) be within 25 miles of the Atlanta, GA airport, and (3) The offeror must be in compliance with the Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act. </span></p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items/services.  Offers are hereby requested and further written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is a total small business set-aside.  Offers received from other than small business concerns will not be considered.  

The requirement is to furnish all labor, equipment, materials, supplies, transportation, supervision and incidentals necessary to conduct an exploration, marking and inventory of field tiles within three areas of the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, Wilmington IL, totaling an estimated 367 acres.  

Interested parties must submit any questions regarding the solicitation, in writing, to the Contracting Officer listed below.  

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541360; the Size Standard is $4.5M.  
A size standard is the largest that a concern can be and still qualify as a small business for Federal Government programs. For the most part, size standards are the average annual receipts or the average employment of a firm. How to calculate average annual receipts and average employment of a firm can be found in 13 CFR  121.104 and 13 CFR  121.106, respectively. SBA also includes the table of size standards in the Small Business Size Regulations, 13 CFR 121.201. This table includes size standards that have changed since the last publication of 13 CFR 121. For more information on these size standards, please visit http://www.sba.gov/size. If you have any other questions concerning size standards, contact a Size Specialist at your nearest SBA Government Contracting Area Office, or contact the Office of Size Standards by email at sizestandards@sba.gov or by phone at (202) 205-6618.
Status as a qualified HUBZone small business concern is determined by the Small Business Administration (SBA) in accordance with 13 CFR Part 126. If the SBA determines that a concern is a qualified HUBZone small business concern, it will issue a certification to that effect and will add the concern to the List of Qualified HUBZone Small Business Concerns on its Internet website at http://www.sba.gov/hubzone. A firm on the list is eligible for HUBZone program preferences without regard to the place of performance. The concern must appear on the list to be a HUBZone small business concern.
If the offeror does not have a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. An offeror within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.
A prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. Registration requires a DUNS number. If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.
Potential offerors may complete the annual representations and certificates electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov; a DUNS number is needed to initiate this process.

PART I - PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS) FOR MEDICAL STANDARDS PROGRAM NPS
1.0	Introduction
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) requires that agencies establish medical and physical qualifications for individuals entering and retaining positions that primarily perform arduous duties.  To fulfill this requirement, the National Park Service (NPS) developed a Medical Standards Program (MSP).    
Under this program, the NPS applies these medical qualifications to all positions in which arduous duties are assigned, whether as a primary or collateral duty, and whether the position is career, term, or temporary.  
The program's objective is to determine if the applicant or employee has any medical condition(s) that would prevent them from performing, with or without reasonable accommodation, the essential functions of the position without posing a significant risk to the safety and health of themselves or others. It must be determined if the examinee's health status, or if applicable, medical condition(s), will be aggravated and/or worsened by the physical demands and/or working conditions of the job or work conditions.    Currently, the arduous duty occupations included in the program are: law enforcement, scuba divers and structural firefighters.  The number of examinations needed in the first year is estimated to be approximately 600.  Depending on the number of new hires, policy changes, and/or additions or subtractions in personnel types to the program, this figure could dramatically increase or decrease in subsequent years.
The program is managed by the Risk Management Division under the Visitor and Resource Protection Associateship at NPS Headquarters in Washington, DC.  Within the division there is a Medical Standards Program Manager (MSPM) and a staff.  These personnel oversee the program at the National Level which is dispersed across all of the United States, although some individual's work and reside in remote areas.  
The period of performance for the services to be performed nation- wide is for one (1) year with four (4) one-year option periods (if exercised).
2.0	DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES
The Contractor shall provide a comprehensive occupational medical examination program for applicants and employees. The general medical and occupational history review and general physical examinations provide the basis for the medical determination/status of applicants and employees to perform the essential functions of arduous duty positions and disclose any health issues that may prevent the effective performance of official duties.  The contractor shall provide all necessary facilities, staff, materials and equipment to administer an all inclusive medical examination program as delineated in the performance tasks outlined in Section 2 of this PWS.  2.1	Appointment/Examination SchedulingSchedule, oversee, and document all exams required to make the final medical rating determination.  Examinations will be requested by NPS designated personnel via the web-based application delineated in Section 2.2.  Provide examinees with the medical packet and schedule their exams.  Scheduled exams must be conducted within a 50 mile radius of the examinee's home or office of record.  Exam types and requirements are provided in Section 4, Definitions of Exam Types and Requirements of this PWS.  2.1.1	Medical ExamsConduct all required exams in one day unless prior approval is received from the Medical Standards Program Manager (MSPM).  An exception is granted for the PPD (TB skin test).  All personnel performing medical exams must understand the medical standards required for arduous duty.  Clinical errors which result in retesting shall be performed at no charge.2.1.2	Medical DeterminationReview the results of all required medical exams necessary to make an initial medical rating qualification determination consistent with the National Park Service (NPS) medical qualification standards. This review and determination is conducted by the contractor's Board Certified Internist or Occupational Health Physician who will be referred to as the Medical Review Officer (MRO) throughout this PWS.  If additional detailed medical information is needed for the MRO to make a final determination of 'medically qualified' or 'not medically qualified', coordinate with the examinee to acquire this information. If all applicable medical information is obtained from the examinee's personal physician and medical clearance is still not warranted (i.e. not medically qualified), the examinee may continue to submit more information, but 90 days (from the initial appointment date) the contractor must make a final determination of 'medically qualified' or 'not medically qualified' with the available information at that time.  Additional information may continue to be submitted by the examinee at any time, which may overturn the final determination.  The review of any additional information, as well as any MRO consulting, is considered part of the examination.  If the final determination is one of 'not medically qualified', notify and forward, as requested by the Program Manager, copies of all medical information.  Document the final determination, including a written summary of exam findings and any examinee personal health care provider diagnosis/prognosis/treatment recommendations, in the secure web-based application delineated in Section 2.2            2.2	Data Management
Provide a secure web-based application, hosting infrastructure and services for requesting, scheduling, tracking and documenting all data associated with the Medical Standards Program accessible only by authorized users.  Develop and implement website training.  Train end-users on the secure website through on-line training or scheduled classes as requested by the MSPM.  Establish user accounts when requested by the MSPM.  Transition all existing examinee determination data (i.e. dates and times of all previous determinations, name, SSN, park unit of examinees, etc.) from the excel spreadsheet application to the application, and transition all existing examinee scanned medical history forms to the application in order to ensure all historical data is maintained and available for use in the new application.  The application will be used for executing and documenting all facets of the Medical Standards Program and will meet the following functional requirements:(a). Automate the exam requesting and scheduling process(b). Document attempts made by the contractor to contact/schedule the exams with examinee(c). Real-time tracking of the status and progress of examinee's examination processes (d). Document individual examination results(e). Document the final determination of the MRO(f). Incorporate and maintain individual examinee files that contain all historical and current examinations and personal identification information, including:name, social security number, date of birth, address (work or home), date of all NPS examination(s), age, month and year of next examination, exam category (Baseline /Periodic/Exit), status of all past and ongoing examination(s) during contract period, copies of documentation of any current or previous waivers, and event log of all past and ongoing examination(s).(g). Document the entire evaluation for a historical basis  (h). Provide exam reports and final determination documentation compatible with MS Office or Adobe Acrobat(i). Provide access to digital examinee medical records(j). Provide role based access to examinee information(k). Provide for NPS generated queries(l). Provide internal secure messaging(m).

Maintain copies of all previous and current NPS medical files for all examinees.  Convert all paper documentation that is generated during the current contract to electronic media for posting to the secure web application in Section 2.2
2.4	Customer SupportProvide, implement, operate and maintain a fully-functional Call Center, including a 1-800 fax line, for recording, triaging, troubleshooting and resolving/ redirecting customer support requirements and ensuring minimum user downtime.  Communicate to employees their personal health issues/concerns that do not affect clearance for arduous duty (e.g. elevated triglycerides) that are found on any of the examinations.  Provide hardcopy results to examinee upon completion of determination.
2.5	Medical Consultations	Provide medical consultations to the NPS when requested by the MSPM, and to a Waiver Team Meeting or a Medical Review Board (MRB) when requested by the MSPM or the MRB Chair.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SHRP 2 Request for Proposals</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Renewal<br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> R01-C <br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Innovations to Expand the Locatable Zone For Underground Utilities <br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> March 10, 2009<br /><br /><strong>SHRP 2 Background</strong></p>
<p>To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); congestion reduction through improved travel time reliability (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with a total program duration of seven years. <br /><br /><strong>Renewal Focus Area</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. highway system is aging and must be rebuilt while we are driving on it and living next to it. Research in the SHRP 2 Renewal focus area therefore addresses the need to develop a consistent, systematic approach to completing highway projects quickly, with minimal disruption to the community, and producing facilities that are long-lasting. Identifying new technologies for locating underground utilities; developing procedures to speed the evaluation of designs and the inspection of construction; and applying new methods and materials for preserving, rehabilitating, and reconstructing roadways and bridges are among the goals for this focus area. Alternative strategies for contracting, financing and managing projects, and mitigating institutional barriers also are part of the emphasis on rapid renewal. The renewal scope applies to all classes of roads.</p>
<p><strong>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>Utilities that exist beyond the zone where surface-based methods can locate them present a particularly difficult problem. Utilities are increasingly placed deeper as the near-surface space becomes crowded, and utility construction techniques become more capable. Existing surface-based methods for utility detection become less effective as depths increase. The European Street Works Research Advisory Council (ESWRAC) identified surface-based and below-ground survey techniques as promising areas of innovation. The <em>Mapping The Underworld</em> (MTU) project in the United Kingdom is also evaluating innovative technologies. Project R01-C investigates innovations for locating utilities not detectable by methods being evaluated in project R01-B.</p>
<p><strong>Project Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The primary objective of this project is to improve the detection and accurate determination of the positions of buried utilities within an expanded locatable zone up to Quality Level B as defined by CI/ASCE 38-02, the Standard Guidelines for the Collection and Depiction of Existing Subsurface Utility Data, using any appropriate methods without duplicating the scope of project R01-B. This objective may be accomplished by combining existing methods or developing new technologies. This project will also develop guidance that transportation agencies may use to include the developed innovative methods into their "Utility Accommodation Manual" and also can assist utility owners by expanding the locatable zone and improving detectability of future utility installations.</p>
<p>The innovations to be examined should include, but not be limited to, alternative or novel surface-based approaches, in-line survey or signal emitters deployed from inside an existing utility, and modifications to existing tools.<br /><br /><strong>Tasks </strong></p>
<p><em>Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objectives. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach for meeting the research objectives.</em></p>
<p><em>Phase I</em></p>
<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> <strong>Review of Current and Emerging Practices</strong></p>
<p>Conduct a review of the performance and limitations of current and emerging practices and technologies. This review shall include nondestructive methods used in other industries (both foreign and domestic). It will also include a quantitative assessment of the dimensional range of locatable zones, including trade-offs among distance, resolution, precision, and operational/equipment costs for various site and ground conditions, nearby utilities, and utility types, materials, and sizes.</p>
<p>The review must include current and evolving utility tagging/tracing practices. The factors to be considered for utility tagging/tracing practices include: maximum burial depth of the device, proposed system for long-term use/replacement of device/tracer, energy provision for active devices, data storage and update capabilities, data security, anticipated cost of the tags/tracers in commercial production, environmental restrictions, and method of attachment/association with the pipe or utility. Examples of tagging/tracing practices are transponders, RFID, locatable plastic pipes, and trace wires.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2: Plan for Innovations to Improve Extent of Locatable Zone</strong></p>
<p>Synthesize the findings of Task 1 and identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement of existing and development of new technologies. Prepare a detailed plan of the proposed innovative device(s)/process(es)/method(s) containing the desired performance capabilities, testing procedures, field testing program (data acquisition, processing, and analysis), and development and evaluation milestones. The plan should document the rationale behind the ranking of the proposed innovation(s) and describe quantitatively the activities required to evaluate each innovation. Cycles of innovation refinement and testing should also be identified.</p>
<p>This plan should include relevant information from other underground utility mapping research projects, and how this project will be coordinated with SHRP 2 projects R01-A and R01-B.</p>
<p><strong>Task 3: Phase I Report</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a Phase I report that documents the results of Task 1 Review and Task 2 Plan. The Phase I report shall also include a detailed test plan for the laboratory and field testing to be undertaken in Task 5. This report will be due within five (5) months of the contract award.</p>
<p>Acceptance and approval of the Phase I report along with the selection of the innovation(s) to be further evaluated is a requirement before proceeding to Phase II.</p>
<p><em>Phase II -</em> <strong>Innovation Development and Field Evaluation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Task 4: Innovation Prototype</strong></p>
<p>Develop a prototype suitable for proof-of-concept testing. This task will include development and controlled testing of the detection capabilities of the selected innovation(s). As part of the development and test process, the raw signals emitted from and received by the prototype must be recorded and provided in addition to the results after signal processing and interpretation. Depending on the type(s) of selected innovation(s), physical demonstration of the system capabilities may be appropriate. It is desirable for innovation(s) to share similar operating characteristics with common commercial system in terms of size and power of key components. Develop a users' manual for the prototype.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5: Testing </strong></p>
<p>Conduct proof-of-concept testing in the laboratory and field. This task will compile data on the detection effectiveness of the innovation(s), the time for deployment, associated equipment, operational and equipment costs, interpretation effort, etc. Precision and accuracy of the innovation(s) shall be quantified and compared to the desired performance capabilities defined in Task 2. Testing and refinement cycles of the innovation(s) are strongly encouraged. Update the users' manual as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Task 6: Guidance for Transportation Agencies/Utility Owners</strong></p>
<p>Guidance shall be developed that is suitable for use by transportation agencies to incorporate the use of the developed innovative methods into their "Utility Accommodation Manual" and by utility owners for expanding the locatable zone and improving the detectability of future installations, including the marking of existing utilities when exposed. This guidance document shall be submitted as a succinct section of the final project report. It will be in a form suitable for future distribution as an independent standalone report.</p>
<p><strong>Task 7: Final report </strong></p>
<p>Prepare a Final report. The final report should include results from Tasks 1-6. Recommendations regarding further development/refinements of the innovation(s) will be included along with the updated prototype users' manual.</p>
<p><strong>Deliverables </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Phase 1 Report documenting Tasks 1 and 2.<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Final Report documenting Tasks 1 through 6.<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Quarterly progress reports.<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Two (2) interim meetings with SHRP 2 staff: One (1) in Washington, DC and one (1) at the contractor's facility or field test site.<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;One (1) meeting with the project Technical Expert Task Group (T-ETG) and SHRP 2 staff for Phase I Report Review and Innovation Selection.<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Telephone conference calls, as needed.<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;One (1) interim meeting with the Technical Coordinating Committee in Washington DC; Irvine, CA; or Woods Hole, MA.</p>

<p><strong>Special Note 1:</strong> This project is based, in part, on recommendations developed in a previous SHRP 2 Renewal project, R01 "Encouraging Innovation in Locating and Characterizing Underground Utilities." A PDF file containing the R01 contractor's draft final report is available on request. This project is one of three that build on Project R01 that address underground utility location and characterization. The others are <em>R01-A, Technologies to Support Storage, Retrieval, and Utilization of 3-D Utility Location Data</em>, and <em>R01-B, Multisensor Platforms for Locating Underground Utilities</em>. The research team for this project will be expected to coordinate regularly with the teams working on these other projects.</p>
<p><strong>General </strong><br />1. Proposals will be evaluated by SHRP 2 staff and Expert Task Groups (ETGs) consisting of individuals collectively very knowledgeable in the problem area. Selection of an agency is made by the SHRP 2 Oversight Committee, based on the recommendation from SHRP 2 staff and the ETG. The following factors are considered: (1) the proposer's demonstrated understanding of the problem; (2) the merit of the proposed research approach and experimental design; (3) the experience, qualifications, and objectivity of the research team in the same or closely related problem area; (4) the proposer's plan for participation by disadvantaged business enterprises (DBEs)-small firms owned and controlled by minorities or women; and (5) the adequacy of facilities.</p>
<p>TRB and the SHRP 2 Oversight Committee strongly encourage the significant participation of DBEs in SHRP 2 research contracts. Although no quota is specified nor is DBE participation mandated, the proposer's plan for involvement of DBEs is a factor in contractor selection, and the contractor's adherence to its DBE plan will be monitored during the contract period. Contractors are required to submit periodic reports comparing actual with proposed payments to DBEs. The Contractor Expression of Interest section of the SHRP 2 website is a resource for proposers interested in participating on research teams. This database is being enhanced and will be renamed the Research Team Builder.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SHRP 2 Request for Proposals</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Renewal<br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> R01-A <br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Innovation in Technologies to Support the Storage, Retrieval, and Utilization of 3-D Utility Location Data in Highway Renewal<br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> March 10, 2009<br /><br /><strong>SHRP 2 Background</strong></p>
<p>To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); congestion reduction through improved travel time reliability (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with total program duration of 7 years. <br /><br /><strong>Renewal Focus Area</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. highway system is aging and must be rebuilt while we are driving on it and living next to it. Research in the SHRP 2 Renewal focus area therefore addresses the need to develop a consistent, systematic approach to completing highway projects quickly, with minimal disruption to the community, and producing facilities that are long-lasting. Identifying new technologies for locating underground utilities; developing procedures to speed the evaluation of designs and the inspection of construction; and applying new methods and materials for preserving, rehabilitating, and reconstructing roadways and bridges are among the goals for this focus area. Alternative strategies for contracting, financing, and managing projects and mitigating institutional barriers also are part of the emphasis on rapid renewal. The renewal scope applies to all classes of roads.</p>
<p><strong>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>It is commonly held among transportation officials that the accurate location and characterization of utilities (both above and below ground) and other similar facilities, especially deeply-buried ones, and their timely protection or relocation is a major factor in preventing delays in highway renewal projects. Such delays can extend the period of project development and impede construction delivery as documented in the final report for SHRP 2 Project R01, "Encouraging Innovation in Locating and Characterizing Underground Utilities." Inaccurate location of utilities contributes to traffic and community disruption when service lines are encountered unexpectedly or access by utility repair crews is blocked by construction activities. Inadvertent damage to underground utilities can lead to environmental damage or even put the health and safety of construction workers and the public at risk.</p>
<p>Because utilities often are co-located on highway rights of way, renewal projects are vulnerable to utility-related delay and disruption. It is important to develop accurate plans that fully consider utilities and, by knowing this information early in the project development process, develop effective and cost-efficient strategies to protect or relocate the utility or provide alternative service to utility customers if service must be interrupted temporarily. Currently, many underground utilities are difficult to locate and characterize and often impede progress of transportation projects. Utilities can become "lost" as construction alters the landscape and pre-existing benchmarks are removed. In the worst cases, no information exists until the utility is encountered during construction. These situations often result in significant delays to construction because work is suspended while utilities are relocated or the facility is redesigned. Unplanned service interruptions have even wider impact on communities served by the utility. The importance of this topic has led to an increased focus by project and utility owners in recent years as the current capabilities are taxed by renewal projects of increasing complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Project Objective</strong></p>
<p>This project is intended to identify best practices for modeling, structuring, storing, retrieving, visualizing, and integrating 3-D utility data and to develop an innovative approach that leverages recent advances in technologies including, but not limited to, global positioning systems (GPS), ground penetrating radar, and geographical information systems (GIS). These practices would improve the quality and efficiency of storing, retrieving, and utilizing utility records include active and passive detection equipment, with three-dimensional positional and structural information. The project is also intended to demonstrate the collection, management, and use of such information in a multi-utility environment. The overall objective is to reduce the time spent on repeatedly "refinding" known utilities so that resources can be focused on unknown or previously mis-recorded utilities and so that an increasingly comprehensive record of utility information beneath public rights-of-way can be created.</p>
<p><strong>Project Scope</strong></p>
<p>The project is intended to develop alternative strategies for acquiring 3-D utility location data and implement a pilot project within a defined geographic area including a number of participating utilities. The project will provide a demonstration of the access control, data security, data pedigree (based on the Standard Guidelines for the Collection and Depiction of Existing Subsurface Utility Data CI/ASCE 38-02), positioning uncertainty, available characterization data, and liability issues that would be faced in a full-scale implementation of the system. On-going database management issues, data ownership, and data sharing shall be discussed. Providing documented examples of solutions to these administrative and legal issues is an important part of the project. The project should include implementation of positional and structural data capture involving the participating agency and the participating utilities for new utility installations and exposure of existing utilities, and the removal or updating of the status of those utilities that may have undergone relocation. The project shall include the pilot implementation of computerized utilities' data, maps, and models. This implementation will be used in utility locating and characterization for design purposes, and for damage prevention in excavation or construction projects. Existing laws and best practices regarding utility damage prevention should be followed. The advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approaches should be recorded.</p>
<p>The proposer may include one or more technology providers; a transportation, municipal, or other public works agency with the responsibility for permitting and construction within utility corridors or public rights-of-way; and at least two independent utilities that have agreed to participate in the demonstration project.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the proposer may have existing software and/or hardware either in commercial use, prototype development, or in the research stage. The proposal should disclose how the proposed approach will improve on the current status of the technology development and implementation. Proposers are encouraged to provide data to show the current capabilities of the proposer's technology, including horizontal and vertical positional accuracy and any improvements in data modeling and management. Information about the prior use of such technologies in connection with projects should be verified by a client or consultant who is not financially connected to the technology development. It is important that sufficient technical information be provided in the proposal to allow the technical reviewers to assess the likelihood of significant advances over current technology. The proposers should also demonstrate familiarity with existing national and international approaches to this problem (e.g., the U.K. VISTA/Mapping the Underworld (MTU) initiative, the Virginia pilot study of GPS-based One-Call ticketing and other commercial developments in the public domain).</p>
<p>The proposal must include plans for coordination with SHRP 2 projects R01-B and R01-C.</p>
<p><strong>Project Tasks </strong></p>
<p><em>Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objectives. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach for meeting the research objectives.</em></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><strong>SHRP 2 Request for Proposals</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Renewal<br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> R01-B <br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Utility Locating Technology Development Utilizing Multi-Sensor Platforms<br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> March 10, 2009<br /><br /><strong>SHRP 2 Background</strong></p>
<p>To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); congestion reduction through improved travel time reliability (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with a total program duration of 7 years. <br /><br /><strong>Renewal Focus Area</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. highway system is aging and must be rebuilt while we are driving on it and living next to it. Research in the SHRP 2 Renewal focus area therefore addresses the need to develop a consistent, systematic approach to completing highway projects quickly, with minimal disruption to the community, and producing facilities that are long-lasting. Identifying new technologies for locating underground utilities; developing procedures to speed the evaluation of designs and the inspection of construction; and applying new methods and materials for preserving, rehabilitating, and reconstructing roadways and bridges are among the goals for this focus area. Alternative strategies for contracting, financing, and managing projects and mitigating institutional barriers also are part of the emphasis on rapid renewal. The renewal scope applies to all classes of roads.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>Deployment of multiple sensing techniques is currently necessary in many instances in order to image the various utilities of differing materials, sizes, depths, conductivity, ground conditions, surface obstacles, etc. Covering the same ground more than once with different instruments or techniques is inefficient if one pass with multiple sensing devices will suffice. Time constraints, cost of equipment, understanding of equipment capabilities, and operator training may be factors that discourage necessary multiple passes with different devices. Enhanced utility detection and characterization may be gained through a single pass with a multi-sensor platform due to simultaneous signal processing and data fusion. Combined with improved coupling techniques, a multi-sensor platform may lead to enhanced, perhaps automated, interpretation (better quality, lower risk) and better efficiency (less disruption and cost). The goal of this research is not to just place two or more existing separate devices on a single platform, but to improve the detection ability and efficiency, and/or lower equipment and training costs with improved hardware systems and software packages.</p>
<p><strong>Project Objective</strong></p>
<p>This project will support improvements in the detection and accurate determination of positions of buried utilities beyond Quality Level B as defined by CI/ASCE 38-02, the Standard Guidelines for the Collection and Depiction of Existing Subsurface Utility Data. The proposed combinations of new and/or existing sensor technologies and analysis software must offer significant advances in terms of utility detection and position (horizontal and vertical) from the ground surface across a wide range of soil types and site conditions. Enhanced utility detection is the primary objective. The technology will be validated by field tests of a multi-sensor platform that supports near- real- time utility detection and location. This multi-sensor platform must utilize at least two different geophysical methods and also be able to detect and assess existing electronic marker and transponder signals. Incorporation of methods that leverage the presence of known utilities to improve detection performance is encouraged.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks </strong></p>
<p><em>Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objectives. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach for meeting the research objectives.</em></p>
<p><em>Phase I-</em> <strong>Proof of Concept</strong></p>
<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> Prepare a detailed technology development plan across all project phases with schedule and milestones detailing hardware and software development and evaluation. This plan should review available sensors and define sensor combinations and data fusion processes to overcome limitations imposed by site conditions or utility material types and sizes. The plan will then define multi-sensor platform components and plans for prototype platform development and field verification. More than a single multi-sensor platform may be proposed to evaluate the entire range of site conditions and utility material types and sizes, if a single "universal" platform is determined to be impractical. The plan should document the rationale behind the one or more recommended platforms and methods and amplify activities presented in the proposal. Precision and bias for utility position and Type I and II errors for utility detection should be described. The plan should include relevant information from other underground utility mapping research projects, and must coordinate with SHRP 2 projects R01-A and R01-C. This Task 1 technology development plan will be due within three (3) months of the contract award. It will be submitted as part of the first Quarterly Progress Report and will be reviewed promptly by SHRP 2 staff and expert group members; approval with recommendations will be provided within two (2) weeks of plan submission.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> Develop a working proof-of-concept of the multi-sensor platform(s) recommended and defined in Task 1 that can be used in laboratory and controlled field trials (this is not intended to be a market-ready design). The research team will take into consideration the size and complexity of the sensor platform(s), and thus probable acceptance by end users. The approximate dimensions of conceptual sensor platform(s), anticipated means of deployment (e.g., hand-carried, push cart, or powered cart), and proposed spatial referencing system under common field conditions (e.g., open sky and beneath overpasses) shall be addressed during the development of the proof-of-concept prototype(s). Platforms can have any combination of passive detection or active signal generation devices. The proof-of-concept must address data fusion capabilities as well. If it becomes necessary to specify more than a single multi-sensor platform in order to meet the above criteria and yet be applicable to the variety of environmental and ground conditions, and utility material types and sizes, then the specifications of each platform, and the range of application conditions that the platform is expected to evaluate, must be defined. Significant advances over current technology should be described, along with precision and bias for utility position and Type I and II errors for utility detection that are expected to be achieved by the prototype(s).</p>
<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Demonstrate the prototype(s) with selected site testing of the detection capabilities of the platform(s) developed under Task 2. The tests should be designed to confirm the ability of the prototype enhancements to overcome limitations imposed by site conditions and utility material types and sizes to a maximum depth of 12 feet, and compare the results with the capabilities and limitations of current technology. As part of the test process, the raw signals received from the sensors must be recorded and provided, in addition to the results developed after signal processing, analysis, and interpretation. The results from this task will be used to refine the sensor systems that become the platform(s) that will be evaluated further in Phase II.</p>
<p><strong>Task 4:</strong> Prepare a Phase I report that documents the results of Tasks1-3, includes a field test plan for Task 6, and a plan for independent testing for Task 7. The field test plan should include details regarding at least five test locations where utility locations have been recently documented to Quality Level B and some points of the utilities to Quality Level A as defined by CI/ASCE 38-02.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SHRP 2 Request for Proposals</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Renewal<br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> R03<br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Identifying and Reducing Worker, Inspector, and Manager Fatigue in Rapid Renewal Environments<br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> March 10, 2009</p>
<p><br /><strong>SHRP 2 Background</strong></p>
<p>To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); improved travel time reliability through congestion reduction (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with total program duration of 7 years. Additional information about SHRP 2 can be found on the program's Web site at <a href="http://www.trb.org/shrp2">www.trb.org/shrp2</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Renewal Focus Area Background</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. highway system is aging and must be rebuilt while we are driving on it and living next to it. Research in the SHRP 2 Renewal focus area therefore addresses the need to complete highway projects quickly, with minimal disruption to the community, and to produce facilities that are long-lasting. Identifying new technologies for locating underground utilities; developing procedures to speed the evaluation of designs and the inspection of construction; and applying new methods and materials for preserving, rehabilitating, and reconstructing roadways and bridges are among the goals for this focus area. Alternative strategies for contracting, financing, and managing projects and mitigating institutional barriers also are part of the emphasis on rapid renewal.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>The impact of fatigue on the quality of work and the safety of workers, inspectors, and managers, especially on rapid renewal highway projects, is considered serious and in need of further investigation and solutions. "We put our best people on the most difficult projects and work them long and hard in difficult situations at night and on weekends. And when they do a good job, we reward them with more of the same" (Graff, 2002).</p>
<p>Worker, inspector, and manager fatigue on rapid renewal projects could eventually contribute to more on-site accidents, lower overall productivity rates, and lower quality of work. This in turn could lead to lower morale and less teamwork. Ultimately, fatigue could lead to higher costs to the construction work, delays, stress related health issues, family life issues, and higher employee turnover rates. The compressed schedules that may be associated with rapid renewal projects may also have an effect on the fatigue of design professionals as well. This project will investigate fatigue as it relates to rapid renewal projects, providing an overview of sleep, fatigue, and alertness and how they impact performance, teamwork, quality, and the potential for accidents and injury. The project will then discuss ways to mitigate fatigue by identifying safe limits for workers and supervisors.</p>
<p>The project will also identify different rapid renewal scenarios (night work, continuous extended hours, monthly, and yearly) and how the effects of fatigue may be minimized within each of them. The researcher will prepare reduced-fatigue work-hour scenarios and relate the scenarios to the size of the workforce needed. The researcher will also identify bidding strategies for rapid renewal projects that support reducing worker fatigue and allow additional flexibility to the contractor while not compromising overall project cost, quality, or schedule. All of these will be put into the context of an overall fatigue management program document.</p>
<p>The project will identify and evaluate a range of techniques that could be used by owners, constructors, and consultants to help educate and condition the workforce about fatigue issues, to improve alertness, and to identify ways that fatigue can be mitigated during work time and between work shifts. While ample information on fatigue and its impact on safety and teamwork are available in non-highway environments, this information is not well documented in the highway construction environment.</p>
<p>There appear to be three discrete responses to fatigue issues on a rapid renewal project:</p>
<p>1. Individual workers, inspectors, and managers need to know more about fatigue, its relationship to work hours, stress conditions, rest periods, and diet, and ultimately to overall performance, quality, and safety.</p>
<p>2. Owners, constructors, and consultants need to analyze the construction schedule set for rapid renewal projects to determine the potential for fatigue on the overall workforce. This will include some analysis of the number of shifts required along with the time allotted for potential rest periods.</p>
<p>3. Finally, it is important that owners, constructors, and consultants understand the impact of how fatigue in individuals collectively causes stress and deterioration in team working relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Project Objective</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this project is to develop a best practices toolbox that can be used in reducing workforce fatigue on rapid renewal projects. The toolbox will include: (1) recommendations for reducing workforce fatigue and improving safety, (2) fatigue risk management plans; and (3) guidelines for implementation and training materials, including those for management that address team fatigue and increased stress.</p>
<p>The researcher will be expected to:<br />&nbsp; &#61656; &nbsp;Document and assess the impact of human fatigue on work activities commonly associated with rapid renewal highway construction projects, including the impact on safety, quality, cost, and schedule.<br />&nbsp; &#61656; &nbsp;Develop strategies for organizing, structuring, and executing rapid renewal projects that incorporate fatigue reduction techniques into the project planning process.<br />&nbsp; &#61656; &nbsp;Evaluate a range of techniques that reduce fatigue and its effects on the workforce.<br />&nbsp; &#61656;&nbsp; Develop strategies for educating the community and its leaders on the importance of mitigating fatigue on rapid renewal projects.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<p><em>Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objective. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach to meet the research objective(s):</em></p>
<p><em>Phase I</em></p>
<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> Identify and discuss typical highway renewal scenarios that are expected to become more common in the future. The scenarios should at a minimum include extended-shift day work, continuous night work, continuous work (24/7), and continuous intense multi-year projects.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> Review industrial, construction, military, and other fatigue literature and identify those factors that may lead to fatigue in the highway construction workforce in a rapid renewal environment. The review should be clearly stratified to address different classifications of the construction workforce (e.g., workers, inspectors, managers, and designers) as well as by project type (e.g., time of day, length of work period, work location relative to traffic). The review should address the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;The linkage between workforce fatigue and actual and potential types of accidents, work quality, and productivity. <br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;The impact that working adjacent to high-speed traffic may have on worker fatigue, work quality, and productivity. <br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;The impact of the different rapid renewal scenarios on worker fatigue, work quality, and productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Prepare and submit a detailed plan to assess the ways fatigue may influence performance on highway renewal projects. The plan should at a minimum consider:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Conducting a survey of a cross section of workers and managers who have worked on rapid renewal projects to collect information on the extent of fatigue on individuals, knowledge of fatigue and its impact on performance rates, and quality of work. The plan for conducting the survey should include how to identify potential participants, what questions would be asked, how would the information be compiled and analyzed, what are special considerations in collecting data, including possible Institutional Review Board approval for human subjects research.<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Assessing the potential impact on employee performance, accident records, turnover, team building, etc.<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Assessing the impact of project organizational structure and its effect on fatigue on highway renewal projects. <br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Assessing the viability of comparing data from on-going or completed highway renewal projects in each of the scenarios identified in Task 1 to traditional projects, with daytime work schedules of 8-10 hours. <br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Identify potential projects from which data may be obtained.</p>
<p><em>The plan will be reviewed by SHRP 2. The contractor must obtain approval of the plan before moving forward with successive tasks.</em></p>
<p><strong>Task 4:</strong> Document and assess the ways fatigue may influence performance on highway renewal projects based on the approved plan from Task 3. Identify best practices for mitigating fatigue on highway renewal projects. The best practices should explore the use of different project organizational structures in the reduction of fatigue on renewal projects.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5:</strong> Identify a range of tools/techniques including education of the renewal workforce that can be used in fatigue risk management plans for mitigating fatigue on highway renewal projects. The tools/techniques should consider ways to mitigate fatigue during work hours and between work shifts. These techniques should clearly identify those fatigue-mitigating measures that relate to the various renewal scenarios that are expected to become more common in the future. The specifics of working adjacent to traffic and how workers can be aware of how fatigue and alertness may impact their reaction times and overall well-being should also be considered.</p>
<p><strong>Task 6:</strong> Identify and discuss promising tools/techniques for use in fatigue risk management plans for mitigating fatigue on highway renewal projects.</p>
<p><strong>Task 7:</strong> Examine the potential market size of the highway construction workforce needs over the next 10 years. Determine the potential number of rapid renewal projects that might be included in the overall program. Determine the impact this renewal effort will have on the overall workforce, including potential impact on safety, worker turnover, and worker training needs.</p>
<p><strong>Task 8:</strong> Develop and submit a Phase I interim report detailing all of the work conducted in the preceding tasks and provide a work plan for Phase II. The Phase II work plan should present a detailed description of how all of the tasks in Phase II will be accomplished.</p>
<p><em>The Phase I report for this project will be reviewed by SHRP 2 to consider the proposed work plan for Phase II, and to determine whether this contract should continue into Phase II.</em></p>
<p><br /><em>Phase II</em></p>
<p><em>After approval of the work plan developed in Phase I, and on receipt of notice to proceed to Phase II, conduct the following tasks:</em></p>
<p><strong>Task 9:</strong> Develop fatigue risk management plans for mitigating fatigue on highway renewal projects. The fatigue risk management plans should include the promising tools/techniques identified in Phase I.</p>
<p><strong>Task 10:</strong> Identify and discuss performance metrics needed in order to determine the level of success of the fatigue risk management plans. Specify in detail the metrics that are required to define the success of the strategies. The discussion should include the availability of data.</p>
<p><strong>Task 11:</strong> Identify and discuss different ways that DOTs and contractors could deal with overall fatigue and its impact on team building and decision making.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Task 12:</strong> Develop draft guidelines for the implementation of comprehensive fatigue risk management plans including the perspective of the owners, constructors, and consultants.</p>
<p><strong>Task 13:</strong> Develop draft training materials that can be used to assist in the implementation of the comprehensive fatigue risk management guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Task 14:</strong> Develop a draft outreach program to include a discussion on fatigue and its impact on performance and safety in a rapid renewal environment. Discuss various toolbox solutions. The outreach program should also identify and discuss potential barriers to implementation and provide suggestions on overcoming those barriers.</p>
<p><strong>Task 15:</strong> Develop broad strategic plans to assist DOTs and contractors in (1) understanding the situations, (2) adjusting training and outreach efforts, (3) identifying ways to provide incentives to the workforce to work in these environments and be rewarded for exceptional performance, and (4) monitoring the performance of the fatigue mitigation strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Task 16:</strong> Submit a Final Report detailing all work completed in the previous tasks. The final report should include refined: fatigue risk management plans, a toolbox of best practices, guidelines for implementation, and training materials.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Deliverables <br /></strong>&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Task 3 Work Plan<br />&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Phase I Report and Phase II Work Plan<br />&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Final Report<br />&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Monthly and Quarterly Progress Reports<br />&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; Three (3) interim team meetings with SHRP 2 staff, two (2) in Washington, DC, and one (1) at the contractor's facility<br />&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; One (1) interim meeting with the TCC in Washington, DC; Irvine, CA; or Woods Hole, MA <br />&nbsp; 7. &nbsp;Telephone conference calls and web meetings as needed.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Capacity<br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> C20<br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Freight Demand Modeling and Data Improvement Strategic Plan<br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> March 10, 2009</p>
<p><br /><strong>SHRP 2 Background</strong><br />To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); improved travel time reliability through congestion reduction (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with total program duration of 7 years. Additional information about SHRP 2 can be found on the program's Web site at <a href="http://www.trb.org/shrp2">www.trb.org/shrp2</a>.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Capacity Focus Area</strong><br />The objective of the Capacity focus area is to develop a consistent framework for reaching balanced, collaborative decisions on enhancing transportation capacity and to provide the tools for applying the framework. The research will develop a project evaluation process that will help stakeholders balance the need to reduce delays caused by conflicting demands with the need to produce transportation solutions that support community, economic, and environmental goals. The research will also develop a structure for a project's many contributors to share data and knowledge. This will require identifying critical points for decision making in various processes, the data and knowledge required for these decisions, and successful methods of sharing information.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Background</strong><br />Many in the transportation community believe that there is an impending crisis with respect to capacity to move freight both inside and beyond metropolitan areas. Moreover, much of the fixed freight transportation infrastructure is reaching the end of its economic life and is not being replaced with equal or more efficient capital. Freight traffic has been growing at a rate much faster than passenger traffic. Freight bottlenecks are evident in all parts of the nation and span all modes of transportation. Understanding and being able to forecast freight traffic is a critical input to planning for future highway capacity. Globalization of the economy means that this problem has large international implications. Understanding freight flows and forecasting them is critical to determining the need for future transportation capacity, whether in terms of highways or other modes. Yet neither the general public nor many decision makers really appreciate the critical economic role that freight transportation plays. Freight transportation routes and facilities often suffer from the "not in my backyard" (NIMBY) phenomenon. Public freight debates are often directed more at mitigating real and perceived negative impacts than toward achieving net positive economic impacts. [Proposers should see Special Note E for an important reference on the state of the practice of freight demand modeling].</p>
<p>At the same time, our ability to forecast freight traffic is universally understood to be in a primitive state. The prevailing approach to freight demand modeling mimics the passenger travel demand modeling process in terms of both theory and tools. Unfortunately, this approach is neither theoretically sound nor effective. Freight demand is much more heterogeneous in nature than passenger demand. Temporal variations in demand can be very large for freight. One type of model simply does not fit all the facets of the market. Through or "external" trips are much more important to consider in the freight world, both among regions and across international boundaries. There is considerable and complex interaction between international and domestic flows. New approaches are needed to truly capture the great variety in public policy and business issues, economic geography, modes, carriers, commodities, shippers, and receivers that exist in the freight world.</p>
<p>There are enormous economic and financial risks associated with being wrong in understanding the need for future freight capacity, whether for highways or other facilities. An expected emphasis on making highway renewal decisions that produce longer lasting major infrastructure investments means that being wrong about forecasts could have huge, negative consequences for the economy and the environment. Much more robust forecasts will be needed.</p>
<p>Freight has become a major issue for state and metropolitan transportation planners in relatively recent times, which explains the some of the lag of freight forecasting models behind urban travel demand models. Planners and public officials are only now beginning to formulate a wide range of policy questions requiring freight forecasts. These questions require an understanding of complex supply chains involving many shippers and carriers, relationships between the public and private sectors, and interactions among sectors of the economy and economic regions that generally ignore political boundaries. This understanding is not well supported by robust theory, well-developed computational methods, or effective visualization methods for communicating results.</p>
<p>Freight forecasts are also hindered by data "dead zones" in national data sets, requiring creative estimation methods to fill the gaps. Data on local freight movements are rare, as are methods to link data on local and interregional freight movements. The significant role of private carriers and shippers in freight transportation and their reluctance to share their data for competitive reasons are key challenges. Tracking systems and other information technology show promise as a new source of freight data, but typically require integration with more tradition data sources to provide an effective picture of freight movement.</p>
<p>Many conversations about freight capacity that need to be held between the public and private sectors are not occurring because there is limited data and analysis to support an informed dialog and improved partnerships. Public sector agencies are forced to act in a reactive mode with respect to future freight demand and the investments and policies needed to support freight movement.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong><br />This project is intended primarily to foster fresh ideas and new approaches to designing and implementing freight demand modeling rather than to make short-run, incremental improvements to existing models and data sources. The world of freight is too big and too complex to understand without the help of models, but today's models are letting us down in many ways. This project strives for a fresh look at both freight demand modeling and freight data in the context of policies that must be analyzed and decisions that will need to be made in the future. Achieving a major breakthrough in the way that freight demand modeling is done is the primary objective of this project. It is appropriate to conceptualize this $550,000 project as the first phase of a much larger project that achieves major breakthroughs; this project lays the groundwork, initiates innovation on a number of fronts, and documents needed research problem statements for a sustainable "road map" to the future of freight travel demand modeling and data provision. We expect the project to produce a Freight Demand Modeling and Data Improvement Strategic Plan but also to initiate steps toward implementing items in the strategic plan.</p>
<p>The following sub-objectives are to be achieved:</p>
<p>1. To define the strategic needs and seed research in freight demand modeling and freight data. Although a strategic research "road map" for improving freight demand modeling and freight data is a desired outcome of this project, fostering potential breakthroughs in thinking, tools, and practice is the primary intent of the project. Potential breakthroughs need to be inspired or identified so that the most promising can be pursued through subsequent research and development.</p>
<p>2. To foster a host of innovative research projects such that a dramatic breakthrough in freight demand modeling tools, freight data, and freight modeling and forecasting practice can be achieved within a 10-year time frame. This includes breakthroughs and knowledge transfer in theory; modeling technology and computation; analysis; data collection and integration; and output, communication, and visualization of results. Improvements should occur at a variety of geographic scales, e.g., at the international, national, mega-regional, metropolitan, and project levels, and should apply to all modes of freight transportation that use, complement, or compete with the highway system. New thinking should better accommodate freight business concepts such as supply chains, truck tours, and optimal asset management.</p>
<p>3. To stimulate innovative and promising research in freight demand modeling and freight data so that pressing public policy issues such as impacts on the economy and jobs, infrastructure investment priorities, energy, greenhouse gases, other environmental concerns, security, internalizing social costs, facility pricing, demand management, strategic bottlenecks, and shifts among modes can be addressed in a more effective manner than current models and data sources allow.</p>
<p>4. To encourage the application of modeling and data improvement ideas from other fields such as public utilities, telecommunications, and natural resources to achieve breakthroughs in thinking and practice.</p>
<p>5. To initiate a multisponsor structure that can sustain critical research and innovation in freight demand modeling and data into the future. Additional funding is anticipated be needed to fully implement the freight demand modeling and data improvement strategic plan that is initiated and mapped out by this project.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<p><em>Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objectives for this project. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach to meeting the research objectives.</em></p>
<p><br /><strong>Task 1:</strong> Establish a high level Steering Committee to set and maintain the vision and direction for this project. This committee should represent freight demand modeling and data practitioners, demand modeling and data users, other stakeholders and agencies and academic institutions that could be instrumental in funding further innovation and research, and experts in fostering of technological and scientific innovation. Proposers should indicate the groups of stakeholders and agencies that should be represented on the Steering Committee. Proposers should be aware that the SHRP 2 Program will appoint an independent Technical-Expert Task Group (TETG) to monitor the progress of this project and review its deliverables.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> Prepare a comprehensive Background Report on which to base later tasks in the project. Subtasks should include a series of Technical Memoranda that:<br />&nbsp; a. &nbsp;Develop an in-depth scan of the current state of domestic practice in freight demand modeling and data. The scan should identify stakeholder and user needs, strengths, weaknesses, threats, opportunities, and critical issues that need to be addressed through innovation and research. While this task is not intended to produce a conventional literature review, proposers should leverage recent core research such as National Cooperative Highway Research Program Synthesis 384, Forecasting Metropolitan Commercial and Freight Travel (2008).<br />&nbsp; b. &nbsp;Prepare a best practices and innovations review. The contractor should seek out and document domestic and international best practices and innovations that already exist and could be "springboards" to the future if seeded and promoted. It would appear that other nations (e.g., those in the European Union) are ahead of the United States in terms of freight demand modeling and data. Their practices should be better understood by domestic stakeholders and technicians. <br />&nbsp; c. &nbsp;Prepare a technology assessment to determine where freight demand modeling and data are likely to go in the next decade based on technological developments in such areas as modeling theory, computation, computer software, geographic information systems and databases, global positioning and other location-based technologies, radio frequency identifier tags, transponders, and intelligent transportation systems.<br />&nbsp; d. &nbsp;Review and document promising modeling and data developments in other fields-such as utilities, telecommunications, and natural resources-that could be applied to freight transportation, thus leading to breakthroughs in thinking and practice. This investigation should be international in scope.</p>
<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Design and plan a Freight Demand Modeling Innovation Program. The basic idea behind the Innovation Program is to search for, identify, showcase, and encourage promising new freight demand modeling paths that need to be explored and supported through future funding beyond the scope of this project. The Innovation Program needs to consider different levels of economic geography in freight demand modeling and data, for instance the need for planning at the international, "mega-region", statewide, metropolitan and small area/project levels. Needs for analytical tools and freight data could vary dramatically by geographic level.</p>
<p>Task 3 will involve preparing a detailed plan through which potential critical innovations are identified and innovative researchers are encouraged to contribute their ideas to the Strategic Plan. Proposers should indicate the types of groups (including international audiences and researchers from other fields) they would consider reaching out to during this task. Proposers should also indicate mechanisms they believe could be useful in reaching out to and encouraging active participation in the Strategic Plan by innovative researchers, including but not limited to design competitions, awards and incentives, focused conferences, poster sessions, on line forums and wikis, and webinars and other interactive on-line events. The plan will include a budget for any incentives that are proposed to support the participation of innovators and those will appear as a specific line item in the budget in this research proposal. [See Special Note F.]</p>
<p>(The Steering Committee and Technical-Expert Task Group described in Task 1 shall review and approve the results of Tasks 2 and 3 prior to the initiation of Task 4 of this project.)</p>
<p><strong>Task 4:</strong> Implement the Freight Demand Modeling Innovation Program. During this task, the Innovation Design and Plan developed in Task 3 (as modified to reflect the comments of the Steering Committee) will be carried out. The point of this task is to reach out to a large number of potential innovators and researchers inside and outside the freight demand modeling and data fields to identify, showcase, and document potential breakthrough innovations in data collection, computation and modeling, data analysis, considerations of risk and uncertainty, and communication of results.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5:</strong> Synthesize the results from Task 4. This task will involve assembling a portfolio of potential breakthrough innovations in need of more research. It may best be arrayed in a matrix by topic (e.g., communication of results) and geographic level (e.g., metropolitan level). The end result will be a series of detailed problem statements for needed research and innovation. The contractor should be prepared to suggest priorities for elements in the portfolio based on the results of Task 2. This task will in essence involve creating a draft version of the "Road Map" for improving freight demand modeling and data. [See Special Note G for examples of similar strategic research planning processes.]</p>
<p><strong>Task 6:</strong> Organize and convene a stakeholder conference to develop the final strategic plan. This task will involve convening a high-level stakeholder conference that will begin to work toward implementing the strategic plan for improving freight demand modeling and data. Attendees at this conference should include potential future funders of strategic research on freight demand modeling and data from both the public and private sectors. The contractor would provide a draft of the strategic plan for feedback within this forum. The conference should also include a discussion of how the effort to improve freight demand modeling and data is to be sustained so that it can be successfully implemented. Next steps and a structure for maintaining the effort should be clearly identified.</p>
<p><strong>Task 7:</strong> Document the outcome of Task 6: Final Strategic Plan. [Proposers should again refer to Special note G for references to examples of possibly applicable strategic research plan documents.]</p>
<p><br /><strong>Deliverables<br /></strong>Collectively, these deliverables will make up the Freight Demand Modeling and Data Improvement Strategic Plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 1. &nbsp;Technical Memoranda for the four components of Task 2. <br />&nbsp; 2. &nbsp;Background report that compiles and synthesizes the series of Technical Memoranda from Task 2. This report should be written so that it will be useful to a broad audience of stakeholders and users of freight models and data rather than just a narrow technical audience. <br />&nbsp; 3. &nbsp;Innovation Program Plan described in Task 3.<br />&nbsp; 4. &nbsp;Draft Report that synthesizes the results of Task 4. This report will in effect represent a portfolio of research and innovation proposals that are well-defined enough to be fundable in the future. An order of magnitude estimate of funding need should be provided as an indicator of suggested priority. It will be an input for Task 6 along with the Task 2 Background Report.</p>
<p><strong>Special Notes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Special Note A:</strong> Because of the interaction between projects, parallel timing of some projects, and tight schedule, it will be necessary for SHRP 2 researchers to coordinate with each other and with the SHRP 2 staff. Proposers should allow resources for at least two meetings in Washington, D.C. In addition, a SHRP 2 staff officer may request a briefing once or twice during the project at the researcher's offices.</p>
<p><strong>Special Note B:</strong> The contractor should also be prepared to monitor efforts in freight demand modeling and data that are under way at the US Department of Transportation, leading state departments of transportation, leading metropolitan traffic planning agencies, in academic institutions, and in the private sector throughout the duration of the research.</p>
<p><strong>Special Note C:</strong> The results of this project are envisioned as input for other projects in the SHRP 2 Capacity focus area, in particular project C15: Integrating Freight Considerations into the Collaborative Decision Making Framework for Additions to Highway Capacity. This project will be under way by late 2010. Proposers should be prepared to coordinate with the contractor for project C15.</p>
<p>There could also be synergies in Capacity project C10: Partnership to Develop an Integrated Advanced Travel Demand Model and a Fine-Grained, Time-Sensitive Network. This project should be under way in the fall of 2009. However, it should be understood that project C10 is almost entirely oriented toward achieving a breakthrough in how passenger travel demand modeling is done.</p>
<p>It is also important that contractors coordinate with ongoing National Cooperative Freight Research Program (NCFRP) projects that have to do with the development of a national architecture with freight data collection for local and project level analysis. Respectively, these are NCFRP projects 12 (under way) and 20 (anticipated). However, it should also be understood that NCFRP projects are usually oriented toward making short-term, incremental improvements in practices and tools. SHRP 2 Capacity Project C20 is intended to be more long-term in perspective and is also intended to foster a dramatic breakthrough in technologies and practices in freight demand modeling and data.</p>
<p><strong>Special Note D:</strong> Proposals will be evaluated by SHRP 2 staff and Expert Task Groups (ETGs) consisting of individuals collectively very knowledgeable in the problem areas. Selection of an agency is made by the SHRP 2 Oversight Committee, based on the recommendation of the SHRP 2 staff and the ETG. The following factors are considered: (1) the proposer's demonstrated understanding of the problem; (2) the merit of the proposed research approach and experimental design; (3) the experience, qualifications, and objectivity of the research team in the same or closely related problem area; (4) the proposer's plan for participation by disadvantaged business enterprises-small firms owned and controlled by minorities and women; and (5) the adequacy of facilities.</p>
<p>In the case of this particular project, the SHRP 2 staff and the ETG are expecting proposals from consulting teams with members and staff that have experience in conducting processes that foster research and innovation. Experience in preparing strategic research plans is critical, but not sufficient.</p>
<p><strong>Special Note E:</strong> A very important reference that proposers should consult in preparing their responses is Transportation Research Board Conference Proceedings C40, <em>Freight Demand Modeling: Tools for Public Sector Decision Making: Summary of a Conference</em>, September 2006, which is available on the TRB web site at: <a href="http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/conf/CP40.pdf">http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/conf/CP40.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>Special Note F:</strong> Special emphasis in the review of proposals will be given to creative approaches to encouraging the academic and professional communities to propose innovative theories, computational methods, visualization techniques, and other advances to the state of the art. The intent is to attract a wide variety of potential breakthrough concepts that show enough promise to warrant further research and development. Reviewers will be particularly interested in proposed uses of collaborative and competitive innovation processes that have worked in other fields of science and engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Special Note G:</strong> A useful example of a strategic research and innovation plan is the Federal Highway Administration's Concrete Pavement Road Map.</p>
<p>Federal Highway Administration, "The Concrete Pavement Road Map", Tech Brief Publication No. FHWA-HRT-05-074. Also see material related to the "Road Map" on the World Wide Web at:<br /><a href="http://www.cptechcenter.org/publications/task15/task15.cfm">http://www.cptechcenter.org/publications/task15/task15.cfm</a></p>
<p>A similar effort is currently under way with respect to preparing a Research Roadmap for Geospatial Information Technologies in Transportation at the Transportation Research Board.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Funds Available:</strong> Entire Project: $550,000<br />Budgets for project phases should be consistent with the level of effort proposed. As a guideline, the effort should be distributed as follows: Tasks 1 and 2 combined: 15 percent; Tasks 3 through 6 combined: 75 percent; Task 7: 10 percent.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Reliability<br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> L14<br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Effectiveness of Different Approaches to Disseminating Traveler Information on Travel Time Reliability<br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> March 10, 2009</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SHRP 2 Background</strong></p>
<p>To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); improved travel time reliability through congestion reduction (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with total program duration of 7 years. Additional information about SHRP 2 can be found on the program's Web site at <a href="http://www.trb.org/shrp2">www.trb.org/shrp2</a>.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Reliability Focus Area</strong></p>
<p>The major objective of SHRP 2 Reliability research is to greatly improve the reliability of highway travel times by reducing the frequency and effects of events that cause travel times to fluctuate in an unpredictable manner. The results of the research program should help local, state, and national agencies reduce travel time variability for travelers and shippers. The Reliability research plan addresses both recurring and nonrecurring congestion with an emphasis on nonrecurring congestion. The following seven potential sources of unreliable travel times (i.e., events that cause variable travel times) were identified: <br />&nbsp; 1. Traffic incidents <br />&nbsp; 2. Work zones <br />&nbsp; 3. Demand fluctuations <br />&nbsp; 4. Special events <br />&nbsp; 5. Traffic control devices <br />&nbsp; 6. Weather <br />&nbsp; 7. Inadequate base capacity.</p>
<p>The Reliability focus area targets travel time variation-that frustrating characteristic of the transportation system that means you must allow an hour to make a trip that normally takes 30 minutes. Not only is reliability an important component for travelers and shippers, it is also an area of the congestion problem in which transportation agencies can make significant gains even as travel demand grows. The seven unreliability sources account for approximately half of the total delay. Reducing reliability-related delay will also result in fewer crashes, reduced vehicle emissions and fuel use, and other benefits. These benefits can be realized through a mix of leading-edge research into a better understanding of strategies and their consequences, new technology and practices, and reducing institutional barriers so that our existing knowledge can be more fully exploited.</p>
<p>The goals of the Reliability focus area are built around the first five of the seven sources mentioned above. Work on weather-related issues will be coordinated with the Road Weather Management R&amp;D program under way at the Federal Highway Administration. Related research on inadequate base capacity being undertaken in the SHRP 2 Capacity focus area and elsewhere will be closely coordinated by SHRP 2 staff.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>A number of states and metropolitan areas communicate travel time information and related highway system condition data to travelers. Of roughly 100 metropolitan areas responding to a U.S. Department of Transportation survey conducted in 2006, 27 indicated they displayed travel time information on variable message signs. Besides variable message signs, other communications channels and technology platforms are used to communicate travel time information. These include broadcast media, satellite radio, the Internet, cell phone networks (e.g. 511 and other services for wireless devices), highway advisory radio, and telematics services such as General Motors' OnStar. Other information besides travel time that may be communicated includes travel speed, congestion, incident locations, alternative routes, work zone locations, and weather. In addition, a number of private sector companies also communicate travel time and related information to travelers through a variety of channels and on different technology platforms.</p>
<p>There is strong evidence based on empirical studies that road users are nearly as (if not more) concerned about travel time reliability as about average travel time. Individuals are concerned about being late for work and about missing other important appointments. Motor carriers may be faced with penalties for not meeting service agreements and delivering shipments late. Information about travel time reliability (as opposed to simple information on travel times) is much less frequently communicated to travelers at present. Only a few states and metropolitan areas provide such information for either pre-trip planning or for en route decision making by travelers. An example is Washington State DOT's 95 percent reliable travel time calculator for highways in the Puget Sound region, which travelers can access over the Internet for pre-trip planning.</p>
<p>Travelers do get considerable information about reliability from their own daily experiences. However, there is an overall lack of knowledge about what reliability information is useful to travelers, how best to communicate it to them, how reliability information impacts traveler choices and demand at given times on particular facilities, and how communicating information about reliability affects system performance, particularly in terms of nonrecurring highway congestion. It is recognized that travelers use multiple communications channels at different stages of their journey and also use them to gain additional intelligence about the transportation network and how conditions might affect their journey.</p>
<p>Part of the problem with communicating travel reliability information within the transportation network and to travelers is the lack of a shared language about reliability-a lexicon. There are many definitions of travel reliability and some are simply beyond the comprehension of travelers and most professionals. "Reliability" itself is a term of art that may have little meaning to the traveling public. On the other hand, some commonly used concepts such as "buffer time" seem to be intuitively understood by many. Travelers quickly learn to reserve additional time for some journeys on some routes in order to work around nonrecurring delays associated with things like incidents, bad weather, work zones, special events, and malfunctioning traffic control devices.</p>
<p>A key issue in this research is to find the right combinations of words, numbers, symbols, layout, lighting, color, and spacing to communicate information about travel time and reliability to travelers using a particular communications channel and technology platform. Another key issue is to find the best combination and arrangement of information so that travelers may make optimal travel choices from their point of view. Important choices include whether to take a trip or not, departure time, mode choice, and route choice.</p>
<p>Information about travel time reliability is important for free roads but also for priced roads, which are likely to become more prevalent. This project will be inherently more valuable in urban areas where nonrecurring congestion is most severe and widespread. Approximately half of all traffic congestion in urban areas is nonrecurring. This project will focus on urban areas, however, many of the research results could be transferable to rural areas that experience travel unreliability due to weather, incidents, and other sources of nonrecurring congestion. Almost all congestion in rural areas is nonrecurring in nature.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>This project has multiple objectives, which are to:</p>
<p>&nbsp; 1. &nbsp;Better understand the current and near-term future dimensions of the travel time/travel reliability information marketplace, including technologies, the roles of the public and private sectors, and choices (both free and priced) available to travelers.<br />&nbsp; 2. &nbsp;Better understand what network travel time and travel reliability information travelers require, particularly in complex metropolitan environments where many travel choices are possible.

<p><br /><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<p><em>Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objectives for this project. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach to meeting the research objectives.</em></p>
<p><em>Phase I</em></p>
<p>Phase I of this research project is intended to provide a strong knowledge base on which the design of Phase II of the project can be based. Phase I is intended to synthesize existing knowledge, while Phase II will develop new knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> Conduct and document a literature review focused on travel reliability information and its communication to travelers. The literature review should represent a critical examination of what is known about travel time reliability information and effective communication of such information to travelers. It should, for example address what is known about communication of information via different technology platforms, through different communication channels, with different message sets, symbologies, words and phrases, patterns and colors, and with different map features. Evaluations of existing practices, such as the use of changeable message signs, should be synthesized for key lessons learned. [See Special Note B]</p>
<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> Plan and conduct interviews with experts including but not limited to: <br />&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp; public sector traffic operations agencies, <br />&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp; metropolitan transportation planning agencies, <br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;public transit operators, academic researchers, <br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;private sector traveler information and travel reliability information providers, <br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;media companies, consumer electronics companies, and other key players to provide a knowledge base of recent experience (positive and negative).</p>
<p>The interviews should explore how to communicate reliability information to users, the general state of the nature and effectiveness of the practice today, and any plans for providing increased levels of travel time reliability information to travelers during the next five years. Identify critical gaps in knowledge that are relevant to the original research to be conducted during Phase II of the research. Finally, obtain any available expert opinions regarding the potential impacts of providing effective travel reliability information in terms of such indicators as customer satisfaction, impact on travel choices, and impact on system performance and reliability. [See Special Note C]</p>
<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Conduct and prepare a technology and innovation scan for the next five years to identify devices, software, information sources, and information services that will likely influence the improved provision of travel reliability information to end users. The scan should address both in-vehicle and other technologies and information and should also span both the public and private sectors. Continue to monitor developments in technology and innovation until the research design for Phase II of the project is completed. The pace of technological and service development is quite rapid, as evidenced in global positioning systems-based (GPS) technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Task 4:</strong> Based on the results from Tasks 1-3 above, distill a focused set of avenues of investigation for the original research to be conducted during Phase II. This task anticipates the need to develop a manageable experimental design for Phase II of the research. It is critical that during this task the contractor begin to focus their efforts; there is simply not enough time and budget and there are too many combinations of technology platforms, communications channels, message sets, and message formats for research to proceed unfocused and succeed. Develop a concise summary of selected, key gaps in our knowledge about how to effectively communicate reliability information to travelers and a preliminary set of research hypotheses that could effectively be explored during Phase II of the project. Consider communications channels, technology platforms, message content, and message format (e.g. words, graphics, symbols, colors, and arrangement). At a minimum, the contractor should consider how best to communicate average travel time and an indicator of the variability of travel time. In addition, where it makes sense, consider and account for the dollar cost of travel to be used in a later task to impute the values of average travel time and travel time reliability.</p>
<p><em>Phase II</em><br /><br />The bulk of time and budgetary resources for this research project should be directed to Phase II of the project. Phase II should produce new knowledge to improve the effectiveness of communicating travel reliability information to travelers.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5:</strong> Prepare a detailed management plan for Phase II of the research so that it can be conducted as effectively as possible within time and budgetary restrictions. Focused investigation is required during Phase II since there are a multitude of potential reliability information communications platforms, technologies, devices, messages, and message formats that could be evaluated and explored. The research management plan should provide that focus based on the knowledge base built during Phase I.</p>
<p><strong>Task 6:</strong> Develop an experimental framework, an experimental design, and data collection plan, and an analysis plan for Phase II of the study. The designs should be based on evaluating the effectiveness of a feasible and manageable set of travel time reliability information offerings and message sets that can be tested for effectiveness in communication to travelers through a set of laboratory experiments and simulations. The experimental design needs to address important travel choices (such as route choice, mode choice, and departure time choice) in addition to information about and formatting of travel time and travel time reliability. Choose experimental and simulation methods that are appropriate for the type of travel reliability information being communicated and the communications channel being utilized (e.g., desktop computer or personal digital assistant/Internet-enabled cell phone for pre-trip planning, driving simulator for en-route information, and field studies for validation.) This plan should also address quality assurance for data collection. This plan should include a methodology to identify potential study participants, questions to be asked, information to be compiled and analyzed, and special considerations in collecting data, including possible Institutional Review Board approval for human subjects research."</p>
<p><strong>Task 7:</strong> Assemble necessary equipment in appropriate locations and recruit the subjects needed for any experiments included in the experimental framework and experimental design. Proposals should include the costs of any equipment rental or purchase and any compensation that will be provided for experimental subjects. Any cooperative agreements required for experiments to be conducted should also be explained in the appropriate section of the proposal.<br /><br /><strong>Task 8:</strong> Perform data collection to support the experimental design outlined in Task 6. Ensure that all data are of appropriate quality and organize them so the remaining tasks can proceed efficiently. Ensure that all data collected as a part of this phase of the research can be preserved and archived. [See Special Note F]</p>
<p><strong>Task 9:</strong> Examine and analyze the data collected during Task 7 using statistical and other appropriate methods.</p>
<p><strong>Task 10:</strong> Draw valid conclusions from the data examination, statistical analysis, and other analysis conducted during Task 9.</p>
<p><strong>Task 11:</strong> Report the findings for the experimental portion of the Phase II research (Tasks 5 through 9). The report should emphasize findings about the types, formats, and content of message sets that are most effective in being understood and used by travelers and those that actually influence travel behavior that could lead to improved travel reliability. The report should also identify remaining gaps in knowledge that could be addressed by future research.</p>
<p><strong>Task 12:</strong> Based on the choices explored in the experiments and the information presented concerning average travel time, travel time reliability, and direct or indirect information on the costs of the alternatives, estimate utility functions that can be used to impute the average value of travel time and the value of travel time reliability. Document the analysis, findings, and conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>Task 13:</strong> Create a suggested lexicon for communicating key travel time reliability concepts and information both within the transportation profession and to the traveling public. In this lexicon, numbers, symbols, colors, auditory signals, and a host of other sensory triggers are as important as words.</p>
<p><strong>Task 14:</strong> Formulate and prioritize key guidelines for public sector traveler information and traffic operations professionals and state and metropolitan transportation agency managers based on the results of Phases I and II of the research. Priorities should, to the extent possible, derive from the results of Tasks 2 and 11. These guidelines should be communicated in the form of a Guidebook and Deployment Advisory on how best to introduce and provide reliability information to travelers so that such information is most likely to be understood and used by travelers. Determine and create the most effective form(s) for the Guidebook and Deployment Advisory, e.g., a printed document, a CD-ROM, and/or an on-line publication or a web-based tool. The Guidebook and Deployment Guide should include the lexicon developed during Task 13.</p>
<p><strong>Deliverables</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; 1. &nbsp;Report on Phase I of the research, preferably in a searchable form<br />&nbsp; 2. &nbsp;Phase II Research Management Plan in the form of a technical memorandum<br />&nbsp; 3. &nbsp;Experimental Design and Data Collection Plan for Phase II in the form of a technical memorandum<br />&nbsp; 4. &nbsp;A technical memorandum on the results from the original research conducted for Phase II of the research<br />&nbsp; 5. &nbsp;Guidebook and deployment advisory on communicating reliability information to travelers, including a travel time reliability lexicon<br />&nbsp; 6. &nbsp;Quarterly progress reports</p>
<p><strong>Special Notes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Special Note A:</strong> Because of the interaction between projects, parallel timing of some projects, and tight schedule, it will be necessary for SHRP 2 researchers to coordinate with each other and with the SHRP 2 staff. Proposers should allow resources for at least two meetings in Washington, D.C. In addition, a SHRP 2 staff officer may request a briefing once or twice during the project at the researcher's offices.</p>
<p><strong>Special Note B:</strong> The contractor should concentrate on reviewing recent literature--that published over the past five years. The review should be international in scope and while focusing on the highway mode, should be multimodal in scope since travelers' decision sets may involve a choice between modes. The literature review should communicate clearly the key findings of selected literature that is foundational to the remaining tasks in this research project.</p>
<p><strong>Special Note C:</strong> The contractor should also be prepared to monitor efforts in travel reliability information that are underway at the U.S. Department of Transportation, leading state departments of transportation, leading metropolitan traffic operations agencies, and in the private sector throughout the duration of the research.</p>
<p><strong>Special Note D:</strong> The results of this project are envisioned as input for other projects in the SHRP 2 Reliability focus area, in particular project L17, "A Framework for Improving Travel Time Reliability." This project will be under way by late 2010. Proposers should be prepared to coordinate with the contractor for project L17. The results of other, ongoing SHRP 2 Reliability projects will likely help to inform this project in terms of suggesting travel reliability information that could be communicated. These include in particular:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; L02: "Establishing Monitoring Programs for Travel Time Reliability"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; L11: "Evaluating Alternative Operations Strategies to Improve Travel Time Reliability"</p>
<p>Proposers should generally be prepared to coordinate with other contractors involved in SHRP 2 research projects where there are potential synergies.</p>
<p><strong>Special Note E:</strong> Proposals will be evaluated by SHRP 2 staff and Expert Task Groups (ETGs) consisting of individuals collectively very knowledgeable in problem area. Selection of an agency is made by the SHRP 2 Oversight Committee, based on the recommendation of the SHRP 2 staff and the ETG. The following factors are considered: (1) the proposer's demonstrated understanding of the problem; (2) the merit of the proposed research approach and experimental design; (3) the experience, qualifications, and objectivity of the research team in the same or closely related problem area; (4) the proposer's plan for participation by disadvantaged business enterprises-small firms owned and controlled by minorities and women; and (5) the adequacy of facilities.</p>
<p>In the case of this particular project, the SHRP 2 staff and ETG will be carefully looking for a multidisciplinary approach to the problem. The ideal team will include behavioral scientists, cognitive psychologists, social scientists, statisticians, communications experts, transportation engineers, transportation planners, and experts in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and traffic operations.</p>
<p><strong>Special Note F:</strong> The SHRP 2 Reliability Focus Area will, through project L13, determine the feasibility of developing an archive for travel reliability data for SHRP 2 Reliability and related projects. The L14 contractor should be prepared to supply any data collected and produced (structured and unstructured) for inclusion in the archive should it be developed.<br /><br /><strong>Funds Available:</strong> Entire Project: $1,000,000<br />Budgets for project phases should be consistent with the level of effort proposed. As a guideline, the effort should be distributed as follows:<br />Phase I: $150,000<br />Phase II: $850,000</p>
<p><strong>Contract Time:</strong> 24 months; Phase I: 4 months; Phase II: 20 months</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SHRP 2 Request for Proposals</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Renewal<br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> R06-G<br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> High-Speed Nondestructive Testing Methods for Mapping Voids, Debonding, Delaminations, Moisture, and Other Defects Behind or Within Tunnel Linings<br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> March 10, 2009</p>
<p><strong>SHRP 2 Background</strong><br />To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); congestion reduction through improved travel time reliability (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with total program duration of 7 years. Additional information about SHRP 2 can be found on the program's Web site at <a href="http://www.trb.org/shrp2">www.trb.org/shrp2</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Renewal Focus Area Background</strong><br />The U.S. highway system is aging and must be rebuilt while we are driving on it and living next to it. Research in the SHRP 2 Renewal focus area therefore addresses the need to develop a consistent, systematic approach to completing highway projects quickly, with minimal disruption to the community, and producing facilities that are long-lasting. Identifying new technologies for locating underground utilities; developing procedures to speed the evaluation of designs and the inspection of construction; and applying new methods and materials for preserving, rehabilitating, and reconstructing roadways and bridges are among the goals for this focus area. Alternative strategies for contracting, financing, and managing projects and mitigating institutional barriers also are part of the emphasis on rapid renewal. The renewal scope applies to all classes of roads.</p>
<p><strong>Project Background</strong><br />Periodic inspection of highway tunnels to assess changes in structural condition over time is critical to timely detection and remediation of problems to ensure road user safety. Tunnel structural problems that are considered widespread and potentially serious are tunnel leaks, concrete cracking, concrete spalling, concrete delamination, debonding, steel corrosion, and improper drainage. Monitoring of tunnel condition and deterioration rate is key to determining the appropriate schedule of maintenance and/or rehabilitation activities to remedy structural and safety problems that might lead to accelerated deterioration and sudden tunnel failures that could cause serious injury and even fatalities.</p>
<p>Tunnel inspection is a challenging problem. Tunnels typically service high volume traffic and operate in aggressive environments. Keeping tunnels open during inspection and minimizing tunnel closures and user delays must be carefully balanced with the need to conduct detailed inspections to ensure the safety of drivers. Consequently, nondestructive test methods that are automated, quantitative, and rapid, and that provide complete coverage compared to conventional visual inspections need to be identified and evaluated. However, there does not appear to be any high-speed nondestructive (NDT) testing method for assessing the condition of tunnel linings that would minimize the disruption of ongoing traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Project Objectives</strong><br />The objectives of the proposed research are:</p>
<p>&nbsp; - &nbsp;To identify NDT technologies for evaluating the condition (e.g., moisture, voids, and corrosion) of various types of tunnel linings (e.g., unreinforced concrete, reinforced concrete, shotcrete, and steel) and tunnel lining finishes such as tile. The techniques must be capable of analyzing conditions within the tunnel lining and the surrounding substrate;<br />&nbsp; - &nbsp;To evaluate the applicability, accuracy, precision, repeatability, ease of use, capacity to minimize disruption to vehicular traffic, and implementation and production costs of the identified technologies;<br />&nbsp; - &nbsp;To conduct the required development in hardware or software for those techniques that show potential for technological improvement within the time limitations of this project; <br />&nbsp; - &nbsp;To prove the validity of the selected technologies/techniques to detect flaws within or verify conditions of the targeted tunnel components; and<br />&nbsp; - &nbsp;To recommend test procedures and protocols to successfully implement these techniques.</p>
<p>Note: Evaluation, in the context of this project, is defined as both a rapid screening of the testing area and as an in-depth, although slower, assessment of an area deemed problematic during screening. In both cases, and based on SHRP 2 priorities, dependable NDT techniques that minimize disruption to traffic are sought under this project.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong><br /><em>Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objective. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach to meet the research objective(s):</em></p>
<p><em>Phase I</em></p>
<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> Conduct an international literature search to identify current and emerging NDT technologies and techniques for evaluating the condition (e.g., moisture, voids, and corrosion) of various types of tunnel linings (e.g., unreinforced concrete, reinforced concrete, shotcrete, and steel), tunnel lining finishes such as tile, and the surrounding substrate. The literature search should also include technologies used in other industries that have potential to detect and characterize deterioration within and beyond tunnel linings.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> From the literature review, categorize and rank the promising technologies for the given types of tunnel linings and the most common deterioration mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Propose for SHRP 2 approval an independent panel of experts well versed in operations, maintenance, and engineering of tunnels who will define the testing needs from the perspective of applicability, accuracy, precision, repeatability, ease of use, speed (to minimize disruption to traffic), and cost. These defined needs, in a quantitative form, will become the performance criteria or system requirements for the NDT technologies under development and testing.</p>
<p>A minimum of six volunteers is suggested for this independent panel. The panel shall be balanced to represent the various types of operational aspects that exist across the country and the various types of linings that are targeted for investigation in this project.</p>
<p><strong>Task 4:</strong> Upon approval from SHRP 2, conduct a working session with the independent panel to establish the testing criteria and prioritize the techniques to be developed and evaluated in subsequent tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5:</strong> Develop a detailed research and development (R&amp;D) plan for Phase II for the most promising NDT technologies. The plan will describe any additional hardware/software development proposed for those technologies. For all the recommended NDT techniques, the plan will include details on the testing criteria established in Task 4, the controlled laboratory and field testing for proof-of-concept and validation, the proposal for validation test beds (existing and/or to be constructed) for positive proof of the NDT techniques, and any envisioned numerical or physical modeling.</p>
<p><strong>Task 6:</strong> Prepare and submit a draft Phase I Report documenting Tasks 1-5.</p>
<p><strong>Task 7:</strong> Based on the review comments, prepare and submit a revised Phase I Report. Wait for SHRP 2 approval before proceeding to Phase II.</p>
<p><em>The SHRP 2 Technical Coordinating Committee for Highway Renewal will review the Phase I report to determine whether this contract should continue into Phase II. <br /><br />Phase II </em></p>
<p><em>After approval of the Phase I Report, and on receipt of direction to proceed, conduct the following tasks:</em></p>
<p><strong>Task 8:</strong> Conduct the necessary technology development (hardware and/or software) and perform proof-of-concept testing for those techniques recommended in the Phase I Report.</p>
<p><strong>Task 9:</strong> Conduct field validation testing to evaluate the recommended technologies for each type of tunnel lining and deterioration type (moisture, corrosion, delamination, debonding, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Task 10:</strong> Prepare an Interim Report documenting the accuracy, precision, repeatability, calibration procedures, testing procedures, cost, limitations, data management, and data analysis and interpretation for each of the NDT techniques tested. Recommend the most promising technologies for field implementation based on the performance criteria established in Phase I. This report will be submitted to SHRP 2 and shared with the independent panel of experts in preparation for Task 11.</p>
<p><strong>Task 11:</strong> Conduct a working session with the independent panel of experts to discuss the findings in Tasks 8 and 9. Document the working session and revise the Interim Report for submission to SHRP 2. The revised Interim Report must provide the final recommendations for protocol development in subsequent tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Task 12:</strong> Develop a User's Manual for the final recommended technologies. The manual shall include detailed information on the following: equipment and systems integration requirements, test procedures, inspector's training requirements, data management procedures, data analysis procedures, and interpretation guidelines. For each NDT technique, the manual must also address its limitations (e.g., technical, operational, environmental).</p>
<p><strong>Task 13:</strong> Prepare recommendations for implementation of these NDT techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Task 14:</strong> Prepare and submit a Draft Final Report documenting Tasks 1 through 13.</p>
<p><strong>Task 15:</strong> Based on the review comments, prepare and submit to SHRP 2 a revised Final Report.</p>
<p><strong>Deliverables </strong></p>

<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Renewal<br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> R10<br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Project Management Strategies for Complex Projects<br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> March 10, 2009</p>
<p><strong>SHRP 2 Background<br /></strong>To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); improved travel time reliability through congestion reduction (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with total program duration of 7 years. Additional information about SHRP 2 can be found on the program's Web site at <a href="http://www.trb.org/shrp2">www.trb.org/shrp2</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Focus Area Background</strong><br />The U.S. highway system is aging and must be rebuilt while we are driving on it and living next to it. Research in the SHRP 2 Renewal focus area therefore addresses the need to complete highway projects quickly, with minimal disruption to the community, and to produce facilities that are long-lasting. Identifying new technologies for locating underground utilities; developing procedures to speed the evaluation of designs and the inspection of construction; and applying new methods and materials for preserving, rehabilitating, and reconstructing roadways and bridges are among the goals for this focus area. Alternative strategies for contracting, financing, and managing projects and mitigating institutional barriers also are part of the emphasis on rapid renewal.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Background</strong><br />This project will address the managerial, engineering, overall coordination, and workforce challenges associated with rapid renewal projects. Rapid or accelerated projects typically involve complex logistical requirements, contractual procedures, and restrictive regulatory requirements that need careful planning and execution from inception to construction completion. Rapid renewal projects may range in size from moderately small to very large complex megaprojects - each requiring a unique set of skills and approaches to ensure success. Larger projects may require multiple contracts which further complicate these efforts. Projects can be complex in size, scope, and level of coordination required.</p>
<p>Transportation agencies (TAs), contractors, consulting engineers, and other stakeholders will have to ensure that strong partnerships are in place that may be very different from traditional approaches. For example, the roles of the TA in the design-build process, implementation and execution of project warranties, implementation of full road closures, and other unique approaches, are very different from the traditional organization approaches in highway construction. The decision-making practices and commitments of each of these entities must be harmonized to promote cooperation and efficiency.</p>
<p>A systematic research effort is required to study the unique requirements of rapid renewal projects. The research should describe how TAs, contractors, consulting engineers, and other stakeholders work together on such projects including how they:<br />&nbsp; 1. &nbsp;Configure lines of communication and authority <br />&nbsp; 2. &nbsp;Organize to promote harmonization of project activities <br />&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Utilize decision-making mechanisms to promote efficiency and ensure that appropriate project decisions are made at appropriate levels and times<br />&nbsp; 4. &nbsp;Establish streamlined processes to minimize the impact of state and federal requirements. <br />&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; Develop common goals and approaches to meet those goals</p>
<p><strong>Project Objective</strong><br />The objective of this project is to provide transportation agencies with tools that can be used to develop innovative and effective project management strategies that will accelerate sound decision-making during rapid renewal projects. The tools will include:<br />&nbsp; &#61656; &nbsp;A guidebook for innovative project management<br />&nbsp; &#61656; &nbsp;Example case studies of project management strategies for complex projects<br />&nbsp; &#61656; &nbsp;Workshop and training packages to support adoption of these management strategies by all stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong><br /><em>Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objective. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach to meet the research objective(s).</em></p>
<p><em>Phase I</em></p>
<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> Review national and international literature and survey public and private agencies for project management strategies for complex transportation projects in a rapid renewal environment to establish the state of the practice. The review should include transportation agencies that vary in function and projects from a broad spectrum of project delivery methods (e.g., PPP, design-build, design-bid-build, etc.) that are geographically diverse and vary in size from moderately small to large mega projects.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> Analyze the project management approaches documented in task 1 and determine best practices. In addition to organizing best practices by project delivery method, identify those best practices that are common success factors across all delivery methods. The analysis should clearly define innovative implementation strategies, methods, and tools that led to successful outcomes. Examples of categories of successful outcomes may include but are not limited to: managerial, engineering, overall coordination, and workforce challenges associated with rapid renewal projects. Compile common lessons learned from all approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Develop and submit a Phase I interim report detailing all of the work conducted in the preceding tasks and provide a work plan for Phase II. Include in the work plan a discussion on the rationale and criteria that will be used to select the case studies. The Phase II work plan should present a detailed description of how all of the tasks in Phase II will be accomplished, and a tentative list of potential case studies that will be developed in Phase II.</p>
<p><em>The Phase I report for this project will be reviewed by SHRP 2 to consider the proposed work plan for Phase II, and to determine whether this contract should continue into Phase II. </em></p>
<p><em>Phase II<br />After approval of the work plan developed in Phase I and on receipt of notice to proceed to Phase II, conduct the following tasks:</em></p>
<p><br /><strong>Task 4:</strong> Develop case studies based on literature review and interviews with transportation agency, contractor, and consultant personnel to expand on the successful project management strategies assessed in Phase I. The case studies should indentify the barriers to implementation and the tools and methods that were used to overcome those barriers.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5:</strong> Document and analyze the information from the case studies and provide a detailed review of the elements of each project that lead to success.</p>
<p><strong>Task 6:</strong> Develop and present an outline of the draft guide, workshop materials, and workshop approach on effective project management strategies. It is anticipated that the researcher will present the outline to a SHRP 2 designated committee via a web conference for review, comment, and approval prior to drafting the guide. The presentation should contain relevant information from the previous tasks.<br /><br /><em>Approval from SHRP 2 is required prior to developing the draft guide and workshop materials.</em></p>
<p><strong>Task 7:</strong> Develop a draft guide and workshop materials on effective project management strategies for complex transportation projects in a rapid renewal environment.<br /><br /><strong>Task 8:</strong> Conduct pilot workshops at a minimum of two TAs to test the applicability of the guide. The workshops shall include a cross section of TAs functional staff and project managers with varying levels of project management experience. Attendees to these workshops may include transportation agency, contractors, consultants, and other key stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>Task 9:</strong> Refine guide and workshop materials based on feedback received from pilot workshops.</p>
<p><strong>Task 10:</strong> Submit a Phase II interim report detailing all work accomplished in Phase II and provide a work plan for Phase III including the workshop format and approach.</p>
<p><em>The Phase II report for this project will be reviewed by SHRP 2 to consider the proposed work plan for Phase III, and to determine whether this contract should continue into Phase III. </em></p>
<p><em>After approval of the work plan developed in Phase II and on receipt of notice to proceed to Phase III, conduct the following tasks:</em></p>
<p><em>Phase III</em><br /><strong>Task 11:</strong> Conduct a one-day regional workshop for each AASHTO region. The attendees should include project and program managers who are responsible for making project management decisions. The attendees should include both TA and contractor personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Task 12:</strong> Refine guide and workshop materials based on feedback from the regional workshops and develop a training program consistent with the National Highway Institute course development protocols <a href="http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/resources.aspx">http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/resources.aspx</a>. Proposers should discuss their approach to meet NHI requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Task 13:</strong> Prepare and submit a Final Report documenting the entire project.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Deliverables</strong> <br />&nbsp; 1. &nbsp;Phase I Report and Phase II Work Plan<br />&nbsp; 2. &nbsp;Case Studies (Task 5)<br />&nbsp; 3. &nbsp;Outline of draft guide and workshop materials. <br />&nbsp; 4. &nbsp;Phase II Report and Phase III Work Plan<br />&nbsp; 5. &nbsp;Guide, workshop materials, and training program <br />&nbsp; 6. &nbsp;Final Report<br />&nbsp; 7. &nbsp;Monthly and Quarterly Progress Reports<br />&nbsp; 8. &nbsp;Three (3) interim team meetings with SHRP 2 staff, two (2) in Washington, DC, and one (1) at the contractor's facility<br />&nbsp; 9. &nbsp;One (1) interim meeting with the TCC in Washington, DC; Irvine, CA; or Woods Hole, MA <br />&nbsp; 10. &nbsp;Telephone conference calls and web meetings as needed.</p>

<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Renewal<br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> R11<br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Strategic Approaches at the Corridor and Network Levels to Minimize Disruption from the Renewal Process <br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> March 10, 2009</p>
<p><br /><strong>SHRP 2 Background</strong></p>
<p>To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); congestion reduction through improved travel time reliability (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with total program duration of 7 years. <br /><br /><strong>Renewal Focus Area</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. highway system is aging and must be rebuilt while we are driving on it and living next to it. Research in the SHRP 2 Renewal focus area therefore addresses the need to develop a consistent, systematic approach to completing highway projects quickly, with minimal disruption to the community, and producing facilities that are long-lasting. Identifying new technologies for locating underground utilities; developing procedures to speed the evaluation of designs and the inspection of construction; and applying new methods and materials for preserving, rehabilitating, and reconstructing roadways and bridges are among the goals for this focus area. Alternative strategies for contracting, financing, and managing projects and mitigating institutional barriers also are part of the emphasis on rapid renewal. The renewal scope applies to all classes of roads.</p>
<p><strong>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>Over the last several years, the transportation planning community has begun using the concept of corridor and network management to describe the current status and future needs for transportation improvements. However, the transportation corridor and network analysis at the planning stage may not consider the entirety of infrastructure needs within that corridor and/or network. The analysis may not consider the impact that significantly different project execution strategies may have on the overall budget, disruption to traveling public, disruption to commerce, and impacts on the local community during the actual construction operations. Decisions made during planning can enhance or constrain opportunities to accelerate construction or minimize disruption. These decisions may also overlook opportunities to minimize the number of construction interventions ultimately required in a corridor.</p>
<p>Many transportation corridors and networks are becoming increasingly congested, limiting construction during traditional work times. Public agencies are now recognizing the need to examine various construction alternatives within those corridors and networks to determine the potential disruption and/or benefit these alternatives may have over time. In addition, many public agencies are anticipating the need to examine regional networks with multiple corridors in order to examine the effect of constructing multiple corridors concurrently. Without examination of the various construction strategies during the project development process, the impact on the traveling public and the local communities may increase dramatically.</p>
<p>Future corridor and network improvement analyses need to address a variety of important questions, such as:<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;What is the optimal selection of renewal project features-roadway, bridge, soils, drainage, safety improvements, signing, and other upgrades-that should be packaged into discreet construction contracts?<br />&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp; How should public agencies address those components within the corridor that have significantly different remaining service lives?<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;How should geographic construction limits be set to minimize disruption to the traveling public, businesses, and adjacent communities?<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;What is the impact on the regional network when multiple corridors are being considered for concurrent reconstruction or are there phasing strategies which may minimize impacts on the regional network?<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;What is the best way to define and measure the benefits gained and limitations from various strategies as they relate to work accomplished, budget, traffic mitigation, and safety and related benefits?</p>
<p><br /><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of this project are:</p>
<p>&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; To identify and document effective practices for executing highway renewal activities as they affect the corridor and network level by considering construction alternatives, budget limitations, adjacent communities and impact to the traveling public;<br />&nbsp; (2) &nbsp;To identify instances and examples of the transportation agency and project organizational designs that are most and least compatible with these effective practices; <br />&nbsp; (3) &nbsp;To identify and develop new dynamic tools, techniques, and processes to help public agencies execute highway renewal activities at the corridor and network level and measure risks from the perspective of constructability, funding, economic/environmental/social constraints, and congestion and safety impacts;<br />&nbsp; (4) &nbsp;To provide guidance for selecting appropriate tools, techniques, performance measures, and practices during project development (i.e., from planning through construction); and <br />&nbsp; (5) &nbsp;To assess and develop training needs and materials and knowledge transfer methods for implementation.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Tasks</strong> <br />Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objectives. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach to meeting the research objectives.</p>
<p><em>Phase I:</em> <strong>Investigation of current successes, and opportunities for improvement and identification of effective rapid renewal corridor and network practices</strong></p>
<p>Task 1: Review relevant literature, pertinent research and other appropriate information sources to identify current practices for minimizing transportation disruption during renewal activities of highway corridors/networks as they relate to: <br />&nbsp; - &nbsp;Project sequencing <br />&nbsp; -&nbsp; Project delivery and procurement methods <br />&nbsp; -&nbsp; Construction industry input or experience in the planning and preconstruction project development process<br />&nbsp; -&nbsp; Consideration of construction means, methods and techniques and associated design requirements early in the project development process<br />&nbsp; - &nbsp;Consideration of periodic constructability reviews (both for building and bidding) throughout the project development process <br />&nbsp; - &nbsp;Impacts and limitations on the construction industry as a result of possible longer project limits and the inclusion of more work within the traditional construction projects<br />&nbsp; - &nbsp;Other considerations.</p>
<p>Examine the current processes to determine when and how public agencies establish project limits and priorities based on specific metrics, including the type and extent of work limits, work items, and traffic management, as well as contractor's expertise and business structure.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> Investigate how significantly different approaches are integrated into corridor and network traffic management to minimize disruption and what the results of those practices provide in terms of net traffic disruption, for example:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Examine total or partial shutdown of corridors with high-intensity work effort.<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Examine incentives and disincentives to support rapid renewal of corridors<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Examine short-duration closures (six hours or less) over longer periods of time.<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Examine the impact of grouping nontraffic-impacting work into discrete packages separate from traffic-impacting work.<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Examine the options of programming renewal activities within a corridor by elements (e.g., culvert replacements) vs. traditional segment construction vs. project delivery method (e.g., design-build)</p>
<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Identify and evaluate practices that analyze total traffic impact on traveling public, local community and business, and commerce at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">corridor</span> level as a result of various strategies for performing renewal.</p>
<p><strong>Task 4:</strong> Identify and evaluate practices that analyze total traffic impact on traveling public, local community and business, and commerce at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">network</span> level as a result of various strategies for performing renewal.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5:</strong> Develop recommendations detailing effective practices and methodologies that can be generally applied among transportation agencies. A selection matrix that correlates effective practices to specific application situations is anticipated as a likely product of this task.</p>
<p><strong>Task 6:</strong> Identify and evaluate various tools (e.g., software, models, algorithms) that in whole or in part support the recommended practices developed in Task 5. For each tool, the strengths, weaknesses, and barriers to implementation should be identified.</p>
<p><strong>Task 7:</strong> Based on Task 6, provide recommendations and estimated resources (cost and time) to improve existing and/or develop new tools under this contract.</p>
<p><strong>Task 8:</strong> Prepare a Phase I Report documenting Tasks 1-7. Submit the report to SHRP 2 for review and approval.</p>
<p><em>Phase II:</em> <strong>Corridor and Network Analysis Tools</strong></p>
<p>After approval of the Phase I Report, and on receipt of direction to proceed, conduct the following tasks:</p>
<p><strong>Task 9:</strong> Based on the recommendations from Task 7, develop new dynamic tools, techniques, and/or processes to help public agencies plan highway renewal activities at the corridor and network level and to measure associated risks. The tools should provide the ability to analyze life-cycle costs associated with various corridor renewal strategies and the ability to estimate disruption to traffic flows, community services and fabric, and regional and local economies.</p>
<p><strong>Task 10:</strong> Develop guidance for selecting the proper tools, techniques, performance measures, and practices during project development (i.e., from planning through construction).</p>
<p><strong>Task 11:</strong> Prepare and submit to SHRP 2 a Phase II Report documenting tasks 9-10.</p>
<p><br /><em>Phase III:</em> <strong>Piloting and Knowledge Transfer</strong></p>
<p><strong>Task 12:</strong> After the Phase I report is approved, conduct at least two pilot workshops (aimed at different audiences) to test the practices identified during Phase I (task 5). Feedback from the pilots should be used to update the selection matrix developed in Phase I and to develop training material and methodology in Task 14.</p>
<p><strong>Task 13:</strong> After the Phase II report is approved, conduct two pilot workshops to test the best tools identified during Phase I and developed during Phase II. Feedback from the pilots should be used to update the list of tools and the guidance framework.

Here is a printable version of the Liability Statement (<a href="http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/shrp2/LiabilityStatement.pdf">http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/shrp2/LiabilityStatement.pdf</a>). A free copy of the Adobe Acrobat PDF reader is available at <a href="http://www.adobe.com">http://www.adobe.com</a>. The Liability Statement is included as Figure 1 in the <em>Manual for Conducting Research and Preparing Proposals for SHRP 2</em> referred to in General Note 4.</p>
<p>
<p><strong>Special Notes</strong></p>
<p>1. The research for this project should include consideration of any related research by the SHRP 2 Capacity and Reliability focus areas. Examples include, but are not limited to, SHRP 2 projects C01, C07, and L04.</p>
<p>2. For Tasks 12 and 13 proposers should discuss their recommendations for the format, audience, and outline for the pilots.</p>
<p><strong>General Notes</strong></p>
<p>1. Proposals will be evaluated by SHRP 2 staff and Expert Task Groups (ETGs) consisting of individuals collectively very knowledgeable in the problem area. Selection of an agency is made by the SHRP 2 Oversight Committee, based on the recommendation from SHRP 2 staff and the ETG. The following factors are considered: (1) the proposer's demonstrated understanding of the problem; (2) the merit of the proposed research approach and experimental design; (3) the experience, qualifications, and objectivity of the research team in the same or closely related problem area; (4) the proposer's plan for participation by disadvantaged business enterprises (DBEs)-small firms owned and controlled by minorities or women; and (5) the adequacy of facilities.</p>
<p>TRB and the SHRP 2 Oversight Committee strongly encourage the significant participation of DBEs in SHRP 2 research contracts. Although no quota is specified nor is DBE participation mandated, the proposer's plan for involvement of DBEs is a factor in contractor selection, and the contractor's adherence to its DBE plan will be monitored during the contract period. Contractors are required to submit periodic reports comparing actual with proposed payments to DBEs. The "Contractor Expression of Interest" section of the SHRP 2 website is a resource for proposers interested in participating on research teams. This database is being enhanced and will be renamed the Research Team Builder.</p>
<p>2. Any clarifications regarding this RFP will be posted on the SHRP 2 Web site (<a href="http://www.TRB.org/SHRP2">www.TRB.org/SHRP2</a>). Announcements of such clarifications will be posted on the front page and, when possible, will be noted in the TRB e-newsletter. Proposers are advised to check the Web site frequently until March 26, 2009, when no further comments will be posted.</p>
<p>3. According to the provisions of Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 21, which relates to nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs, all parties are hereby notified that the contract entered into pursuant to this announcement will be awarded without discrimination on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or disability.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SHRP 2 Request for Proposals</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus Area:</strong> Capacity<br /><strong>Project Number:</strong> C19<br /><strong>Project Title:</strong> Add Expedited-Schedule Case Studies to the Collaborative Decision-Making Framework Data Base<br /><strong>Date Posted:</strong> March 10, 2009</p>
<p><strong>SHRP 2 Background<br /></strong>To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); improved travel time reliability through congestion reduction (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 will receive approximately $150 million with total program duration of 7 years. Additional information about SHRP 2 can be found on the program's Web site at <a href="http://www.trb.org/shrp2">www.trb.org/shrp2</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Capacity Focus Area</strong><br />The objective of the Capacity focus area is to produce approaches and tools for systematically integrating environmental, economic, and community requirements into the analysis, planning, and design of new highway capacity. That is being accomplished by developing a Collaborative Decision-Making Framework, organized around Key Decision Points, for reaching decisions on enhancing highway capacity and providing the tools for applying the framework. The framework is being implemented through a web-based portal that will provide structured access to the results of individual research projects.</p>
<p>The scope of the Capacity Focus Area, as defined by the SHRP 2 Oversight Committee, extends from the early stages of the transportation planning process when many potential solutions are being considered through project development. SHRP 2 is the Strategic Highway Research Program, but being strategic about highway capacity investments means full examination of highway design, transit, pedestrian, and non-motorized alternatives within the collaborative decision-making process.<br /><br />While not a hard and fast rule, the scope of the Capacity Focus Area ends roughly with a Record of Decision in the NEPA process. There is not necessarily a "standard" end to the planning, programming, and environmental review process but the scope of the Capacity Focus Area does not extend into design and construction. The expedited-schedule cases examined in C19 should not include accelerated design and construction techniques unless such activity is advanced in time and runs in parallel with planning, programming, or environmental review. The Renewal Focus Area of SHRP 2 is concerned with expediting design and construction, so it should not be included here.</p>
<p><strong>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>Linkage to Other SHRP 2 Projects</p>
<p>One of the fundamental products of the SHRP 2 Capacity research program will be the Collaborative Decision-Making Framework (CDMF). The objective of this framework is to develop a systems-based, transparent, well-defined framework for consistently reaching collaborative decisions on transportation capacity enhancements. The framework will address about 50 key decision points (KDPs) in six core transportation decision processes:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Systems planning <br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Pre-program studies (e.g., corridor studies)<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Programming <br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Environmental Review<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Design<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Permitting</p>
<p>A key decision point is one at which approvals and signoffs are required before the process can advance. SHRP 2 Project C01 is developing the framework and the results of other SHRP 2 Capacity projects, including C19, will be integrated into the framework, creating a unified product for users.</p>
<p>Under project C01 case studies were conducted in which collaboration aided project decision making and helped overcome difficulties. Additional case studies featured innovative solution screening strategies, the application of which also involved collaboration. Project C19 will add to this case study data base.</p>
<p>Under project C07, a web-based "portal" is being developed to organize access to the information collected under C01, C19, and selected other SHRP 2 Capacity projects. The project C19 research agency will work closely with the web-developer conducting C07 so that a seamless interface results. (See <a href="http://trb.org/shrp2/SHRPII_Capacity.asp">http://trb.org/shrp2/SHRPII_Capacity.asp</a> for background on work to date on the Collaborative Decision Making Framework.)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C19 Problem Statement</span></strong></p>
<p>The Collaborative Decision-Making Framework (CDMF) is the cornerstone product of the SHRP 2 Capacity program area. One of the more compelling reasons that DOTs and other transportation agencies may be interested in adopting the CDMF is that it could lead to expediting schedules for major capacity projects. The case studies already assembled under project C01 focus on the benefits of collaboration to correctly identify the nature of a transportation problem (which is often not what it seems) and find the best transportation, environmental, and community solutions. Successful collaboration can also support faster completion because there may be less opposition to the project if the collaboration process resolves many community and environmental issues early. The cases sought under this project should be consistent with the principles of collaborative decision making but also identify streamlining steps that can be taken within this context. This project will specifically address expediting the completion of the planning, programming, environmental review, and permitting steps for major capacity projects and may pave the way for expedited design and construction. Case studies will be used to understand how major projects have been delivered in a much shorter time frame than would have been possible without taking steps to expedite.</p>
<p>The lessons from expedited-schedule case studies will be compiled in a report and an electronic version of the cases will fit into the web-based tools being developed under project C07. The C07 Integration contractor will provide guidance on formats</p>
<p><strong>Project Objective</strong></p>
<p>Describe tools, techniques, and strategies to expedite delivery of highway capacity projects and programs of projects based on review of selected case studies. The results of this project will enhance the Collaborative Decision Making Framework.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong><br /><em>Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objective. Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time. Proposals must present the proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach to meet the research objective. <strong>In all tasks pursue innovations and best practices in collaborative decision making, process management, and resource management.</strong></em><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> Review and screen the relevant literature, awards, or recognition for rapid delivery of highway projects (FHWA, ASCE, AASHTO, and others), and other published case studies that address the project objective. Also, scan nonhighway cases for lessons learned on expedited schedule projects, e.g., railroads, stadiums, power plants, pipelines, and electric utilities. Include international examples as appropriate. Distill what is already known about the tools, techniques, and strategies used in the cases cited in the literature. As needed make follow-up contacts such as phone interviews to get additional details. Pursue new leads that may arise as you conduct the follow-ups. Assemble the information for analysis in Task 2.</p>
<p>Note: Cases should include but not be limited to projects funded only with state (or state plus private) funds, federal-aid projects, and fast-track projects in response to a disaster. Extract principles that can be applied systematically in business-as-usual situations, not techniques unique to disaster situations. <br /><br /><strong>Task 2:</strong> Based on Task 1, evaluate the effectiveness of tools, techniques, and strategies. Include impacts, short-term cost-effectiveness, long-term cost-effectiveness, and risks (including community opposition, law suit, or selection of suboptimal alternatives.) Identify the top 10-20 most effective tools and techniques for expediting project delivery and the circumstances in which they were or could be applied. Submit a Task 1 and 2 report to SHRP 2 for review.<br /><br />Note: In your proposal, clearly describe the evaluation method you plan to use. Consider that in expediting project delivery there is tension between budget and schedule. Frame such tradeoffs not only in absolute project cost and schedule (e.g., extra meetings, overtime, and incentive pay) but also how increased budget and schedule in early phases of project planning did (or might) might yield savings in later phases.</p>
<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Identify locations that have employed the top 10-20 tools, techniques, and strategies for expediting project delivery and prepare a site follow-up plan to fully develop case studies about the tools, techniques, and strategies. Prepare a Task 3 report for review by SHRP 2 that identifies the locations and tools, techniques, and strategies you plan to follow up in greater depth.</p>
<p><strong>Task 4:</strong> Following approval of the Task 3 Report, explore the tools, techniques, and strategies in each location in greater depth by interviewing a range of stakeholders (transportation agency staff, the public, resource agencies, elected officials) in locations where they have been applied. Expand the benefits and disadvantages, how to know when to use tools, how to apply combinations, and explore the business case. Where possible, link the tools, techniques, and strategies to Key Decision Points in the Collaborative Decision-Making Framework.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5:</strong> Prepare a draft final report that includes a detailed write-up on each tool and technique including an evaluation and variations in application. It should address the business case for applying these tools and techniques and provide guidance for implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Task 6:</strong> Consult with the contractor for SHRP 2 project C07 regarding electronic preparation of C19 material for inclusion in the Collaborative Decision Making Framework web portal.</p>
<p><strong>Task 7:</strong> Following review of the Draft Final Report, prepare a final report and amend electronic material as necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Deliverables </strong><br />&nbsp; 1. &nbsp;Task 1&amp;2 Report<br />&nbsp; 2. &nbsp;Task 3 Report<br />&nbsp; 3. &nbsp;Project Draft Final Report <br />&nbsp; 4. &nbsp;Project Final Report <br />&nbsp; 5. &nbsp;Electronic material&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; Two (2) interim meetings with SHRP 2 staff, one (1) in Washington, DC, and one (1) at the contractor's facility.<br />&nbsp; 7. &nbsp;Two (2) interim meetings with the Capacity Technical Coordinating Committee in Washington, DC; Irvine, CA; or Woods Hole, MA&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; 8. &nbsp;Telephone conference calls, as needed</p>
<p><strong>Special Notes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note 1:</strong> For the purposes of this RFP "expedited schedule" means completion of the planning, programming, environmental review, and permitting stages much faster than the agency norm. In cases using design build, operating in a special environment like an authority, or operating only with state and private funding the steps may be different. SHRP 2 is still interested in how it was done.</p>
<p><strong>Note 2:</strong> Research teams should include experience in the following areas: <br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Planning, programming, environmental review, and permitting of highway projects or programs of projects<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Accelerated public- and private-sector decision making on infrastructure projects<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Change management and organizational process management<br />&nbsp; &bull; &nbsp;Resource management and scheduling (avoid bottlenecks)</p>

Quotations may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation.

Vendors that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.<br />(c) Period for validity of quotations. The vendor agrees to establish a firm timeframe in which the proposed price is good for.<br />(d) Reserved<br />(e) Multiple quotations. Vendors are encouraged to submit multiple quotations presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each quotation submitted will be evaluated separately.<br />(f) Reserved<br />(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate quotations as described in FAR 13.106-2. Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government may accept other than the lowest quote; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received. <br />(h) Reserved<br />(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all quotations exceeding $3,000, and quotations of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The vendor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its quotation, the annotation ``DUNS'' or ``DUNS +4'' followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the vendor's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the vendor to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.

Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only.  The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary.  Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period.  The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both.  When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation.  A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided.  Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period.  To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option.  In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits.  The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period.  However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.

This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items.   These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed.   
 
2.  	The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated.  Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc.  The contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document or a DD Form 1348, entitled, Issue Release/Receipt Document.  A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator.  The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the contractor at time of award.  The contractor shall not take receipt of property that is not listed in the specification, has not been previously identified as becoming part of the contract (via contract modification) or which otherwise cannot be identified.  Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator. 

3. 	The contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, Government Property Report.   This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times.  All property described in paragraph 1 (a, and b) above shall be reported on the report.  At contract completion the contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed.  A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness.  The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all government property took over the course of the contract.   This completed report must accompany the contractor's final invoice.  Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received.  A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.
 
4.  	Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard.  This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.

CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT

The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer Representative (COR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report, Form MLCA(v)005-1.  The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved the Contracting Officer, to the COR.  The COR will comment on the contractors response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the contractor, MLC(vr), the NESU and Program Manager.  The Contracting Officer will make the final response to the contractor in writing.
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time-consuming litigation.
Potential quoters who believe that a Coast Guard solicitation is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the quoter should then contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the address below:
		Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)
		2100 Second Street, SW
		Washington, D.C. 20593
		Telephone (202)267-2285
		FAX:  (202)267-4011
Potential quoters should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response:  Solicitation number, Contracting Office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)

Base year contract begins April 2009 thru April 2010 with the option for four additional one-year periods.

The details of the recycle plan shall include the facility location and the recycle process described in a detailed narrative with any needed illustrations, pictures or video to allow for a full understanding of the offerors recycle process.  Estimated turn around recycle time lines should be included in the offerors recycle plan.  The recycle plan described in detail will be forwarded to this agency must be included with all offerors submissions for award consideration.  Submitting a recycle plan does not guarantee technical acceptability.  

1. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will make the determination if a proposed recycle plan from the offeror submitting the RFP is legitimate. Any recycle program that is not deemed as legitimate by the EPA will not be considered technically acceptable and thereby removed from consideration for award.

2. The offeror will separately list each drum and the weight of each drum collected on the hazardous waste manifest and on the bill of lading.  The offeror must transport all spent media to their off-base designated recycling facility.  The recycling facility must forward the bill of lading from each container that has completed the recycle process to include the facility disposition report to the Waste Minimization Managers office under the Environmental Division at FT Riley of whom will compare recycled material reports with spent material leaving FT Riley.  This will be done to ensure the amount of spent media leaving FT Riley RSMS is equal to the spent media being recycled.  A second copy of these documents shall be sent to the KS RSMS for recordkeeping purposes.

3. The recycle process for the spent media must be recycled within the Continental United States and may not be sent for recycle outside of the US. The recycle program of the awarded company will be subject to audit without notice throughout the entire performance of the contract.

MISSION/FLIGHT PARAMETERS AND SPECIFIC TASKS. The following mission/flight operating tasks, or parameters, are typical of the Air Support Services the contractor shall be expected to perform under the contract. The contractor shall note this is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of Air Support Service operations. It also is not intended as an absolute definition of each mission/flight parameters relative to each iteration conducted. In fact, mission/flight parameters shall be tailored, by an authorized Government representative, for each iteration scheduled, to meet USASOC mission needs, and as such, may differ in detail from those that follow. 1.5.4.1 Air Support Services consist mostly of three general types of operations. 1) High Altitude Low Opening Parachute Technique (HALO), which will generally require the contractor to operate between a minimum altitude of 4,000 feet above ground level and a maximum altitude of 12,500 feet above ground level for para-drop operations. Para-drops from this altitude are generally free-fall style of operations, with parachute deployment triggered by the jumper or an automatic opening device, but at times the PIO may require an aircraft rigged for static line HALO para-drops. 2) Static Line Parachute Technique (SL), which generally requires the contractor to operate between 800 feet above ground level and 1,500 feet above ground level for para-drop operations. Para-drop operations from this altitude will be static line drops and require the aircraft to be rigged for static line drop operations from either a side door or a rear ramp. Some cargo drops such as the Robin Sage Re-supply Bundle Drops require parachute rigged bundles/cargo to be dropped on a drop zone from an altitude of 500 feet above ground level. 3) Landing Zone Operations (LZ), which consist of aircraft landing and taking off from various small field landing strips for the purpose of discharging and picking up both passengers and cargo for transport to other mission locations and/or for return to the designated home airfield of the operation. Small field landing strips shall be both improved dirt and hardtop. This narrative does not represent all encompassing description of static constraint conditions in the operational environment and it is the contractor's responsibility to ensure a proper reconnaissance of actual operational conditions is conducted before each and every scheduled mission and that any flight safety issues based on the results are immediately made known to the COR and the Contracting Officer. . Air Support Service operations at the National Training Center (NTC), Fort Irwin, California, if scheduled may require all three types of Air Support Services. All mission profiles/parameters for providing Air Support Services at the NTC will be given to the contractor's program manager a minimum of five (5) days prior to required mission execution for planning and coordination with the using customer. 1.5.4.2 The side door or rear ramp of the aircraft used for Air Support Services shall allow ease of exit from the aircraft of a fully combat equipped paratrooper or dropped cargo as described in paragraph 1.6 of this PWS. Current Air Support Services for Fort Bragg missions are presently accomplished with a CASA 212 aircraft. All three types of Air Support Operations shall be conducted under both daylight and dark (daytime and nighttime) conditions. Unless otherwise instructed by authorized Government personnel as designated by the contracting officer, the pilot will turn on aircraft landing lights just prior to the beginning of initiating a drop and leave them on through the completion of para-drop operations across the drop zone, before shutting them off to assume a normal flight profile. All Landing Zones will be marked for landing by Government personnel and all landing zone operations will be conducted using aircraft landing lights. The contractor will ensure that all Air Service Support aircraft used has the capability to communicate with the Ground Party running the operation via approved VHF and/or UHF frequencies. <br />1.5.5.Air Operations Practical Exercises (AOPE).

For HALO operations dropping paratroopers, the aircraft shall be configured to allow a military free fall exit of the aircraft through either a side door or a ramp so as to support the ease of exit of combat equipped jumpers. For Static Line operations dropping paratroopers, the aircraft will be rigged with a static line as described in paragraph 6 of the PWS as to allow military static line airborne exit of the aircraft through either a side door or a rear ramp. For landing zone operations, the aircraft will be setup in-accordance-with mission requirements established in the pre-mission "close-on" coordination briefing with a designated Government representative from the using customer. The estimated time to complete this operation is seven hours. <br />1.5.5.1 Practice Airborne Infiltration Operations (PAIO). PAIO operations shall incorporate aircraft that have a minimum of 16 seats installed (approved side fold-up seats), rigged for Static Line para-operations, with an allowable cabin load capable for transporting fourteen (14) combat equipped jumpers per mission/flight iteration. PAIO missions can have as many as 150-200 total jumpers. The contractor can expect to carry on average between 10 and 15 lifts in a four to five hour period. For planning purposes, each of these missions will require the aircraft to fly a minimum of 30 minutes between the time instructor/jump master personnel can unfasten their seat belt and begin on-board jump preparations and the time the aircraft is in position for the first jumper to exit the aircraft. The aircraft must be able to complete a minimum of two complete lifts and jumps prior to requiring a refueling. The time between multiple drops at one site can be between 10 to 40 minutes. This operation is normally conducted during nighttime. Pilots flying this operation shall brief the flight routes to personnel that will be jumping. The estimated time to complete this operation is seven hours. 1.5.5.2. Robin Sage Airborne Infiltration Operations (RSAIO). Every effort will be made to utilize military aircraft for the RSAIO mission; however, in the event that military aircraft are not available, the contractor shall provide Air Support Services, to include, providing aircraft fully capable of supporting RSAIO requirements.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FA8202-09-R-1000<br />A-10 European and Pacific In-theater Depots<br />Draft RFP and Pre-Proposal Conference</strong></p>
<p>The A-10 System Program Office (SPO) hereby posts the attached draft RFP for industry consideration and would also like to announce a pre-proposal conference to discuss the United States Air Force requirement for in-theater contract depot repair support for A-10 aircraft based overseas at Spangdahlem AB, Germany (USAFE) and Osan AB, Republic of South Korea (PACAF). The A-10 SPO is interested in meeting with industry representatives to answer questions and receive feedback regarding this requirement to assist with acquisition planning and program strategy.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br />There are two separate contracts associated with this Pre-Proposal Conference. For each region of operation, Europe and the Republic of South Korea, the U.S Government intends to make a single award to a technically responsive source with a 5-year Requirements type contract. The estimated workload is 3-6 aircraft inductions per fiscal year for SLEP/SSI plus occasional drop-in maintenance and Contract Field Team deployments as necessary. Future aircraft modification programs may also be a requirement for these contracts. Best Estimated Quantities are included in the attached RFP. Please note that although Precision Engagement modifications will be included as a requirement for PACAF, this will be an optional CLIN. As of this time, the USAF has not made a final decision on whether to accomplish PE at the in-theater contract depot.</p>
<p>In order to be considered for this workload, a qualified offeror must operate the proposed depot maintenance facility within unrefueled A-10 flight range (400 Nautical Miles) of the respective A-10 operating location (Spangdahlem or Osan AB).</p>
<p><strong>Draft RFP</strong></p>
<p><br />The attached draft RFP is being included for industry comment/consideration and IS NOT a formal Request for Proposal. The government seeks industry feedback on all aspects of this draft solicitation including the PWS. In addition, the government is seeking input on the following items of interest:<br />1. The number of flow days the contractors feel that each FFP task will require as set forth in Section B. <br />2. The feasibility of providing past performance that meets the relevancy criteria in Section M, para 2.1.2.<br />3. The clarity of technical evaluation subfactors in Section M, para 2.4 - 2.6.<br />4. The clarity of Section L, Instructions to Offeror</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please provide written comments on the draft RFP by 1600 MST 13 Mar 2009.</span></strong></p>
<p>Not all portions of the draft-RFP are being posted at this time. Updates/additions will be posted when and if they become available. Please check FBO often for updates.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Proposal Conference</strong></p>
<p>1. The purpose of this conference is to provide open dialogue between government and industry in response to the draft RFP. In order for this to be an effective exchange, the government requests a list of agenda topics and specific questions that industry would like the Government to address. The Government does not intend to present additional information beyond what has been made available in the draft RFP and previous FBO postings. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please submit your agenda topic recommendations and specific questions to the industry day POC not later than 13 March 2009.</span></strong> Early submissions are encouraged.</p>
<p><br />2. At this time the government does not intend to limit the number of representatives attending from each contractor's firm. However, depending on responses from industry, the government may be forced to impose limits due to room capacity.</p>
<p><br />3. In order to attend Industry Day, each contractor must provide the following for each attendee:</p>
<p><br />a. Name, address and CAGE code of firm<br />b. Indicate status of company - Small Business or Large Business<br />c.

<p><br />4. If time permits, one-on-one sessions may be offered on 17 March after the open sessions. These sessions will be coordinated at the conclusion of the open session.</p>
<p><br />5. An optional tour of the Ogden Air Logistics Center A-10 Depot Repair Line is being considered. Please indicate your interest in attending a tour and the names of attendees by <strong>13 Mar 2009</strong>. Note: this tour will be identical to the tour given at the Nov 2008 industry day.

<DESC><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This request is an announcement for information for planning purposes only. This announcement supercedes all previous posts. Interested sources should resubmit to the information contained in this announcement. This sources sought does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Request for Quote, or Invitation for Bid. Nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government's acquisition approach.</p>
<p>The Air Force Technical Application Center (AFTAC) is seeking interested sources for providing Operations Support for the US National Data Center (US NDC) program. The US NDC is the geophysical data acquisition, data processing, reporting and archiving component of the United States Atomic Energy Detection System (USAEDS) operated by the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC). AFTAC's mission is to monitor compliance with nuclear test ban treaties to standards set by US verification and policy leaders. This mission requires the US NDC to detect, locate and identify foreign nuclear tests and provide rapid reporting and technical assessment to the appropriate national security agencies and policy makers. The US NDC processes and integrates data and information up to and including the Department of Defense (DoD) SECRET level. The US NDC also serves as the data distribution center for all US government and authorized users for International Monitoring System (IMS) data. The focus of this effort is to fine-tune the current system by optimization of software algorithms through Scientific and Engineering studies, upgrade existing hardware, and sustain the present operational systems.</p>
<p>The US NDC is an advanced geophysical data acquisition and processing system which provides the capability to receive, process, archive and report events of interest in monitoring nuclear treaty requirements. It acquires waveform data from a global network of seismic, hydroacoustic and infrasonic stations. Data is stored, distributed to researchers both internal and external to AFTAC, and reliably forwarded to a classified processing system. The US NDC receives data from the International Data Center (IDC) originating from International Monitoring System (IMS) sensors on U.S. territory and from other countries. Users interactively review, refine, correct, and display currently available results.<br />The US NDC consists of the following components: (a) A 24x7 operations center located in the AFTAC Operations Center (AOC), Patrick AFB, FL (PAFB); (b) A 24x7 alternate (ALT) hot-backup system located at Goodfellow AFB, TX (GAFB); (c) A Training System located at the 312th Training Squadron GAFB; (d) A Remote Operations Center (ROC) located at PAFB (used to support unplanned and/or short term AOC outages, fire drills, etc.); (e) The US NDC Sustainment System (SUS, aka the test-bed) and (f) the US NDC Development System (DEVL), both located at AFTAC/PAFB.</p>
<p>Current System Parameters include the following:<br />1) Hardware: SUN SPARC-based servers and workstations, Storage area network drives, LTO3 tape archives<br />2) Software: Solaris 8 &amp; 10, Oracle 10g, ClearQuest/ClearCase, Tuxedo, Net Vault, Trusted Gateway System<br />3) Code: C, C++, FORTRAN, PERL, Scheme, SQL, Lisp, ASM, CSH, Java, Makefile, SH, TCL, YACC</p>
<p>The operational US NDC hardware (OPS, Alt, Training System, and Remote Operations Center) along with most of the development/sustainment hardware is and will continue to be maintained through a separate AFTAC maintenance support contract.</p>
<p>Contractor responsibility will include the sustainment and integration of a total system including correction and implementation of fixes to software problems, on-going software and hardware upgrades, and advanced/on-going tuning/optimization of software algorithms. All personnel must have a Secret clearance and all key personnel must have a Top Secret (SCI) clearance. A majority of the work will be done within the AFTAC building at Patrick AFB, FL. Therefore, the contractor must have or establish a facility in Florida and have key personnel available to work within AFTAC.</p>
<p>Examples of ongoing US NDC sustainment items include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>1) One of the primary objectives of this effort is to sustain a software and hardware architecture to include complete configuration management which will provide the platform for future system growth and enhancements. The functionality shall maintain and enhance existing data acquisition, detection, association, location, magnitude/yield estimation, event classification, event reporting, data distribution, and data archiving capabilities to meet current and future treaty monitoring needs as specified in the US NDC System Requirements Document (SRD).</p>
<p>2) Integration of 3rd party efforts: The Department of Energy (DoE) and Air Force labs, as well as various government contractors are involved in numerous areas of US NDC development. Some examples are: portions of the knowledge base, event classification methodology, and Geographical Information System (GIS). It will be the contractor's responsibility to team with these AFTAC partners and integrate their products.</p>
<p>3) The US NDC contractor is responsible for providing Total System Integration Responsibility (TSIR) for the US NDC. The US NDC contractor is responsible for integration of hardware, COTS/GOTS software and calibration information, and contractor developed software into the US NDC system.</p>
<p>4) The US NDC contractor is responsible for providing 24x7 on call support to insure 99% operational availability rate.</p>
<p>5) The US NDC contractor participates as a key member of the US NDC Change Management Board (CMB) to insure the US NDC will continue to meet the operational availability requirements. The CMB oversees the US NDC Change Request (CR) process and prioritizes O&amp;M work which includes but is not limited to software bug fixes and minor enhancements, adding new stations to data acquisition and both station and network processing.</p>
<p>6) Studies</p>
<p>a) Conduct engineering/scientific studies to help optimize/tune detection, association, location, magnitude/yield estimation and event classification to meet current and future treaty monitoring needs.</p>
<p>b) Conduct engineering and IT infrastructure studies (e.g., hardware, software, databases) to help improve overall system performance and help reduce maintenance costs and man power needs.</p>
<p>All applicable upgrades to the US NDC shall also be made to the training system and to the Alt US NDC, both of which are located at Goodfellow AFB TX.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. It is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources. The estimated contract cost for this effort is approximately $10M - $15M and is anticipated to be a 3-year contract (basic with two 1-year options.

<DESC><p>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS: This synopsis is for the purpose of obtaining market research only. NO PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED OR ACCEPTED UNDER THIS SYNOSPIS OR UNDER THIS SOLICITATION NUMBER. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow-up information requests. The US Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District, will use information obtained under this synopsis to develop an acquisition strategy to meet the Air Force Lackland Airman Training Campus mission primarily but may include other projects at Lackland AFB and in the San Antonio area. The intent of this synopsis is to access industrys small business concerns (including 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)) capable and interested in providing various construction support, to include potential Design-Build capabilities, to the Air Force Airman Training Complex (ATC) North Campus at Lackland AFB, San Antonio, Texas. The construction program need is estimated to be approximately $400 Million over the next five years. The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code related to this program is 236220, Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million. It is anticipated that the ATC Program need may be met through the use of either a single or a multiple award process to establish various Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Single Award Task Order Contracts (SATOCs) or Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs). The single award approach results in the establishment of a single qualified, dedicated contractor. The multiple award approach results in the establishment of qualified pool of contractors (each pool may have 3 to 5 firms) that may compete under the specific awarded IDIQ MATOC to provide the required services. It is anticipated that a total of one SATOC or one MATOC may be awarded to support the ATC Program. Each SATOC or MATOC will include a minimum order limitation that is anticipated to be $5 million and a maximum order limitation that is anticipated to range from $70-80 Million. The Government is seeking qualified, experienced and reliable sources capable of providing simultaneous delivery of various construction tasks, materials and/or supplies needed to support the ATC projects. These projects are all located on Lackland AFB. An example of an anticipated typical delivery order is: Construct a four-level multi-wing 227,000 SF recruit dormitory to include all associated support equipment and utilities. The standard period anticipated for most jobs will range from 1-2 year(s), potentially, from receipt of the delivery order. Large multiple deliveries may be staggered to accommodate mission requirements. CAPABILITY NARRATIVE: Firms interested in responding to this synopsis are required to submit the following information: (1) Company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, fax number, email address, and Business Size (e.g., large, small, other). Identify the small business socio-economic size standard size (8(a), HUBZone and/or SDVOSB) and include identification of your Small Business Administration District Office; (2) Provide a narrative to describe your firms recent and relative construction experience and past performance in delivering same/similar requirements; recent and relevant experience with federal government work preferred, as described above to meet the Air Force need; (3) Provide a narrative to identify which SBA identified region(s) your firm is capable and interested in providing the required supplies. Include in your narrative the maximum contract amount your firm is capable of providing and rather or not your firm can provide the anticipated maximum order limitation of $80 Million, and if so maximum bonding capacity upwards of $400+Million; (4) Provide a listing of the services your firm is capable of providing in-house to include staff size and listing of support sub-contractors and their size; (5) Provide a listing of your network suppliers/subcontractors that you anticipate using to meet the need; (6) Provide a narrative to describe any industry concerns/constraints regarding the ability to execute this program; (7) provide recent and relevant Design-Build construction experience for projects of similar size, scope, and complexity, to include method of accomplishing design (registered engineering firms).
