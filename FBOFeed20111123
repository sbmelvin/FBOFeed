<DESC><p>F-15C Mission Training Center (MTC): FA8621-11-R-6257. This is a pre-solicitation synopsis. The Aeronautical System Center (ASC), Agile Combat Support Systems Directorate, Simulator Division (ASC/WNS) intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to The Boeing Company, Training and Simulation Services (TSS) to provide additional years of F-15C Training and Simulation Services. The intent of this notice is not to request competitive proposals. <br /><br />The proposed contract will include services to provide F-15C pilots real-time mission training capability at 3 MTCs for ACC, USAFE, and PACAF. In addition to the training services, the contract will include training capability upgrades and associated change management for all existing MTCs to maintain concurrency with the aircraft baseline and updates to the standards for Combat Air Forces Distributed Mission Operations network. <br /><br />The government intends to award pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 since award to any company other than The Boeing Company TSS would result in unacceptable delays and substantial duplication of costs. Delays would consist of time required to field, integrate, and certify new F-15C high-fidelity simulation systems. Providing a fully functional capability would take considerable time for a non-incumbent service provider. Delays like this result in a high risk of degraded training and pilot preparedness, both of which are unacceptable. Furthermore, costs for a 5 year contract would be substantially higher for a new service provider such as costs to start up, develop, and test simulator systems which all would result in a duplication of costs already incurred by the incumbent. Overall, an award to the incumbent will secure cost-effective continuous full operating capability at each required site. <br /><br />Interested offerors must submit within 15 calendar days from the publication date of this notice, their capability package describing the company's technical expertise and experience, personnel and facilities, and motivation for participating in this program. Responses should be sent to ASC/WNSK, 2300 D Street, Wright Patterson AFB OH 45433, Attn: Amanda Thompson, email Amanda.Thomspon@wpafb.af.mil. The Contracting Officer is John Huber, 937-255-3801, email John.Huber@wpafb.af.mil. <br /><br />For subcontracting opportunities, interested parties may submit appropriate information via email to George Harms at 314-777-9872, or george.e.harms@boeing.com at The Boeing Company TSS, St. Louis MO. <br /><br />The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement action is 541511. Please indicate the number of employees relative to the size standard of $25,000,000.00 in revenue for determination for small business status. Responses shall include their DUNS number and their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code. <br /><br />An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. As stated in 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman:</p>
<p>An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. <br />(a) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).<br />(b) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) ombudsman:<br />Howard E. Marks Jr.<br />Chief, Acquisition Center of Excellence<br />Aeronautical Systems Center<br />1755 11th St, Bldg 570, Room 101<br />Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7404<br />howard.marks@wpafb.af.mil<br />Voice Number: 937-255-8642 (DSN 785-8642) Fax Number: 937-656-7193 (DSN 986-7193)<br />Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU or ARISRA level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.<br />(c) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. <br />(d) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.

The Contractor shall perform the following tasks independently, but under Public Affairs supervision, direction, and control:<br><br>a.	The contractor must provide photographers who can immediately undertake 	 the management, administration, and technical services of the photography required for performance within the MCoE Public Affairs Office at Fort Benning.    <br><br>b.	All photographers employed by the Contractor to perform services under this contract agreement, should have at least three (3) years of professional photography experience and should be knowledgeable in the use and application of Adobe for photographers, Photo Shop, and Freehand. Photographers would have such assigned tasks as taking group photos of visiting dignitaries and adding the command logo and visit information to the image before printing copies for presentation, or going up in a helicopter to photograph the commanding general or other VIPs and capturing the best images from the Maneuver Conference or the Best Ranger Competition, where time is of the essence and he/she must move from place to place quickly.  The photographer will be relied on at times to help out with selection, in capturing the correct shot for publication. <br><br>1.  VIP visits can require total coverage from the beginning to the end of the visit.  On average, there are between 4 and 6 of these events each month.  During these events, not only will the contractor be required to provide dedicated photo coverage for the visiting dignitary, he/she will also be required to cover mission-related events of a routine and special nature simultaneously.  <br><br>2.  Often, the contractor will be required to print a selection of images for VIPs prior to their departure.  Photo coverage must be able to continue while these office duties are taking place. The contractor is required to keep a professional archive of all images produced on the online photo site, www.FortBenningPhotos.com - which includes the appropriate cutline information for each photograph.  <br><br>c.	The contractor will photograph installation events with high command priority including, but not limited to, presentations, meetings with news-makers, general officer visits, training events, environmental and other activities that support command priorities and mission.<br>	<br>	1.  The contractor is required to cover between 18 and 22 events of this nature per 		month.  These events can be scheduled or last-minute in nature, so the contractor 	must be prepared to provide simultaneous coverage in the event of multiple 	activities conflicting.  The contractor is required to archive all photos from events covered online, including a detailed cutline for each image uploaded to the photo site.<br><br>2.  The contractor is required to take group photos, which will often involve set up of lights and other photographic equipment.  There are between 8 and 12 requirements for group photos per month and the contractor must maintain the ability to cover events that may be scheduled during these group photos.	<br><br>d.	The Contractor must be responsible for providing management and guidance related to capturing critical photographs in various environments and situations while also organizing and archiving past/present and future photographs. During assignments, photographers must work independently of any direct supervision and with extreme discretion due the sensitive nature of the events to be captured. <br><br>e.	The contractor will provide cutline information for each photo taken including, but not limited to, name and contact information of any photographed individuals, locations and event information, including date and a detailed description of what's taking place in the photograph.  AP Style cutlines (minus the contact info) will be uploaded to the online archive with their corresponding image. <br><br>f.	The contractor is required to keep a professional archive of all images produced on the online photo site, www.FortBenningPhotos.com.  The contractor will make digital duplication of photographs for distribution as necessary and deliver to appropriate outlets/individuals in a timely manner.<br><br>g.	The contractor is charged with increasing positive awareness and appreciation of Fort Benning by seamlessly integrating and promoting command photography with various websites and social media outlets.   The contractor will provide photo support including, but not limited to, photo searches, photo editing and photo graphics to all Public Affairs products including The Bayonet, Fort Benning TV, Tip of the Bayonet Newsletter, www.FortBenningPhotos.com, the Fort Benning Social Media network and any Strategic Communication project including, but not limited to, posters and brochures. <br><br>h.	The contractor will serve as technical engineer for all assigned equipment and maintain equipment as needed.<br><br>i.	The contractor shall provide a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week emergency telephone number to provide immediate photography coverage or assistance as needed.<br><br>j.	The contractor, at no cost to the government, shall replace any equipment due to loss, negligence, or damage.<br><br>k.	The contractor must be able to work in various environments to include wooded areas, uneven terrains, and heights and may be required to shoot photos and video from a military aircraft.  Strenuous physical activity is often involved in covering Fort Benning events.  Contractor must be able to wear a military helmet and body armor that can weigh up to 40 pounds while covering some training events.   Hearing protection will be provided by the government during activities involving gunfire. <br><br>l.	The contractor must provide uninterrupted performance of the designated services which are known for such a position within the department of labor guidelines, however, due to the diversity of events, assignments, and command schedules, he/she will stand ready to support, regardless of location (in or out of state), weather (cold and hot outdoor/indoor temperatures), or complexity (possibly the need to pull additional photographers in to support special events). <br><br> <br>REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBMISSION OF INVOICES<br><br>C.6.1 Invoicing Schedule. Contractor shall establish billing cycle for all services provided under this contract, which runs from the 1st through the last day of the month. The contactor shall submit a monthly invoice for services used during the previous month's billing cycle, listing hours worked, services provided, mileage driven to assignments and products produced using the procedures indicated below to reach the Public Affairs Sub-Account no later than ten business days after the 1st day of the month.<br><br>C.7  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.<br><br>a.

<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents the intent to modify services provided by Noridian Administrative Services (NAS) under contract number HHSM-500-2006-M0005Z authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.<br /><br />The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals. <br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011. <br /><br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).

<DESC><strong>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.<br /><br /></span></strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) intends to issue a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotations (RFIAQ) for the standardization of <strong>Pad_Antiseptic_Skin_Prep_Alcohol on or about January 1, 2012,</strong> but the actual issue date for this RFIAQ may be delayed up to forty-five (45) business days.<br /><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements, plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <br /><br />Examples of items being solicited could include, but are not limited to Pad antiseptic Skin Prep Alcohol: sterile and non-sterile, nonwoven, latex free/safe, 70% isopropyl alcohol and 2-ply and other items. The estimated value of the resultant Incentive Agreement (IA) will be approximately $520,342 annually. <br /><br />NOTE: This initiative will be part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program which is executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel and standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. To participate in this Standardization Action (SA) your company<strong> </strong>must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor, or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA and a separate commercial agreement with Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from the solicitation is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. Vendor must update their DAPA numbers for this product line in the DAPA Management System with the country from which each line item is an end product, IAW the Trade Agreements Act. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendors responding to the solicitation will be required to ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country.<br /></span></strong>Detailed information about the requirements and selection process will be provided in the RFIAQ. The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the RFIAQ is imminent. Upon issuance of the RFIAQ, all solicitation information will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website. <br />

<DESC>NASA Glenn Research Center has a requirement for the performance of RamanSpectroscopy Measurements to obtain quantitative species and temperature measurementsusing the Frame Transfer Gating Raman Spectroscopy Technique that will be performed atrealistic conditions in a high pressure laboratory burner.  The Frame Transfer GatingRaman Spectroscopy Technique is jointly being developed by OAI and NASA researchers.  Time (up to 10 Hz) and spatially resolved quantitative measurements of major speciesconcentrations and temperature will be obtained in a laboratory burner operated in theNASA SE-5 facility using both gaseous and liquid fuels in a series of experiments.  Themeasurements obtained using the Raman Spectroscopy Technique will be utilized to validatecurrent research to develop advanced combustion CFD modeling tools.  Work will also beperformed to extend the Frame Transfer Gating Raman Spectroscopy measurement technique tomuch higher temporal frequencies in order to obtain better resolution in themeasurements.NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal(RFP) to Ohio Aerospace Institute (OAI).  Pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(B)(1), the acquisitionof the reference services are determined to be available from only one source.The estimated period of performance for this fixed price contract is twelve and a halfmonths from December 16, 2011 to December 31, 2012.  OAI is the only organizationcurrently qualified to perform the subject requirement for the following reasons:  1)  Apatent application has been filed for the unique Frame Transfer Gating SpectroscopyMeasurement Technique, which is jointly being developed by OAI and NASA researchers andwill be employed to make the required experimental measurements.  2) This technique iscritical for achieving the measurement sensitivity (background noise rejection) requiredfor combustion code validation of high pressure flames.  3)  The technique is in thefinal crucial stages of its development, and it is imperative that the same OAIresearcher who co-invented it and who worked on its development be allowed to finish thatdevelopment.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.Organizations who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impactto the program schedules supported by this work should fully identify their interest andcapabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Interested organizationsmay submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to theidentified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 8, 2011. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination bythe Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis,based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Each box contains 203reflector shells to reflect x-rays and focus onto a focal plane detector. The housing isvery complicated and requires very accurate machining process, because the housingaccuracy directly impacts the SXT optical performance. The housing dimension is reliedupon when the eight housing boxes are put together. If the housing dimension is notaccurate enough, it would result in miss-alignment of the reflectors, causing distortionof the housing. This distortion will directly affect the SXT image quality, which iscrucial for the project science goal. Thus, it is imperative the fabricated housing meetsthe required accuracy in the drawing, regardless of the complicated housing design. Therequired lead time is 12-16 weeks to meet the project schedule.(PLEASE NOTE SPECIFICATIONS WILL BE ATTACHED)NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from NORMAN NOBEL, INC. pursuant to FAR 13.106,for the acquisiton of supplies or services determined to be reasobalby available fromonly one source.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<CONTACT>HERMA BANKS, Email herma.banks@bsee.gov
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This pre-solicitation notice is being issued in accordance with FAR Part 5.204. This procurement is not a Small Business Set-Aside and is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), intends to competitively award a contract for a project entitled &iquest;Operation and Maintenance of Ohmsett, the National Oil Spill Response Research and Renewable Energy Test Facility.&iquest; The BSEE Acquisition Operations Branch is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administrator. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts. The Government intends to award a Hybrid Contract with a Firm-Fixed-Price component for the Operation and Maintenance of Ohmsett, and an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) component that provides for the issuance of both Time &amp; Materials (T&amp;M) and Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) orders for specific testing projects, training projects, facility upgrades and major unbudgeted repairs under separate task orders for the effort described herein but, may consider other proposed types if determined appropriate. The applicable NAICS Code is 561210, &iquest;Facilities Support Services.&iquest; The period of performance of the resultant contract is anticipated to be a Base Period of 12 Months and four (4) 12 Month Option Periods with an anticipated total of 60 months, if all options are exercised. BACKGROUND: The Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), is seeking contractor support personnel, materials, supplies, (except as furnished by the government) and services to operate and maintain Ohmsett, the National Oil Spill Response Research and Renewable Energy Test Facility. Ohmsett is located in Leonardo, New Jersey, on the grounds of Naval Weapons Station Earle (NWSE). Ohmsett is the only facility in the world where clients can conduct full-scale oil-spill response equipment tests with a variety of crude oils and refined petroleum products. The tests are conducted under controlled, reproducible conditions using standard test protocols that are, or will soon be, accepted and published by the American Society for Testing and Materials. Ohmsett provides a unique facility to conduct tests and develop new devices and techniques that detect, map, contain, and clean up oil spills, and various other marine equipment including renewable energy devices. Ohmsett is also a training facility. Ohmsett offers &iquest;hands on&iquest; training classes up to six times a year in oil spill response, confined space entry and viscous oil pumping techniques. Ohmsett also has specialized testing equipment/systems to: (1) evaluate fire resistant containment boom using a propane burner system; (2) test and evaluate dispersant effectiveness; (3) simulate cold water/broken ice conditions for equipment testing, training and research; (4) create different wave types to create realistic sea environments. The Ohmsett facility was constructed in the early 1970&iquest;s by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a joint endeavor with the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG). Ohmsett is an acronym for Oil and Hazardous Materials Simulated Environmental Test Tank. From 1974-1987, the facility was used extensively by US and Canadian Federal agencies to test a wide range of spill control equipment and systems including oil containment booms, skimmers, sorbents, chemical dispersants and in situ burning techniques. Interest in oil spill response technology waned in the late 1980&iquest;s and EPA closed Ohmsett in September 1988 and transferred the facility, buildings and equipment to the U.S. Navy (USN). The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA-90) mandated reactivation of Ohmsett and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) was given this responsibility. In April 1990, BSEE initiated restoration of Ohmsett by signing a use agreement with the USN. BSEE with financial support from the USCG and Environment Canada funded an extensive restoration process. Ohmsett became operational in July 1992. Because the mission of BSEE is focused on regulation, offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production, the current testing is limited to oil rather than hazardous materials. Consequently, Ohmsett is now formally known as Ohmsett &iquest; The National Oil Spill Response and Renewable Energy Test Facility. Today the facility is operated as a government owned, contractor operated facility, and is available for testing, training and research by government, industry and academia. The primary feature of the facility is a pile-supported, concrete tank 203 meters (667 feet) long by 20 meters (65 feet) wide and with a water depth of 2.4 meters (8 feet). The tank is filled with 9.84 million liters of crystal clear water maintained at open ocean salinity through periodic addition of salt. The tank has three movable, cable-drawn tow bridges operated by large electric motors. The tow bridges move on rails along the length of the tank and are capable of towing floating test equipment at variable speeds up to 3.3 meters/second (6.5 knots) for at least 40 seconds. The main tow bridge is equipped to lay oil on the surface of the water several meters ahead of the equipment being tested, so that reproducible thicknesses and widths of test oils are achievable with minimum wind interference. Underwater viewing of testing is accomplished through view ports on the side of the tank as well as underwater video cameras. The principle systems of the tank include a wave generator, an artificial beach to dampen waves, an oil water separator, a chlorination system and a filter system. The wave generator and artificial beach have the capability to produce regular waves up to 0.6 meters (2 feet) high and up to 45 meters (147 feet) long, as well as a series of 0.7 meter (2.3 feet) high reflected waves. Further information on the Ohmsett facility and procurement information can be found at http://ohmsettcontractcompetition.bsee.gov. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROCUREMENT INCLUDE: 1. Operate and maintain Ohmsett as an environmentally and physically safe and secure facility, capable of performing routine testing and training on a year round basis. 2. Conduct detailed research and development tests and evaluations of oil-spill response, renewable energy and other equipment and technology as required by the BSEE or outside clients. 3. Conduct oil spill response, and other training as required for BSEE and outside clients. During the past 10 years, these training sessions have occurred approximately six times a year. 4. Recommend engineering design changes to improve the performance of oil spill response equipment and make necessary changes as required by the BSEE or outside clients. 5. Maintain and repair oil spill response equipment stored at the Ohmsett facility as required by BSEE or the U.S. Coast Guard or other similar equipment identified by BSEE or outside clients. 6. Produce high quality technical reports on the results of tests and evaluations, training conducted, and operation and maintenance of the facility for a variety of clients in a timely fashion. These reports should be submitted to BSEE or the outside client, as appropriate, in electronic format via e-mail to the maximum extent practicable. 7. Actively participate in marketing efforts to attract and retain clients who utilize the Ohmsett facility. 8. Operate and maintain a web site similar to the one at www.ohmsett.com.

<SUBJECT>Request for Submission under Advanced Technology Innovation (ATI) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) HQ0147-11-ATI-BAA for Supplemental Information on Airborne Weapons Layer for the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS)
<SOLNBR>HQ0147-12-R-AWLR
<RESPDATE>011612
<CONTACT>Janice S Olson, Phone 256-450-4330, Email janice.olson@mda.mil
<DESC><br />1. Background. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is responsible for developing an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), integrating land, sea, air, and space based assets to defend the United States, friends and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attack. The Department of the Air Force is responsible for organizing, training, equipping, and providing forces to conduct offensive and defensive operations, to include appropriate air and missile defense, to gain and maintain air superiority, and air supremacy as required to enable the conduct of operations by U.S. and allied land, sea, air, space, and special operations forces.
<p>2. Description.</p>
<p>A. Submissions under ATI BAA with Supplemental Information. This announcement requests submissions under BAA HQ0147-11-ATI-BAA for the basic and applied research associated with an Airborne Weapon Layer (AWL) for the BMDS. MDA and the US Air Force (USAF) request submissions from industry in the areas of (1) airborne sensors, (2) air-launched kinetic interceptors, and/or (3) integrated sensor and interceptor approaches. The sensors, interceptors, and/or integrated approaches will result in end-to-end kill chains on existing or planned USAF combat aircraft, US Navy (USN) combat aircraft, or other innovative platforms. MDA and the Air Force are investigating an AWL that emphasizes engagements against ballistic missiles in the first third of their trajectory (boost and early ascent phases) while also providing capabilities for descent and terminal phase engagements. MDA and the Air Force request performance, cost, and schedule information on an AWL that can support a proof of principle flight demonstration within 3 years in order to determine its relative utility. The demonstration will serve as proof of technological feasibility and provide an assessment of producibility.</p>
<p>B. Concept of Employment. The information below provides a brief overview of expected basing, desired operational employment, and potential involvement of partners. Additional information on the Concept of Employment will be provided at the Industry Days.</p>
<p>(1) AWL capability will be forward based to provide immediate response to emerging crises and potential conflict. AWL capability stationed in the United States will provide Homeland Defense and rapid theater augmentation.</p>
<p>(2) AWL may be integrated in both offensive counterair and defensive counterair operations. Offensive counterair using AWL would likely focus on integration within attack operations packages. Defensive counterair operations would likely focus on engagements against ballistic missiles in the first third of their trajectory, but would also include area defense and point defense of critical assets. Offensive counterair and defensive counterair capabilities are to be provided in the context of their associated operational altitudes and positions. For more information on counterair operations, refer to Joint Publication 3-01, Countering Air and Missile Threats, 5 Feb 07 found here: www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_01.pdf. <br /><br />(3) AWL will be tasked to quickly integrate with air and naval forces to gain operational advantage over the adversary.</p>
<p>(4) AWL may conduct operations using decentralized execution with engagement authority delegated to the individual fire unit (platform operator). Delegation would be consistent with the rules of engagement, defended asset lists, and platform position depending on other missions assigned and maneuvers for self-defense.</p>
<p>(5) AWL will also transmit and receive data including situational awareness, sensor cues, and fire control solutions with other air, space, land, and maritime air defense assets using normal communication/data link and air defense networks. Integrated fire control engagements may occur based on AWL formation tasking, or they may be directed by engagement authorities outside the formation.</p>
<p>(6) AWL should be considered for Allies and multi-national partners through international armament cooperation.</p>
<p>C. Major AWL Components. Respondents should consider:</p>
<p>(1) Platform. Potential platform options include current or future fighters, bombers, or remotely piloted vehicles (RPV). For submission preparation purposes, respondents may use F-15C, F-35A, B-1B, MQ-9, and/or others as a baseline for their reply; however, innovative concepts using other platforms are encouraged.</p>
<p>(2) Sensors and Integrated Sensor Approaches. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches should address the following functions: detect, track, target, and provide/support a valid fire control solution, state vector, and covariance at extended ranges from the ballistic missile launch site. Both organic and networked concepts will be considered. Sensor capability should support the full range of interceptor capabilities without degrading aircraft performance beyond that of current targeting pods on aircraft. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches should also provide capabilities for engagements against multiple ballistic missiles, warheads, and/or reentry vehicles with capability for basic classification/typing and discrimination. Sensors or integrated sensor approaches may introduce new equipment, modify existing equipment, or integrate combinations of new, modified, and existing equipment to include radars, infrared search and track systems, targeting pods, etc. Modifications to existing equipment should not adversely affect primary mission functions of the platform.</p>
<p>(3) Interceptors. Interceptors should be compatible for carriage and employment across all speeds and G loadings for USAF fighters, bombers, and unmanned aircraft systems. Interceptors may be carried internally or externally on fighters, bombers, or RPVs. Interceptors for internal carriage should be sized and shaped to fit within an F-35A internal weapons bay without interfering with other internal weapons carriage and employment. Options that can be integrated on multiple platforms are desirable over single-platform concepts. Interceptors may also be compatible with carriage and employment from USN combat aircraft. Interceptors should be capable of engaging basic and complex ballistic missile threats. Interceptors may take an incremental development approach that provides an interim capability enroute to final capability. Final production interceptors should also meet insensitive munitions requirements. Interceptors should be compatible with carriage and employment from existing air-to-air and/or air-to-ground weapons stations on fighter, bomber, or RPV to the maximum extent practical. Unique equipment required for carriage and employment of interceptors shall be included in the interceptor reply.</p>
<p>(4) Communications. AWL platform will use current and/or planned platform-specific communications/data link capabilities to provide information to and receive information from other AWL assets or Missile and Air Defense Networks. This includes state vectors, covariance, and fire control quality data. Both organic and networked performance will be considered. Requirements for AWL communications capabilities beyond these parameters shall be included in responses.</p>
<p>(5) Integration. Respondents should address integration issues for sensor(s) or interceptor(s) onto the aircraft and interface with platform fire control and communications systems.</p>
<p>3. BAA Submissions with Supplemental Information.</p>
<p>A. Cost. Cost proposals should be prepared in accordance with the instructions as provided under the MDA ATI BAA, HQ0147-11-ATI-BAA Proposal Preparation Instructions. Please reference Section 6 of this document for information on obtaining these instructions. Additional cost information may be requested at a later date.</p>
<p>B. Schedule. Estimated schedule for the RDT&amp;E effort.</p>
<p>C. Proof of Principle Flight Demonstration Plans. Estimated schedule, cost, and risk for conducting a flight demonstration within 3 years.</p>
<p>D. Data Rights and Assertions.</p>
<p>E. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and Risks.</p>
<p>(1) Overall TRL and substantiating evidence to support assessment of TRL.</p>
<p>(2) TRL of major system components and interfaces and substantiating evidence to support the given component TRL assessment(s).</p>
<p>(3) Test demonstration. Description of any near-term demonstrations which would provide the capability to observe targets of opportunity, determine target state estimates, and compare these estimates with the actual target states (test range developed, best estimate).</p>
<p>(4) Technical risks.</p>
<p>F. System Considerations.</p>
<p>(1) Kinematic intercept capabilities/envelope against ballistic missiles in all phases of flight (boost, mid-course, and terminal) as specified in the classified exemplar threat trajectories package.</p>
<p>(2) Operating area for each interceptor against ballistic missiles in all phases of flight as specified in the exemplar threat trajectories.</p>
<p>(3) Time-to-launch, given threat notification.</p>
<p>(4) Alternative missions or engagement regimes supported.</p>
<p>G. Sensor and Integrated Sensor Approach Performance. Applicable technical information is requested for items listed in Attachment 1: Sensor Performance Template.</p>
<p>H. Interceptors. Applicable technical information is requested for items listed in Attachment 2: Interceptor Performance Template.</p>
<p>I. Integration. Approach should address all integration issues for the sensor(s) or interceptor(s) onto the aircraft and interface with platform fire control and communications system.</p>
<p>J. Opportunities to leverage other programs to reduce cost, accelerate schedule, and/or fill multiple missions.</p>
<p>4. Industry Days. MDA and the Air Force will host AWL Industry Days on 12-13 December 2011. Discussions of technical and operational considerations will be held on the morning of the first day.

National Lakes Assessment 2012
The contractor shall provide supplies for the National Lakes Assessment.  EPA will provide the quantity and product specifications for the supplies (see below).  
The contractor shall provide 75 of each of the following items:1)	Simple plankton net with 50-micron mesh: A standard Wisconsin-style plankton net 30-cm mouth diameter (with a 20-cm to 30-cm net cowling) x 90-cm length x 50 micron mesh net x 9-cm cod end aperture and bridle assembly, 2-pc cod end assembly with detachable lower section that is perforated with 50-micron mesh, ballast weight-	Plankton net: heavy duty nylon net of 150 micron mesh with a mouth to length ratio of 1:3-	Ring and 3-point bridle-	Collecting bucket: two-piece design with fasteners; perforated design with 150-micron mesh; ballast weight

2)	Simple plankton net with 150-micron mesh: A standard Wisconsin-style plankton net 30-cm mouth diameter x 90-cm length x 150 micron mesh net x 9-cm cod end aperture and bridle assembly, 2-pc cod end assembly with detachable lower section that is perforated with 150-microns mesh, ballast weight-	Plankton net: heavy duty nylon net of 150 micron mesh with a mouth to length ratio of 1:3-	Ring and 3-point bridle-	Collecting bucket: two-piece design with fasteners; perforated design with 150-micron mesh; ballast weight

3)	Carrying Cases for plankton netsEach case should hold two nets.
4)	Gravity sediment corer:For gravity coring operation, the end of the deployment cable is attached to the top of the main coring body and lowered as fast as possible through the water when approaching the bottom to allow gravity and inertia to drive the corer barrel into the sediment.
These gravity core units should include a core head with a release mechanism, with plastic and stainless steel construction and a ball that is held in the open position by a release pin during water penetration to prevent frontal wave disturbance of sediments.  The corer should come with a 300-gm messenger that activates the release of the ball and sealing the core head.  This should create a vacuum seal that retains sediments in the core during retrieval.  A ballast, a weight that slips tightly over the core head, should provide easy adjustment of the corer weight.  The unit should also include a polycarbonate core tube with 1-cm scribe marks and tube caps for safe transportation of intact cores.
Each unit should include-	durable construction -	ball-type core retainer w/ latex band -	simple-all angle-release mechanism and messenger (at least 400 gm) -	20m lowering line and a line reel -	gravity weights-	one thin-walled core barrel should be clear and have an opening diameter of at least 68 mm and a length of 60 cm-	core extruding plug -	end caps -	spare caps-	carrying case -	any additional tools

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Description of work to be performed includes design work for the preparation of 100% complete working drawings and contract documents using edited VA Master Specifications to complete the following: 

The Architect/Engineer shall provide design services necessary to furnish:  Schematics, Design Development, Construction Documents, Technical Specifications, Construction Period Services, Site Visits, Cost Estimates, As-Built Documentation, and all other related information for Project 655-12-107, Building 22 Restrooms Renovations, at the VA Medical Center in Saginaw, Michigan.  This project will renovate the existing restrooms of Building 22.  Work will include completing an analysis of the extent of demolition and modifications to existing systems and/or components and design the complete renovation of building 22 restrooms for an area encompassing 679 sq ft.  Also included are demolition and removal of items being replaced, and installation of new items (commercial grade wall and floor finishes, tile, grout, plumbing fixtures, toilet room partitions, wall accessories, diaper changing stations, feminine hygiene dispensers, light fixtures, motions sensors, exhaust fans, air freshener dispensers, interior signage, ceiling tiles and grid).  Redesign each space to meet: Barrier Free Design Guide PG-18-13, ADA Accessibility Guidelines, and ABAAS Architectural Barriers Act of 1968.  Redesign each space to incorporate energy saving features.  Specify materials and finishes that are easy to maintain, durable, hygienic, timeless, and modern.  
Design completion timeframe is estimated to be 180 days after receipt of the Notice to proceed. The A/E firm shall also be required to perform construction period services after award of the construction contract. In accordance with FAR 36.204, the estimated magnitude of the resulting construction project is between $100,000 & $250,000.

Qualifications (SF330) submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the following criteria in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36.602-1 and VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) Part 836-602-1 as follows: 

1) Professional Qualifications: the qualifications of the individuals which will be used for these services will be examined for relevant work experience and accredited education (Bachelors of Science in the specific field minimum) and their record of working together as a project team. The specific state licensed/registered professional disciplines which will be evaluated are a minimum one of each (Michigan licensed architect, NCIDQ certified interior designer, mechanical engineer, electrical engineer, fire protection engineer, cost estimator, AutoCAD operator).  Note that lead engineer must be Michigan P.E. Other specialties are plumbing, asbestos abatement, lead abatement, 3D modeler. 
(2) Specialized Experience and Technical Competence: specific experience and technical skill in the type and scope of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in designing for federal agencies, healthcare design, eldercare design, research abilities for EBD (evidence based design), Planetree   organization compliance, knowledge of 2010 ADA Standards & NFPA 101 Life Safety codes, Knowledge of Joint Commission and HIPPA requirements, LEED certification, energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recycled materials. 
(3) Capacity to Accomplish the Work: the general work load and staffing capacity of the design office which will be responsible for 51% of the design, and the ability to accomplish the work in the required time will be evaluated. This includes ability to produce scaled construction documents in minimum version AutoCAD 2010. 
(4) Past Performance: the past performance of the firm on contracts relevant in scope to the advertised project that were accomplished with the Department of Veterans Affairs, other federal agencies, and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules will be examined. Project past performance references older than 3 years will not be accepted. 

(5) Claims and Terminations: record of significant claims against the firm or terminated contracts because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services will be examined. 
(6) Location of Design Firm: the geographic proximity of each firm to the location of the VA Medical Center will be evaluated. This criterion will apply to the office from which the majority of the design services will be performed.  Firms within 250 miles of the medical center will receive a maximum score. Firms more distant than 250 miles will receive a zero score for this criterion. 
(7) Memberships in professional associations: Each professional discipline has voluntary associations such as (AIA, ASID, AAHID, NSPE). The Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes that professionals who maintain association memberships are more invested in their field and are therefore more knowledgeable about current industry trends. 

Submission Requirements:
This procurement is 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB). Qualified SDVOSB firms are required to submit: 2 copies of Standard Form (SF) 330 (available at http://www.gsa.gov/forms) to include Part 1 and Part 2. In addition, Section H of Part 1 shall include information regarding the firms estimating effectiveness (estimated costs vs. actual bid costs) and compliance with performance schedule (original design schedule vs. actual design completion time) for each key design project listed in Section F. In addition, firms are requested to provide one electronic copy of their entire SF330 submittal via CD. Submission information incorporated by reference is not allowed. 

FAILURE TO CLEARLY ADRESS ALL SEVEN LISTED EVALUATION CRITERIA AND INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THE SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS ABOVE MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF SF330. 

Prospective SDVOSB firms are reminded that in accordance with VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) 852.219-10, at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance of the contract shall be spent for employees of the SDVOSB concern or employees of other eligible service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. SF330 package shall address how it is anticipated these criteria will be met.

The number one selected firm, unless currently listed as verified in the Vendor Information Pages at the www.vetbiz.gov database shall have five business days to submit a verification application upon notification of being found the apparent successful bidder. Failure to become registered and verified in the VetBiz registry will result in denial of contract award. After receipt of verification application, the VA Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) will conduct an SDVOSB verification investigation of the firm and based upon their findings will either find the firm eligible or ineligible for SDVOSB verification. Any AE firm that represents itself as an SDVOSB eligible firm but subsequently found ineligible for verification by VA OSDBU will result in that firm being barred from contract award. Interested firms are reminded that in accordance with FAR 4.12, prospective contractors shall complete electronic annual representations and certifications (ORCA) in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov database, prior to award of a contract (FAR 4.11).

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">Qiagen, Inc. Synopsis</p>
<p>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda, Maryland, intends to negotiate a on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1 (b), a service maintenance contract to include one base year and two option years for various Biorobot systems by Qiagen, Inc.</p>
<p>The model and serial numbers for the equipment are as follows: 1) Biorobot 8000 System, SN: A3720; 2) Biorobot 8000 System, SN: A3736; 3) Biorobot EZ1 System, SN: 0406F0506.</p>
<p>This service will be procured as a commercial item in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisition Procedures). The period of performance for the required maintenance agreement commences on 1 December 2011 and ends 30&nbsp;November 2012 with&nbsp;two (2) one year options.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on Qiagen, Inc. being the sole source for factory trained labor and technical services for all instrumentation manufactured and sold by Qiagen, Inc. Additionally, the Qiagen Biorobot systems are highly specialized in design and application requiring software and firmware updates and system components upgrades that are proprietary to the vendor. All major component parts and assemblies including circuit electronics are specialized in design whereby obtaining these parts from alternate sources as generic item is not possible and not in the best interest of the Government. Another vendor was not located that had the technical and specialized knowledge and/or accessibility to repair parts for this system. Therefore, Qiagen, Inc. is the one source reasonably available to meet the needs of the government.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quote. However, all interested parties may contact the Contract Specialist listed below. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can obtain/provide factory trained technicians and necessary replacement parts for the various Biorobot systems as specified above. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government. Responses must be submitted electronically, via email, to clarinda.washington@usuhs.mil. The deadline for the submittal of responses is 3 December 2011, 5:00 pm EST.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Construction and Facilities Management has Set-Aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business a need for a Landscape Architecture (NAICS 541320) or a Civil Engineering (NAICS 541330) firm capable of preparing design documentation including, but not limited to: surveying, soils investigations, master plans, schematic design documents, and design development documents. Prime contractor should have licensed/registered landscape architects as members of the firm, or team, with experience in the planning and design of cemeteries, large institutional campuses, parks and recreational facilities, or similar land development projects.  The following additional licensed/registered specialty disciplines should be members of the firm, or team with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields: Water Management/Irrigation specialist, Cost Estimator, Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing Engineers, and Architect. The contract will include a government option for: design build RFP package or construction document preparation; construction period services, and site visits. This procurement for an Architect-Engineer firm is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set-Aside.

Probable Scope:

The project will develop approximately 15 acres on land transferred from VHA which is adjacent to the existing cemetery and will provide for about ten years of burial capacity. Development will consist of approximately 3,000 gravesites including 2,500 casket interments, 750 columbarium niches and 250 in-ground sites for cremated remains. The project will also include memorial walls to commemorate those whose remains are not available for interment.  To optimize the use of available land for gravesites, the project will install pre-placed concrete crypts. In addition to the gravesite development, the construction includes access roads; an entrance area; flag/assembly area; two permanent committal shelters; an administration building/public information center with electronic gravesite locator and public restrooms; memorial walkway/donations area; maintenance complex; road system; utilities; signage; site furnishings; fencing; irrigation system as needed consistent with water-wise landscaping principles; utility distribution system; environmental (including historical and cultural resources) preservation and mitigation. GPS/GIS site integration is included in both the existing and new development scope. Demolition of structures within the existing cemetery is also included, as well as infrastructure repairs and upgrades as identified in the Study on Improvements to Veterans Cemeteries.

The new buildings will incorporate enhanced information technology and physical security requirements and shall include Green Building Principles and Renewable Energy Initiatives. The completed buildings shall be LEED silver certified and meet all Federal Energy and Sustainability mandates. Design shall include mitigation of any environmental and historic issues identified during the environmental assessment process.

Once a thorough analysis of the user's and the cemetery's needs has been completed, the scope and method of meeting those needs may change and require a different approach.

This project will be accomplished utilizing the VA Program Guide (PG-18-15, Volume D), A/E Submission Instructions for National Cemetery Projects, as well as the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) Facilities Design Guide.  

In addition to design capabilities, estimating capabilities of the applicants will be considered. An estimate of construction cost based on level of design detail will be required at each design phase. The selected firm shall design to the government's estimated cost for construction. Firms shall comply with approved Cost Accounting Standards in accordance with FAR Part 30.

The schematics and design development will include all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines and a firm estimate of construction cost. A possible solicitation will include a government option for: design-build Request For Proposal (RFP) package or construction document preparation; construction period services and site visits. In addition to design capabilities, emphasis will be placed on the cost and scope management capabilities of the applicants. Applicants must have an established working office within 200 miles of Mt. Home, TN, be of sufficient size and experience to accomplish the work, and be licensed in the State of Tennessee. 

No firm will be considered unless an application consisting of a completed SF 330 Part I and other evidence of experience and capabilities the applicant considers relevant is sent.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), located at 260 Industrial Way West, Eatontown, NJ 07724 intends to enter into a contract modification on the basis of other than full and open competition in support of the Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs (OCLA).  The TAC intends to award a sole source, one (1) year, firm-fixed price (FFP) contract modification with three (3) option years to Dynology Corporation, 8000 Towers Crescent Drive, Suite 1350, Vienna, Virginia 22182, pursuant to authority Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, for the development and maintenance of the VA Synchronization Matrix (Sync Matrix), to be included in the Dynology Strategic Communications Suite (DSCSTM) as part of the VA Congressional and Legislative Knowledge Management System (CLAKMS) recently awarded to Dynology Corporation.  VA's OCLA currently has a CLAKMS designed and maintained by Dynology Corporation to plan, capture, coordinate, record, and report engagements and interactions that occur between the leaders of VA and Members of Congress and their staff who are key partners in providing Veterans with the benefits and services they have earned.  VA has a requirement to add Sync Matrix calendar functionality to CLAKMS to capture, synchronize, and strategically manage major internal and external public affairs and strategic communications events planned by Veterans Affairs Central Office (VACO) and VA Administrations.  The Sync Matrix module will interface with CLAKMS to query all scheduled events (past, present, and future), so that one authoritative source of event data is maintained and shared by all end-users/organizations.  This interface will eliminate the need for VA end-users to perform double entry and manual synchronization of event data, and will ensure data consistency and improve communication and efficiency across cooperating VA organizations.  The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) for this effort is 511210 with a corresponding small business size standard of $25M average annual revenue.  The estimated date of award for this action is December 21, 2011. 

This notification shall close on Friday, December 8, 2011.  The Points of Contact (POCs) for this action are Kimberly Flynn, Contract Specialist, kimberly.flynn1@va.gov and Mark Junda, Contracting Officer, mark.junda@va.gov.

<DESC>The purpose of this sources sought is to identify potential sources capable of manufacturing Light Weight (LW) 30MM M789 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge, NSN 1305-01-268-9373, Part No. 12902728.  Special equipment is required to produce these cartridges.<br>Production of the cartridges is very complex and requires sophisticated industrial capabilities.  The manufacturing process encompasses, but is not limited to: (1) machining of projectile body, fuze, and copper liner metal parts, (2)fuze production, (3) production of propellant, (4) flash tube loading, cartridge case priming and loading with propellant and (5) Load, Assemble, and Pack-Out (LAP) of the completed cartridges.  The LAP for M789 cartridges requires highly specialized facilities, equipment, and tooling for the safe storage, handling, transportation, weighing, consolidation and testing of high explosives and fuzes. In most cases the production processes dealing with high explosives and fuzes must be performed remotely. The facilities must be specially designed and fabricated to meet DOD hazard/safety standoff requirement in order to mitigate the risk of propagation in the event of an unintended initiation of explosive materials.  Additionally the LAP personnel must be specially trained to work with explosives. For each step of the manufacturing process, sophisticated test and measuring equipment is required to ensure the final products comply with Government requirements.  An approved ballistics test range, M230 MANN barrels and M230 Automatic Gun are required to perform First Article and Lot Acceptance Tests on these cartridges.  Production support equipment includes material handling systems, tool room equipment, furnaces for heat treat and annealing, metal forming and machining equipment, anodize and phosphate systems, ultrasonic and x-ray test equipment and metrology and metallurgy laboratories. Other critical skills required to manufacture the M789 include, but are not limited to ammunition process/design engineers, explosive experts, set-up mechanics and operators, quality control engineers, certified ultrasonic and x-ray technicians, metallurgists and ballistics test personnel.  <br>A First Article Acceptance Test (FAAT) may be required within eight months after award.  <br>SPECIFICATIONS: This item is purchased to a Technical Data Package (TDP) which are classified as Distribution "D".  Distribution Statement D means distribution authorized to the Department of Defense and U.S. DOD contractors only (Critical Technology).  This TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, (Title 22, U.S.C., Section 2751 et seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50, U.S.C., app 2401, et seq.  Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties.  Offerors must be registered with the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office.<br>  <br><br>PLANNED ACQUISITION:  A one year Firm Fixed Price contract with a 100% Option is contemplated for this effort.<br><br>SUBMISSION INFORMATION: Interested U.S./Canadian firms who feel they are capable of manufacturing the M789 cartridge are invited to indicate their interest by providing the Government a brief summary of their company's capabilities, facilities, personnel and past manufacturing experience to: Army Contracting Command, Rock Island Contracting Center, ATTN: CCRC-AF Rosalie Lashbrook, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL  61299-8000, or electronically to Rosalie.m.lashbrook.civ@mail.mil.  Please respond no later than 9 December 2011 and identify the 30MM M789 Source Sought/Market Research as the subject of your response.  This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request For Proposal (RFP)or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.<br>

<CONTACT>Tanisha L. Walcott, Contract Specialist, Phone 2024470612, Email tanisha.walcott@dhs.gov - Robert Degnan, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-447-5576, Fax 202-447-5725, Email robert.degnan@dhs.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />For the<br />Department of Homeland Security (DHS)<br />National Protectorate and Programs Division (NPPD) National Cyber Security Program<br />Situational Awareness Incident Response (SAIR) Tier III Project.
<p><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) as identified in FAR 15.201 (c)(7). This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time, and this notice shall be not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.</p>
<p><br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Cyber Security Division is requesting industry feedback on existing Government product performance requirements involving the Situational Awareness Incident Response (SAIR) Tier III project. The objective of SAIR Tier III is to provide U.S. Government (USG) agencies the ability to assess, assure, monitor, and measure the security posture of their information technology (IT) assets in a timely manner (i.e., near-real time.) This RFI provides an opportunity for respondents to submit their ideas and initiatives related to this request. Additionally, respondents will have the opportunity to comment on the draft product performance requirements for SAIR III listed on Attachment 2.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate industry feedback on Government SAIR III technical requirements then the Government may hold an industry day to answer any specific questions related to this RFI. The Government may use feedback that results from this RFI and industry day to further refine technical requirements to potentially establish qualified product list (QPL) for COTS products that can be utilized by federal, state, and local Governments for Information Security Continuous Monitoring.</p>
<p>If the development of a QPL results from this RFI, DHS NCSD will be responsible for managing the QPL in terms of testing and evaluating COTS products to ensure proposed products meet any developed SAIR III minimum technical requirements. This QPL will be developed for multiple federal agency use. Product acquisitions will be at the discretion of each individual agency. The potential QPL may be established as guidance to assist federal agencies in managing information system security capabilities across the federal civilian enterprise.</p>
<p>1. BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Information Systems Security Line of Business (ISSLOB) was created in 2005 to improve the level of information systems security across government by eliminating duplication of effort, increasing aggregate expertise and enhancing the overall security posture of the Federal Government. This value proposition is supported through the use of Shared Service Centers (SSC's), consolidated acquisitions, agency standard practices and lessons learned across agencies.<br />In 2007, the ISSLOB launched a series of procurements under the Situational Awareness Incident Response (SAIR) Initiative. Based on guidance from the Federal Systems Security Governance Board (FSSGB), the oversight body of the ISSLOB, the SAIR procurements follow a tiered execution approach. The SAIR initiatives are aimed at providing an efficient, cost effective mechanism to deliver enhanced information system security capabilities across the federal civilian enterprise. <br />The cyber landscape in which federal agencies operate is a constantly changing and dynamic environment. Threats to the nation's information security continue to evolve and government leaders have recognized the need for a modified approach in protecting our cyber infrastructure. The new approach moves away from historical compliance reporting toward combating threats to our nation's networks on a real time basis. The tools and services delivered through the SAIR Tier III project will provide federal agencies with the ability to enhance/automate their existing continuous network monitoring capabilities, correlate and analyze critical security-related information, and enhance risk-based decision making at the agency and federal enterprise level. Information obtained from the automated monitoring tools will eventually feed CyberScope and allow for the correlation and analysis of security-related information across the federal enterprise.</p>
<p>2. SAIR III TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>The capabilities sought for SAIR Tier III are:</p>
<p>1. Asset Management Tools. Products that provide the ability to document, track, and discover both authorized and unauthorized IT assets. Such as NIST-SCAP validated asset management tools. <br />2. Configuration Management Tools. Products that provide the ability to assess, monitor, and report compliance of agency-specified security configuration settings and patches, as well as real-time altering of changes to approved baseline configurations for hardware, software, user access and security controls. Such as NIST SCAP-validated FDCC scanners and authenticated configuration scanners. <br />3. Vulnerability Management Tools. Products that provide the ability to discover, identify, and locate known security vulnerabilities and software security weaknesses; and report the associated potential exposure risks using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and the Common Weakness Scoring System (CWSS<sup>TM</sup>). , For example: NIST SCAP-validated authenticated vulnerability &amp; patch scanners, unauthenticated vulnerability scanners, source code security analyzers, web and database vulnerability scanners.<br />4. Malware Detection Tools. Products that provide the ability to discover, isolate, characterize, and report known malware for supporting agency's security incident response process. Such as Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization (MAEC<sup>TM</sup>) -compatible malware tools. <br />5. Situational Awareness Analysis and Reporting Tools. Products that provide the ability to collect, associate, compile, and report security posture metrics in terms of IT security governance and operational effectiveness. For example: The governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) reporting tools and FISMA security authorization management tools.</p>
<p>Where the capabilities are defined:</p>
<p>1. Asset Management Function: System functions that support the management of hardware and software inventory baseline by documenting, tracking, and discovery of agency-responsible IT assets (i.e., hardware, software, and virtualized configuration items); and to identify unauthorized IT assets.<br />2. Configuration Management Function: System functions that support the management of security configuration baseline by documenting and tracking compliance with agency-specified security configuration settings and software patches (i.e., compliance with Federal Desktop Core Configuration [FDCC], USG Configuration Baseline [USGCB], and Security Technical Implementation Guides [STIGs], etc.) This includes system functions that provide continuous real-time detection and alerting of unauthorized changes to baseline configurations for hardware, software, user access, and security controls for perimeter defense and the core IT operating environment. <br />3. Vulnerability Management Function: System functions that discover, identify, and locate known security vulnerabilities and software weaknesses (i.e., the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures [CVE&reg;] and the Common Weakness Enumeration [CWE<sup>TM</sup>]); , and support the understanding of their associated potential exposure risks (i.e., metrics generated from the Common Vulnerability Scoring System [CVSS] and the Common Weakness Scoring System [CWSS<sup>TM</sup>].) <br />4. Malware Detection Function: System functions that discover, identify, characterize, and locate known malware in a standard language (i.e., the Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization [MAEC<sup>TM</sup>]) for supporting agency's incident response process.<br />5. Situational Awareness Analysis and Report Function: System functions that collect, associate, compile, and report metrics that support analysis in the understanding of security posture in terms of IT security governance and operational effectiveness."</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) addresses the ISSLOB's information systems security need for tools to support a continuous monitoring capability. <br />The draft performance requirements these tools must possess can be found in the attached document, SAIR III Product Performance Requirements for Information Security Continuous Monitoring.</p>
<p>3. RFI PURPOSE AND LIMITATIONS:</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought for Special Operations Forces Requirements Analysis, Prototyping, Training, Operations and Rehearsal III (SOF RAPTOR III)<br><br>Solicitation Number:   W900KK-12-SR3<br>Notice Type:		Sources Sought<br>Title:			Special Operations Forces Requirements Analysis, Prototyping, Training, Operations and Rehearsal III (SOF RAPTOR III)<br>Contractor Vehicle:	TBD<br>Closing Date:		December 23, 2011<br><br>Brief Summary:  The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Product Manager for Special Operations Forces (SOF) Training Systems (PM STS) is conducting market research to determine interested sources and technology capabilities vendors for a new contract which would replace and expand the existing Special Operations Forces Requirements Analysis, Prototyping, Training, Operations and Rehearsal II (SOF RAPTOR II) contract.  SOF RAPTOR II supports numerous efforts in support of the objectives of United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) programs and Component Commands.  The new SOF RAPTOR III procurement is intended to support not only the objectives of USSOCOM programs but to support the objectives of the joint SOF community that USSOCOM interfaces with to conduct operations.  <br><br>Program Description:  PM STS has a need for a contract vehicle to replace the existing SOF RAPTOR II contract which is close to reaching its ceiling.  The SOF RAPTOR II contract, awarded in April 2009 with a ceiling of $48.9M,  is a single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle.  This contract vehicle provides the means for conducting training requirements analysis, concept exploration, prototyping, advanced concept exploration, rapid prototype development, and operation and maintenance functions to support USSOCOM and USSOCOM Component Command training, simulator and simulation requirements.  SOF RAPTOR III will provide a vehicle that incorporates the scope of the SOF RAPTOR II contract and will be refined to include scope and tasks that will support all elements of mission preparedness and mission training.  Mission preparedness, rehearsal, and training includes primarily SOF tasks and includes the joint community that USSOCOM operates and interfaces with such as the NATO Special Forces partners and other Government agencies.  <br><br>The SOF RAPTOR III requirements include, but are not limited to:<br><br>a)  Conducting requirements analysis and concept exploration which may consist of Analysis of Alternative (AoA), new technology concept exploration, market surveys, feasibility studies, specifications, and generation of white papers.<br><br>b)  Designing, developing and delivering prototype systems and/or subsystems to users.

Monitor, record, and track aircraft and combat system configuration changes and provide impact statement pertaining to the system modifications.  <br><br>f)  Provide support for selected exercises, demonstrations, experiments, planning, and rehearsal and execution events. <br><br>g)  Develop courseware and training modules including program of instruction, lesson plans, practical exercises, and a train-the-trainer package to accommodate new equipment training, sustainment training, and training of testers and evaluators.  Provide system operation and maintenance familiarization training through a combination of classroom, written instructions, and/or hands-on operation.  <br><br>h)  Provide instructors for individual, team, and joint missions training.   Provide operators for SOF systems and training.<br><br>i)  Provide various types of systems management support necessary to support, maintain, and operate the SOF systems including:  logistics management functions;  configuration management; quality assurance and control and data management functions;  maintain an Information Assurance (IA) process to guide management decisions and design actions.<br><br>j)  Support networking and networked exercises within SOF locations and between USSOCOM and the USSOCOM joint community locations.  Integrate, operate, and maintain distributed simulation-based architectures.  This includes both commercial and DoD simulation standards required to support interoperability across live, virtual, and constructive domains.<br><br>k)  Provide facility interface support which includes analyses of facility structural, mechanical and electrical subsystems; and participate in site surveys, site preparation, trainer facility design reviews, and device installation.  <br><br>l)  Conduct verification, validation, and certification of systems and products, including data collection, analysis, and documentation.<br><br>m)  Provide mission training to Warfighters at their home-station, in-the-field, ranges, or at locations around the world.  This includes basic training through mission preparation and rehearsal.<br><br>n)  Assist SOF customers with geospatial database issues, including rapidly creating and compiling geospatial databases, and enhancing existing geospatial databases.  Providing or modifying 3D models that are used in mission training.<br><br>Acquisition Approach:  The Government is currently developing an acquisition strategy for SOF RAPTOR III.

Note: This is NOT a "bidders conference" and this announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind. The Government will not assume liability for costs incurred by any offeror for presentations, marketing efforts or data offered for examination; therefore the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government. For those that cannot make the Industry Day, a copy of the slides used will be posted to FBO as well as the questions and answers. DESCRIPTION: SMC/SD will be conducting an Industry Day for Space Test Program (STP) Commercial Hosting of Advanced Technology Payloads (CHATPs). The purpose of this meeting is to provide interested companies/entities with an overview of specific areas of interest, promote an early exchange of information, and provide an opportunity for both the Government and Industry to gather more information prior to the request for studies that will be published on the FBO web site. STP is seeking feedback from Industry with respect to the draft CHATP BAA-SMC-SD-011 posted on FBO on 23 Nov 2011 to understand if the draft BAA, Call-001, and supporting documents, as written, present challenges to Industry that can be revisited prior to finalization of the CHATP BAA and Call-001. STP encourages review of the draft posting and feedback from Industry for discussion at Industry Days. The Space Test Program seeks to study the feasibility of using commercial providers and practices to integrate, test, launch, and provide on-orbit support for STP hosted payloads (HPs). HPs are experiments requiring payload integration and testing, launch, and on-orbit operations support through a scheduled commercial Host Space Vehicle (HSV). The Draft CHATP BAA (BAA-SMC-SD-011) and first Call to that BAA will be posted in advance of the Industry Day. Attendees are encouraged to review these announcements to support discussions and provide questions. A general session will be held in the morning each day, from 0830 to 0930 for interested parties to obtain information from the Government Program Managers and Contracting team. Check in time is from 0800 to 0830. Individual sessions with interested companies will be scheduled during the remainder of each day. There is no set format for individual sessions. Companies can provide a presentation, ask questions, provide feedback to the draft BAA, or a combination of these. Currently 30 minutes are allotted per individual session. It is recommended that companies plan to attend the general session the morning of their individual session. Technical POCs: CATERCIA S.

<DESC>The Bureau of Public Debt, on behalf of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) intends to award an Order to SyBase Inc. on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, for Annual End of Life Renewal Product Support.
<p>Market Research conducted revealed that although there are re-sellers on GSA that sell Sybase software, only Sybase itself can provide the extension EOL Sybase software.</p>
<p>Sybase decided to stop support for the Replication Server, Replication Agent (LTM) technology on January 28, 2012. Under the GSA Contract, companies can announce end of life for a product and then stop support a year later. Sybase put out the announcement on their website in January 2011.</p>
<p>OCC cannot put a new technology into production by January 28, 2012, therefore we need to request "extended support".<br /><br />The OCC Examiner View application employs a data extract capability that enables remote disconnected bank examiners the ability to perform examinations and access the data necessary to carry out the mission.</p>
<p>As stated only Sybase Federal itself can provide the extension EOL Sybase software.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by December 7, 2011 by 12:00am ET. Responses shall be submitted to PSB3@bpd.treas.gov, Attention B. Cooper/P. White.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons on the mailing list. Therefore, we recommend that you monitor the FedBizOpps site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions. Responses to this request can be emailed to psb3@pbd.treas.gov - Attention: Brian Cooper/Paul White.</p>

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories seeks interested parties for commercializing a patent-pending hybrid polymer-nanocomposite optical coating technology, a recipient of two prestigious R&amp;D 100 awards. Compared to expensive and complex vacuum-deposition techniques such as sputtering or chemical vapor deposition (CVD), this evaporation-driven self-assembly technology allows simple dip, spray, or reel-to-reel deposition of optical quality films. Multilayer films have been demonstrated for high-reflectivity and antireflection, as well as hydrophilic and superhydrophobic surface properties. This platform technology enables a critical breathrough in optical materials: the independent management of optical and chemical properties of an optical-quality film. It is potentially suitable for use on large or irregular surfaces including solar panels, windshields, or consumer electronics.
<p>Sandia seeks to license technologies for the benefit of the US industry. It is anticipated that commercial licenses may grant rights on a competitive basis to qualified interested parties for appropriate consideration. Licensing options may include grants for defined fields of use, non-exclusive rights, exclusive, or sublicensing rights. Partnerships to commercialize this technology may also take the form of Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs).</p>
<p>Sandia National Laboratories is a multiprogram laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

<ARCHDATE>12072011
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:paula.somers@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>Rsponses due 1200 (EST) on December 07, 2011.Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWAR) - Atlantics (SSC-A) Requestfor Information (RFI) is for a shelter to house communications equipment tosupport the Afghanistan security and police forces.   SSC-A has been tasked toprovide an emergency communication capability for up to twenty - three (23)districts within Afghanistan.  The phase one (1) capability is for six (6)INITIAL (start  up) sites with an expansion to seventeen (17) sites making ita total of twenty  three (23) sites. The intent of this RFI is to obtain COTSproduct information that can support the power requirements, heating andcooling of electronics, and housing/protection of the electronics year round.This system will need to operate 24 hour x seven days per week (24 x 7).  Thepurpose of this document is to request information for shelter and solar/powerproduct providers to support Afghanistan emergency communication mission.SSC-A will eventually provide sheltered communication systems and services tothe Afghan National Security Forces Police and Afghan Local Police (ALP).  TheAfghan National Police (ANP) and ALP forces were created under the Governmentof the Islamic Republic of Afghanistans (GIRoA) Ministry of Interior (MoI) inorder to protect its citizens.  Due to limited traditional communicationsinfrastructure, this communications project will facilitate host countrysecurity through services that provide ANP/ALP with a means to complete fieldpolice work and contributes to providing law enforcement services to the localpopulace.SSC-A will be procuring communications equipment separately.Power/space/heating requirements for this equipment are as follows:Vendor will supply equipment racks inside the shelter for mountingcommunications equipment.  Equipment racks must be standard size (19 incheswide, 1.75 inch Rack units) and steel construction.  The communicationsequipment that needs to go in the shelter is approximately 8 rack units high,no more than 24 inches deep.  Communications equipment weighs 60 lbs total.Communications equipment requires 900W of continuous power (24/7), 1100Wsurge.  Vendor will supply power via ten BS-1363 receptacles, 240VAC singlephase, 50Hz.  IEC 320 C13 receptacles may also be used.Communications equipment in the shelter will emit roughly 1300 BTU/hr.  For thepurpose of this RFI, vendors will assume that half of the communicationsshelters will be placed in Kabul, and half will be placed in Kandahar.  Theoperating temperature range of the communications equipment is from 10C to 35C.The system will be capable of being powered 100% by green power such as solar.A small backup diesel generator will be provided by the vendor for use whenbatteries are depleted due to extended inclement weather.  The green powersystem and batteries shall be capable of providing power to the system for 24hours with no sunlight, assuming a full charge.  The generator and fuel tankprovided shall be capable of powering the shelter for a minimum of 36 hourswithout being refueled.Solar panels must be capable of being placed on the ground with little to nosite preparation or infrastructure.  The recipient of the equipment has noheavy machinery to perform site construction, lay concrete pads, etc.  However,for purposes of this RFI, the vendors may assume the ground is level.  Thesolar panels will be placed in a secure location, but may not require more thanone (1) acre of land.  The entire system, solar panels and shelters, will beplaced in a non-shaded area.To minimize risk of theft of power components, vendor is encouraged to usealternative DC voltages for batteries and inverters.  To minimize risk of theftof generators, vendor is required to place the generator and fuel tank insidethe primary shelter, or in a separate shelter/skid plate that does not allowdirect access to controls and components.  To minimize fuel consumption andreduce real estate needs, vendor is encouraged to minimize sizing of systemHVAC and shelter.Vendor will provide Automatic Transfer Switch to facilitate switching fromgreen power source to diesel generator.  AC service must be continuous throughload switches to and from the generator.All outdoor equipment such as solar panels must be able to fit in standard ISOcontainers for shipping.The shelter may be any size up to a thirty foot ISO container.  The shelterwill not be manned, and no provisions for human occupation are desired.  Vendoris encouraged to evaluate smaller than standard size ISO (8 ft wide, 8 ft tall)containers, but also encouraged to minimize cost.Design of shelter must allow/facilitate movement via standard military andcommercial shipping methods.HVAC system, generator, and solar panels must be able to work in the harshenvironment (especially dust particles) of Afghanistan.Vendor will supply grounding rods and associated cabling.  No other externaldependencies will exist.Each of the 23 systems will be going to separate district locations eventually,therefore each system must be packaged separately.All information received will be used by the SSC-A Afghanistan Communicationsproduct team to support our technical solution for integration purposes.  Itwill not be shared outside the government Communications Product Team and willbe utilized to support our technical solution.SSC-A request for information (RFI) is focused on evaluating shelter and powerproviders to support its mission.  This RFI is for a shelter, powersupply/distribution, HVAC only as selected by SSC-A.  Please include thefollowing with your technical submission: (1) Administrative Information; (2)Technical Submission; (3) Cost information; and (4) Lead time on equipmentordering.Please provide Administrative Information below: Company information, main staff point of contact (POC) info, including name,address, phone number, and website link (as available). Whether the company is a product provider, technical consultant,manufacturer, and/or distributor.Please address all items and design drivers below as part of your TechnicalSubmission (include Cost and lead time ordering information)1. Product name and a brief description (no more than one page per product).2. Product solution shall require minimum real estate.  Provide physical sizeof system and each component including the shelter.3. The communications equipment will be integrated into the shelter by thegovernment.  Currently our requirements are to provide a green power solutiontherefore power consumption is considered important.a.

<DESC>NOTE:  The requirements under this RFI replace N65236_SNOTE_0002DE36.Responses are due no later than 1200 [EST], on 7 December 2011.Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWAR) - Atlantics (SSC-A) Requestfor Information (RFI) is for a shelter to house communications equipment tosupport the Afghanistan security and police forces.   SSC-A has been tasked toprovide an emergency communication capability for up to twenty - three (23)districts within Afghanistan.  The phase one (1) capability is for six (6)INITIAL (start  up) sites with an expansion to seventeen (17) sites making ita total of twenty  three (23) sites. The intent of this RFI is to obtain COTSproduct information that can support the power requirements, heating andcooling of electronics, and housing/protection of the electronics year round.This system will need to operate 24 hour x seven days per week (24 x 7).  Thepurpose of this document is to request information for shelter and solar/powerproduct providers to support Afghanistan emergency communication mission.SSC-A will eventually provide sheltered communication systems and services tothe Afghan National Security Forces Police and Afghan Local Police (ALP).  TheAfghan National Police (ANP) and ALP forces were created under the Governmentof the Islamic Republic of Afghanistans (GIRoA) Ministry of Interior (MoI) inorder to protect its citizens.  Due to limited traditional communicationsinfrastructure, this communications project will facilitate host countrysecurity through services that provide ANP/ALP with a means to complete fieldpolice work and contributes to providing law enforcement services to the localpopulace.SSC-A will be procuring communications equipment separately.Power/space/heating requirements for this equipment are as follows:(1)  Vendor will supply equipment racks inside the shelter for mountingcommunications equipment.  Equipment racks must be standard size (19 incheswide, 1.75 inch Rack units) and steel construction.  The communicationsequipment that needs to go in the shelter is approximately 8 rack units high,no more than 24 inches deep.  Communications equipment weighs 60 lbs total.(2)  Communications equipment requires 900W of continuous power (24/7), 1100Wsurge.  Vendor will supply power via ten receptacles, 240VAC single phase,50Hz.  IEC 320 C13 receptacles may also be used.(3)  Communications equipment in the shelter will emit roughly 1300 BTU/hr.For the purpose of this RFI, vendors will assume that half of thecommunications shelters will be placed in Kabul, and half will be placed inKandahar.  The operating temperature range of the communications equipment isfrom 10C to 35C.(4)  The system will be capable of being powered 100% by green power such assolar.  A small backup diesel generator will be provided by the vendor for usewhen batteries are depleted due to extended inclement weather.  The green powersystem and batteries shall be capable of providing power to the system for 24hours with no sunlight, assuming a full charge.  The generator and fuel tankprovided shall be capable of powering the shelter for a minimum of 36 hourswithout being refueled.(5)  Solar panels must be capable of being placed on the ground with little tono site preparation or infrastructure.  The recipient of the equipment has noheavy machinery to perform site construction, lay concrete pads, etc.  However,for purposes of this RFI, the vendors may assume the ground is level.  Thesolar panels will be placed in a secure location, but may not require more thanone (1) acre of land.  The entire system, solar panels and shelters, will beplaced in a non-shaded area.(6)  To minimize risk of theft of power components, vendor is encouraged to usealternative DC voltages for batteries and inverters.  To minimize risk of theftof generators, vendor is required to place the generator and fuel tank insidethe primary shelter, or in a separate shelter/skid plate that does not allowdirect access to controls and components.  To minimize fuel consumption andreduce real estate needs, vendor is encouraged to minimize sizing of systemHVAC and shelter.(7)  Vendor will provide Automatic Transfer Switch to facilitate switching fromgreen power source to diesel generator.  AC service must be continuous throughload switches to and from the generator.(8)  All outdoor equipment such as solar panels must be able to fit in standardISO containers for shipping.(9)  The shelter may be any size up to a thirty foot ISO container.  Theshelter will not be manned, and no provisions for human occupation aredesired.  Vendor is encouraged to evaluate smaller than standard size ISO (8 ftwide, 8 ft tall) containers, but also encouraged to minimize cost.(10)  Design of shelter must allow/facilitate movement via standard militaryand commercial shipping methods.(11)  HVAC system, generator, and solar panels must be able to work in theharsh environment (especially dust particles) of Afghanistan.(12)  Vendor will supply grounding rods and associated cabling.  No otherexternal dependencies will exist.(13)  Each of the 23 systems will be going to separate district locationseventually, therefore each system must be packaged separately.All information received will be used by the SSC-A Afghanistan Communicationsproduct team to support our technical solution for integration purposes.  Itwill not be shared outside the government Communications Product Team and willbe utilized to support our technical solution.SSC-A request for information (RFI) is focused on evaluating shelter and powerproviders to support its mission.  This RFI is for a shelter, powersupply/distribution, HVAC only as selected by SSC-A.  Please include thefollowing with your technical submission: (1) Administrative Information; (2)Technical Submission; (3) Cost information; and (4) Lead time on equipmentordering.Please provide Administrative Information below: Company information (including size of business), main staff point of contact(POC) info, including name, address, phone number, and website link (asavailable). Whether the company is a product provider, technical consultant,manufacturer, and/or distributor.Please address all items and design drivers below as part of your TechnicalSubmission (include Cost and lead time ordering information):1. Product name and a brief description (no more than one page per product).2. Product solution shall require minimum real estate.  Provide physical sizeof system and each component including the shelter.3. The communications equipment will be integrated into the shelter by thegovernment.

<SUBJECT>A--Further investigate the development of biomarkers for assessing in situ RDX biodegradation potential

<a href="mailto:danielle.j.grunwald@usace.army.mil">USACE HEC, Ft. Belvoir</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a sole source cost (completion form) type contract to Michigan State University to provide services to further investigate the development of biomarkers for assessing in situ RDX biodegradation potential.  The goal of the original project was to identify the microorganisms able to degrade RDX in situ and develop molecular tools so that the presence and abundance of these organisms can be investigated at different contaminated sites.  The project involved the screening of ten soils for RDX degradation and the development and application of SIP to identify RDX degraders. This SIP approach has two distinct advantages i) RDX degradation can be investigated in mixed cultures and environmental samples (more typical of contaminated site conditions) and ii) only active organisms are targeted. RDX degradation activity was noted in six of the ten soils and degradation occurred only under anaerobic conditions. The SIP experiments involved exposing soil microcosms to labeled RDX, DNA extraction, DNA ultracentrifugation (to separate the labeled nucleic acid from the unlabeled background nucleic acid), terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify the organisms responsible for label uptake from RDX. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated the organisms responsible belonged to either the Sphingobacteria or the Acidobacteria. These bacteria have had no previous links to RDX degradation, indicating the discovery of novel RDX degraders. Given that the proof-of-concept that SIP could be used to identify in situ RDX degraders in complex, mixed culture samples was proven successful, it was determined that a follow up effort is needed to identify the microorganisms responsible for the degradation of the environmental contaminant RDX using the molecular method SIP which will aid in the prediction of the potential for natural attenuation of RDX contamination. <br><br>Although much is known about pure cultures able to degrade RDX in the laboratory, ER-1606 confirmed that SIP could be used to identify in situ RDX degraders in complex, mixed culture samples allowing members in the scientific community with a means to better understand the microorganisms responsible for RDX degradation at contaminated sites which could provide a line of evidence for RDX natural attenuation.  After conducting the initial limited-scope work under this project, it was determined that a follow up effort is needed to identify the microorganisms responsible for the degradation of the environmental contaminant RDX using the molecular method SIP.  The work is important because the microorganisms responsible for in situ RDX degradation are unknown.  Greater understanding of the microbiology and biochemistry responsible for RDX biodegradation in situ would improve the ability to predict and monitor the success of natural attenuation.  The identification of key biomarkers that are consistently found in samples where RDX degradation is occurring will provide a third line of evidence for natural attenuation that is currently not available.<br><br>Michigan State University is uniquely qualified as they worked on the initial limited-scope effort to identify the microorganisms able to degrade RDX in situ and develop molecular tools so that the presence and abundance of these organisms can be investigated at different contaminated sites.<br><br>This is a special notice prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the date of publication of this announcement.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will proceed with awarding a Cost type contract to Michigan State University for Development of Biomarkers for Assessing In Situ RDX Biodegradation Potential.  These services will be provided to the Strategic and Environmental and Development Research Program Office, Arlington, VA.  Point of Contact for this requirement is Jonathan Current at Jonathan.J.Current@usace.army.mil, 7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22315.

These sessions will be between a single vendor and the VA and not open to other attendees. At the end of the CPM Update session or after the one-on-one sessions vendors may provide the VA with any product literature.

An allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (j) of this clause.<br />(b) For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government." As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for those item(s).<br />(c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for a subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause or otherwise agreed to by the parties.

The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.<br />(e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled "Disputes."<br />(f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause.<br />(g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled "Default."

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Central Supply Room (CSR) Wraps. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Womack Army Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgery Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, GA; MMESO West: Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, and 48th Medical Group, RAF Lakenheath; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Region, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA TS Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.<strong> Anticipated selection date is March 2012.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong>Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. Points of Contact: Mr. Kevin Hill, MMESO South, Team Leader, Kevin.w.hill@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3270. Mrs. Sarah Allen, Clinical Analyst, sarah.l.allen@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3287. </strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of CSR Wraps. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $1,917,859.41. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, 79 of the total 111 line items account for 92.21% ($1,768,543.40) of the total volume in sales $ 1,917,859.41 in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Kevin Hill, MMESO South, Team Leader, Kevin.w.hill@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3270. Mrs. Sarah Allen, Clinical Analyst, sarah.l.allen@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3287.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO South via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></span></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO South reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br />Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements <br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the technical/company requirements outlined below.

Vendor must send the MMESO South verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. 1 case or minimum of 50 each size and style listed below are to be provided to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.<br />Item Description Number Each to Send To Each Facility<br />1 Wrap Central Supply Disposable, 1 Ply, Non-Woven, SMS (Spunbond Meltdown Spunbond) Fabric 24 x 24 Regular weight 1 case or minimum of 50 eachs <br />2 Wrap Central Supply Disposable, 2 Ply, Non-Woven, SMS (Spunbond Meltdown Spunbond) Fabric 36 x 36 Medium weight 1 case or minimum of 50 eachs<br />3 Wrap Central Supply Disposable, 2 Ply, Non-Woven, SMS (Spunbond Meltdown Spunbond) Fabric 54 x54 Heavy duty weight 1 case or minimum of 50 eachs</p>
<p>Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation will be conducted using the below listed requirements with responses as either a "YES" (meets/passes requirements) or "NO" (does not/fails to meet requirements) answers. The MMESO JPRB has established that the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization will be eighty percent (80%) of the requirements questions answered as "YES" (meets/passes requirements). A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO South and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately 15 MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements <br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below.</p>
<p>1. (Drapeability /Flexibility - ISO 11607-2:2006 -- Packaging for terminally sterilized medical devices - Part 2: Validation requirements for forming, sealing and assembly processes). Product conforms to the content/equipment pack contours smoothly and can open on a flat surface. The CSR Wrap must be strong but conform to contents and remain intact throughout the sterilization process so that sterility of the package can be maintained.<br />2. (ISO 11607-1:2006 -- Packaging for terminally sterilized medical devices - Part 1: Requirements for materials, sterile barrier systems and packaging). CSR Wraps are low linting or non-linting. The Wrap must be low or non-linting to reduce the introduction of particulate matter into open wounds.<br />3. (Aeration - ISO 11607-1:2006 -- Packaging for terminally sterilized medical devices - Part 1: Requirements for materials, sterile barrier systems and packaging). Product allows post-sterilization dissipation of moisture/sterilants used. The CSR Wrap must allow for post-dissipation of moisture as retained moisture would contaminate the product.<br />4. (Permeability/penetrability - ISO 11607-1:2006 -- Packaging for terminally sterilized medical devices - Part 1: Requirements for materials, sterile barrier systems and packaging). Product allows for the effective penetration of sterilants (steam, ethylene oxide, plasmas, irradiation, ozone and moisture. CSR Wrap barrier must effectively allow penetration to provide sterility. <br />5. (Durable Package Integrity - ISO 11607-2:2006 -- Packaging for terminally sterilized medical devices - Part 2: Validation requirements for forming, sealing and assembly processes). Product resists punctures, tears and abrasions during normal use. The Wrap must be strong, flexible and remain intact throughout the sterilization process for sterility of the package to be maintained.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO South and must be received by 5:00PM CST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></span></p>

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format of FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are not being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NIAID-NOI-12019. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC2005-54, dated November 2, 2011. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business set-aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516, which has a size standard of 500. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure a personal microarray system on a sole source basis from Affymetrix. Item/Description/Quantity: 1) GeneAtlas Academic System, 115v, #00-0394, (includes: hybridization station, fluidics station, imaging station, computer workstation and monitor, GeneAtlas instrument control software, external barcode reader, and GeneAtlas installation kit), qty-1. The GeneAtlas Academic System is to allow simplified hybridization to not create a hybridization chamber assembly, robustness that protects precious samples, unlike fragile slide-based designs, limited hands on time, and simple array processing with common microwell-based labware. The lab has been working specifically conducting a number of clinical research projects that address the feasibility of eradication of HIV in infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. These protocols included: 1) Effect of integrase inhibitor (MK-0518) on decay of and low levels of viral replication in HIV reservoirs in infected individuals who initiated conventional antiviral therapy during the chronic phase of infection and 2) Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-Specific Immune Reconstitution after Myeloablative Hematopoietic Cell Transplant for Treatment of Hematologic Malignancy in Patients Infected with HIV. This equipment will allow processing of 4 gene chips on one strip. This allows a run of 4 independent samples simultaneously, which is a critical feature for the lab to minimize experiment to experiment variations. By running 4 related patient samples on one strip gene chips, the lab can minimize any experiment errors that are associated with running samples independently. Finally, the lab has been using Affymetrix gene chips for many years. It is important to continue with gene chips manufactured by Affymetrix to validate our previous data. Affymetrix gene chips cannot be used with instruments from any other vendors. Award will be based on the following 1) meeting the salient characteristics, 2) price, 3) delivery, and 4) warranty. Delivery shall be made 30 days after receipt of order to Bethesda, Maryland 20892. FOB point shall be Destination. This will be a firm-fixed price contract.

	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*
	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	5.  Red:		Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*

* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.

(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the suppliers percentage of on time deliveries.
  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.

(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.

(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and under the authority of FAR 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation includes the incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-54. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 334516 with an SBA size standard of 500 employees and this requirement is NOT being conducted as a small business set-aside.
The US EPA Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), National Enforcement Investigations Center (NEIC) has a requirement for an Advanced Geospatial Mapping and Ambient Monitoring System for Greenhouse Gases: Gas Concentration Analyzer System (UV detector) in accordance with the attached specifications. This instrument, a field portable ultraviolet (UV) detector, will form the second part of an enhanced, mobile, monitoring system for use in support of enforcement and potentially, assessment applications. The UV gas concentration analyzer emission quantification system required by NEIC must have the following features:  
1.	Simultaneous measurement of benzene, ethyl benzene, toluene and all three isomers of xylene.2.	High detection sensitivity:  This refers to the ability of the instrument to measure concentrations of compounds at low levels, specifically, 5 parts per billion by volume of (ppbv) benzene in air (time integration of one minute). This requires a high resolution spectrometer (e.g. http://www.oceanoptics.com/products/hr2000.asp or better) to separate spectrally interfering compounds, coupled with a suitable UV light source and a well-designed, long-path, UV multi-pass absorption cell (path length likely >16m) to provide linear absorption distance required for low detection limits. The offeror shall describe how they calculate minimum measureable quantities and provide proof of performance. 3.	The instrument package must be rack mountable in a standard 19 inch instrument rack. The instrument package must have a small form-factor so that it can be installed in an instrument rack inside of the mobile unit. The physical dimensions of the UV spectrometer must be significantly less than 1m x 0.25m x 0.25 m and weigh less than 30 kg. Inside of the instrument is a multi pass absorption cell which should be as small as possible for reasons discussed below. The physical size of a multi-pass absorption cell is inversely related to the number of ?passes? (internal reflections). For example, an 18 m optical cell could be nearly 9 m in length size if it has only two passes, or 0.5 m in size with 36 passes. A small form factor for the UV spectrometer means that the UV optical cell must also have a small form factor and have many passes so that a long path length can fit inside of the rack-mountable package. The optical cell design is a critical factor for the envisioned mobil e unit. The optical cell needs to have a robust mechanical design, high reflectivity mirror coatings, and a well-collimated source.4.	The instrument must be insensitive to mechanical vibration that is experienced in the mobile application. Again this comes down to the quality of the optical cell design and its ability to maintain alignment. The optical cell and the way it couples to the source and spectrometer must be specially designed to be resistant top vibration effects. Physically smaller packages (and more compact optical cells) have less mechanical vibration coupling modes so this is an advantage in vibration isolation. It is also easier for EPA ORD engineers to design and implement secondary vibration isolation systems on smaller instrument packages.5.	The instrument must be capable of > 2 Hz time-resolution data output rates. The instrument must be capable of > 2 Hz time-resolution which includes a fast data output rate of the spectrometer (minimum 2 Hz) and sufficiently fast air movement through the cell. For the latter, the external blower systems to be developed by EPA ORD must be capable of moving air through the cell fast enough to clear the cell in subsection time periods. This means the smaller and more compact the optical cell volume, the easier it will be to obtain the required time resolution. Additionally, using lower flow through rates will improve the detection capability of the unit since air turbulence and air-induced vibration found when using fast flow rates degrades measurement sensitivity. The air pumping system that ORD will use to ensure >2 Hz response rate will work for a 2 litter cell volume. If the optical cell volume is significantly greater than 2 L, the overall response time of the system will  not be acceptable.6.	The optical cell volume (air exchanged region) must be less than 2 liters. This is to allow sufficiently fast air movement through the cell to achieve the system time-resolution of >2 Hz with EPA supplied pumps. 7.	The User must be able to selectively save spectral files for QA purposes.8.	Supporting software, ethernet connection, and ability to write files to a USB drive9.	Delivery must be F.O.B. destination the National Enforcement Investigations Center (NEIC) at Denver Federal Center, Bldg 25, Denver, CO 80225.  The exact dollar amount of any and all shipping, handling, insurance and F.O.B. destination fees must be conspicuously listed as a separate line item on quotations.
The Government anticipates issue of a firm-fixed-price (by line item) Purchase Order for this requirement.
Basis for Award: The Government will make award to the responsive, responsible firm, whose quotation is most advantageous to the Government on a best value basis.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protests issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer of Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), United States Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 2100 2ND Street, SW, Stop 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protests issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer of Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), United States Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 2100 2ND Street, SW, Stop 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

     MCAGCC Access/Security Requirements-Contractor and Contractor-Employee Access Conditions:   

1.  Access Procedures Are Mandatory:  All contractor employees are required to obtain business access or permanent business access.  Daily access procedures must not be used to circumvent background check requirements outlined below.  Attempts to improperly use daily access procedures may result in denial of access to the involved employees. 

2.   Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one day to one year.
  Submit the following:  

	A valid form of Federal or state government I.D.
	If driving a motor vehicle, a valid driver's license, vehicle registration and proof
	of insurance.
	Proof of employment on a valid Government contract (e.g., a letter from the
	prime contractor including contract number and term).
	Proof of an employee background check conducted within the past year
	covering the previous two years.  Contractor employee background checks are
	conducted at contractor expense.  The background check:

(a)	must establish the employee's citizenship or legal alien status.  Acceptable documents include birth certificate, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) forms and passports.
(b)	must include proof of a criminal records check from the county or state where the employee resided for the previous two years (or length of legal residence for foreign nationals in the U.S.
 for less than two years).  
(c)	will be subject to Government verification via the FBI National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Interstate Identification Index (III).  If the background check is selected for  verification, the employee will be required to submit fingerprint records to the FBI Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) database.  NCIC checks and fingerprinting will be performed at
Government expense.

Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshals Office (PMO)  of the Combat Center.  For the MCAGCC/MAGTFTC, this process includes the completion of a COMBAT CENTER ACCESS AUTHORITY letter issued by the Regional Contracting Office (NW).
  

3.  Permanent Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one to three years.  Submit all items listed above under business access.  NCIC check and fingerprint of all contractor employees will be conducted at Government expense.  Contractor-provided background checks will be reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractors expense.

4.  Emergency Access:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities.
  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  

5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  

6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.
  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee:
	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List.
	b.    is illegally present in the United States.
c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant.
d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information.
	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations.

7.
  Employee Identification:  Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall be readily identifiable as an employee of the contractor through the use of uniforms or nametags, or via an alternate method approved by the Contracting Officer. 

8.  Employee Compliance.  The Contractors employees shall observe and comply with all MCAGCC/MAGTFTC rules and regulations applicable to contract personnel, including those applicable to the safe operation of vehicles, and shall not be present in locations not required for the proper performance of this contract. Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks. Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel.

9.
  Contract Termination:  The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.  



USMC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION (AUG 2006)
  To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, "ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF PAYMENT REQUEST (JAN 2004)", the United States Marine Corps (USMC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents electronically.  
The contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports under this contract/order, unless the provision at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies.
 The contractor shall (i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration at http://www.ccr.gov and (ii) register to use WAWF-RA at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.
The USMC WAWF-RA point of contact (POC) for this contract is SAUNDRA WURST and can be reached at 760-830-5121 or email saundra.wurst@usmc.mil. 
The contractor is directed to use the  Invoice and Receiving Report "Combo" for Goods.
Please do not process WAWF-RA electronic documents until proof of delivery has been received by your organization.
When entering the invoice into WAWF-RA, the contractor shall use the following DoDAAC fields:
Contract Number	
Delivery Order	
Cage Code/Ext	
Pay DoDAAC	M67443
Issue Date	Use Date on Page 1, Block 31c.
Issue By DoDAAC	M67399
Admin By DoDAAC	M67399
Ship To Code/Ext	Acceptor Code: 
Ship From Code/Ext	Leave Blank
LPO DoDAAC	
Leave Blank 
Acceptor 
Contract Specialist	Email: 
Email: 
Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext	Leave Blank  

Please do not process WAWF-RA electronic documents until proof of delivery has been received by your organization.

In some situations the WAWF-RA system will pre-populate the Issue By DoDAAC, Admin By DoDAAC and Pay DoDAAC.
 Contractor shall verify those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF-RA system match the above information. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the contractor shall correct the field(s) and notify the Contracting Officer of the discrepancy (ies). Step by step WAWF-RA invoicing procedures for Combo, 2-in-1, and Cost Voucher are available at the USMC paperless site at http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/pa/ under Vendor Interface section. On the Vendor Interface page click on WAWF-RA header at the top of the page. Under downloads on the WAWF-RA page that appears, click the appropriate document either Combo,  2-in-1, or "Cost Voucher to download the instructions. 
Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF-RA, but after submitting the document or documents, the contractor will be prompted to send additional email notifications.
 Contractor shall click on Send More Email Notification on the page that appears. Add the acceptors/receivers email address (Note this address is their work email address not their WAWF-RA organizational email address) in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF-RA system.  
 
NOTE: The POCs identified above are for WAWF-RA issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to whom questions are to be addressed.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Program Office provides OTI with strategic guidance on country-level and office-level budgeting, strategy, and program performance issues, and increases key stakeholder awareness of and support for OTI as a key instrument in carrying out U.S. foreign policy objectives. The Program Office maintains technical oversight of the Support Which Implements Fast Transitions (SWIFT) IQC and the Programming Development Quickly (PDQ) IQC, and manages coordination of programming within the Foreign Assistance (F) framework. The Program Office plays a key role in the initial country assessment process, periodic country program and management reviews, and final evaluations. The Program Office also provides support to ongoing country programs through managing country budgeting decisions and allocation of resources, and setting standards and providing guidance on strategic planning, decision-making, and implementation. In addition, the Program Office provides reports on country activities for DCHA, OMB, Department of State, and Congress.</p>
<p>The Program Office serves as a central processing point for budgetary and programmatic information, and also provides guidance and standardization of OTI and Agency-wide policies and regulations. The Program Office has regular interaction with country program teams, and reports directly to the Senior Leadership Team (SLT). The Program Office supports country program operations through improved strategic thinking, planning, and decision-making; instituting strategic budgeting; facilitating the design and procurement of new implementation mechanisms; and strengthening reporting, communications and outreach.</p>
<p>The Program Assistant/Specialist will assist in performing key Program Office actions, including: budget planning, tracking, accruals, and reconciliation; new country program planning; reporting and strategic outreach; and program performance review and monitoring. The Program Assistant/Specialist will also provide country program assistant support for OTI program-funded staff when required.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items apply to this acquisition:</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>a. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i. Past Performance <br />ii. Price</p>
<p><br />Paragraphs b and c are not applicable as shown below:</p>
<p>b. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>a. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: The Government intends to award contract to offeror which represents best overall value in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history and price will be considered. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to ALL solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. The government reserves the right to reject any offer that does not meet all requirements of the solicitation. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>
<p>b. The evaluation will be conducted using simplified procedures outlined in FAR 13.106. In accordance with simplified procedures, contracting offices may conduct comparative evaluations of offers. Evaluation of other factors, such as past performance --<br />(i) Does not require the creation or existence of a formal data base; and<br />(ii) May be based on one or more of the following:<br />(A) The contracting officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;<br />(B) Customer surveys, and past performance questionnaire replies;<br />(C) The Government wide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov ; or<br />(D) Any other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>c. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: <br />Step 1. Rank all proposals by price. IAW FAR 13.106-2 The contracting officer is allowed to make comparative analysis of offers to establish best overall value to the government. <br />Step 2 - Evaluate all quotes for ability to meet all requirements of the solicitation. Offerors that do not conform fully to the solicitation will not be considered.<br />Step 3 - Review any and /or all past performance information as stated above. <br /><br />d. PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS: The performance assessment process will result in an overall performance rating of "Sufficient Past Performance" or "Limited Past Performance". Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Past Performance", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUFFICIENT PAST PERFORMANCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITED PAST PERFORMANCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN PAST PERFORMANCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>e. When determining relevancy and assigning a past performance confidence rating, the government will consider the type of experience, the amount of experience, and the flexibility of contractor to meet customer needs.</p>
<p>Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Past Performance," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an "Unknown Past Performance."</p>
<p>g. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Sufficient Past Performance" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Limited Past Performance" or when it is in the best interest of the government to do so.</p>
<p>i. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Sufficient Past Performance" rating, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Sufficient Past Performance" performance rating or until all offerors are evaluated.</p>
<p>j. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions.</p>

The Government will evaluate the offeror's certification that their product is equivalent or higher in quality and completely compatible and interchangeable with Herman Miller Action Office Systems product.<br>The Government will evaluate other relevant criteria, but NOT limited to:<br><br> 	Ability to deliver the requirements when and where required;<br> 	The proposed plan of approach and work schedule;<br> 	Quality of proposal including any innovative concepts;<br> 	Material swatches/samples and product literature/brochures;<br> 	Any other criteria set out in the RFQ or otherwise reasonably considered relevant.<br>Each Offeror quote will be evaluated on the technical capabilities/specifications/Salient Characteristics.

In evaluating the Price Factor, the Government will perform an evaluation to determine the fairness and reasonableness of the proposed prices in accordance with FAR 15.404-1 (b).  The Government is seeking the offerors price that meets or exceeds all requirements outlined in the SOW.<br><br>Acceptable: A quote is acceptable if it meets or exceeds minimum requirements in the solicitation.  <br><br>Unacceptable:  A quote will be deemed unacceptable if it does NOT meet or exceeds minimum requirements in the solicitation.  A lack of minimum content or failure to address all evaluated areas could render a quote unacceptable. <br><br>The award will be made on the basis of initial quotations without discussions (although the right to conduct discussions, if necessary, is reserved).

<DESC><p>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS</p>
<p>Global Positioning Systems Directorate (SMC/GP) - Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) Extension of Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) Contract No. FA8807-07-C0002</p>
<p>Air Force Space Command, Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Global Positioning Systems Directorate (SMC/GP), 483 North Aviation Boulevard, El Segundo, California, 90245-2808 intends to issue a sole source contract action to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), S&amp;R and Intelligence Systems Services, Los Angeles, California, 90056-1299, to provide Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) support services to SMC/GP for up to 12 months beginning no earlier than 9 March 2012. This contract action will effectively extend the period of performance of the SE&amp;I services currently being acquired under Contract FA8807-07-C-0002, thereby providing SMC/GP sufficient time to complete a source selection and award a long-term follow-on contract. Unless the award decision for the follow-on contract is protested, after award of that long-term follow-on contract, SMC/GP will not exercise any remaining options and will terminate for convenience the remaining period of performance of the contract action that is the subject of this synopsis. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 5.207(e), the classification code for this synopsis is 18 (Space Vehicles). Pursuant to FAR Section 5.207(c)(6), approximately 353,788 hours will be acquired for Systems Engineering and Integration using 3600 appropriations, and approximately 18,123 hours will be acquired for Systems Engineering and Integration using 3020 appropriations. A copy of the existing Statement of Work (SOW) is appended herewith for reference.</p>
<p>This contract provides a highly capable SE&amp;I contractor/team to produce and manage the GPS technical baseline in support of SMC/GP. The SE&amp;I's role in the accomplishment of this mission will involve, but is not limited to, development and implementation of directives and standards, improved and dynamic communications, new tools and techniques to predict issues early enough to change the outcome or minimize the effect on the enterprise, disciplined processes to develop and maintain the systems baseline documents and interfaces, and performance metrics that ensure continuous integration and operational capability improvements (measures of effectiveness). The current contract was awarded 9 March 2007. All options have been exercised and the contract will expire on 8 March 2012.</p>
<p>This contract action will be awarded to SAIC S&amp;R and Intelligence Systems Services as the only responsible source that can continue to provide these highly specialized services, as it is likely that award to any other source would result in the Air Force incurring substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition, experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements, or both. (10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)).</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) no later than 15 days after posting of the subject notice/Sources Sought Synopsis, which shall be considered by the agency.

Interested parties must demonstrate in their SOC they have the capability to provide the systems and services to fulfill the government's immediate, short-term need for the projects described above. Interested parties must also demonstrate how an alternative approach can be cost competitive with the long term sustainment activities described above. The SOC shall not exceed 10 single-spaced pages.</p>
<p>This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government. The government will not pay any costs associated with the submittal of information solicited herein. The SOC and all related communications that contain proprietary information should be marked as such. No classified information shall be submitted. Verbal responses will not be accepted.

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories seeks interested parties for commercializing a patent-pending hybrid polymer-nanocomposite optical coating technology, a recipient of two prestigious R&amp;D 100 awards. Compared to expensive and complex vacuum-deposition techniques such as sputtering or chemical vapor deposition (CVD), this evaporation-driven self-assembly technology allows simple dip, spray, or reel-to-reel deposition of optical quality films. Multilayer films have been demonstrated for high-reflectivity and antireflection, as well as hydrophilic and superhydrophobic surface properties. This platform technology enables a critical breakthrough in optical materials: the independent management of optical and chemical properties of an optical-quality film. It is potentially suitable for use on large or irregular surfaces including solar panels, windshields, or consumer electronics.
<p>Sandia seeks to license technologies for the benefit of the US industry.

AEC SOUTHWEST DIVISION AND ITS SURROUNDING AREAS IDIQ TYPE CONTRACTS # : W9126G11R0069<br><br>Is this a new effort or was there a previous contractor that fulfilled similar requirements in the past?  If the latter, would you be able to inform me of the:<br><br>Contractor Name<br>Contract #<br>Value<br>Expiration Date<br><br>Also, the sources sought notice mentioned that there will be multiple pools; unrestricted and authorized set asides--would you happen to know if that means there will be more than one Solicitation released for this effort?  If that is the case, do you know how many Solicitations will be released and for which set-asides?  <br><br>ANSWER: This is a new effort for a new suite of MATOC contractors to replace the 2009 MATOC pools. There are numerous contractors. There will be an estimated five pools; Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HubZone and Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned Business yet to be determined. There will be more than one solicitation issued but when solicitations are issued it will be decided before hand which pool will get that solicitation.

If so, could you please provide the Incumbent names as well as the contract number?<br> <br>Thank you for your time,<br>ANSWER: This is a new effort for s new suite of MATOC contractors to replace the 2009 MATOC pools. There are numerous contractors. See previous question for a list of contractors.<br><br><br>25 Oct 11:<br><br>If awarded such a contract, can the contractor turn down work which may be outside their bonding capacity?<br><br>Description states that the projects can be from 500,000 to 70,000,000 with each contractor being asked to perform on up to three project simultaneously.  <br> <br>Most small business cannot bond at the 70,000,000 level, but can bond at the 500,000 level...that is where the question above is relevant.<br> <br>What is the minimum bonding capacity required for the project?<br><br> ANSWER:  The $70M level will more than likely be reserved for the Unrestricted pool.  At this point please answer questions 1-6 on the sources sought with one of them asking what your bonding capacity is. This will help determine the appropriate method of setting aside portions of the requirements for small businesses. <br><br><br>28 Oct 11:<br><br>The sources sought synopsis states that the average size task order will be $20,000,000. It also states that it is anticipated that there will be multiple pools (unrestricted and authorized set-aside pools), with three to five contracts per pool. Please clarify the average task order size with respect to the type of pool:  Will the average task order size vary depending on the type of pool (i.e., 8a set-aside pool, HubZone set-aside pool, unrestricted pool, etc.)?  If yes, is it known at this time what the average task order size would be for each pool?<br><br>ANSWER:  AN AMENDMENT WILL BE FORTHCOMING CHANGING THE STATEMENT OF THREE TO FIVE CONTRACTS PER POOL TO AT LEASTTWO OR MORE CONTRACTS PER POOL AND IT IS NOT KNOWN AT THIS TIME WHAT THE AVERAGE TASK ORDER SIZE WOULD BE FOR EACH POOL.<br><br>Will the proposed contracts for each pool (unrestricted and set-asides) cover the entire SWD geographic area, or is it possible that certain pools may cover only certain regions within the SWD area?<br><br>ANSWER: BOTH AREAS OF COVERAGE ARE POSSIBLE...THE MATOC CONTRACT POOLS MAY VARY...COVERING AN ENTIRE SWD GEOGRAPHIC AREA OR CERTAIN REGIONS WITH THE SWD AREA.<br><br> <br>31 Oct 11<br><br>Regarding this opportunity which is now processing a Sources Sought market survey, will the multiple pools mean that the pools will never be competing for the same project?  We are a design firm and will be asked to be the design sub-consultant for both a small business and a large business D/B teams.  If the pools are discrete and never compete for the same project, we can support both size general contractors in separate pools, but if they could pursue the same project among all pools, we would have a conflict and could only support one firm.  Please advise how the multiple-pool competition will work.  Thanks.<br><br> ANSWER: A Project will only be competed within one (1) MATOC pool, either the Unrestricted pool or one of the set-aside pools.<br><br>1 Nov 11<br>Assuming sufficient capabilities are determined will the RFP be two separate solicitations, one of an unrestricted pool and one for a restricted pool? The reason for my question is we would pursue both with the appropriate sized contractor but would not want to be in direct completion with each if they were both in the same pool. Tkg<br><br>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE: The RFP will only be issued to one pool. Different pools will not compete for that same RFP. <br><br><br>2 Nov 11<br><br> Reference the Unrestricted portion of the W9126G-11-R-0069 sources <br><br>Looked over a list of existing unrestricted Fort Worth MATOC's and it looks like this will replace or share a similar capabilities with the "SWD Vertical Construction MATOC - Unrestricted Pool"   scheduled to expire in August of 2014.  <br><br>If awarded, is this seen as a replacement for the existing contract or a new initiative?  <br><br>ANSWER:  This will be used to replace the existing MATOC pool once capacity expires.<br><br><br>31 Oct 11<br><br>Our company is new to government contracting and government jobs. We just started looking in the government sector because of the opportunities for Service Disable Veteran Small Owned Businesses such as ours. I kind of have an idea what is going on from what I read in the synopsis but it also raised some questions.  <br><br>I would like to get more information on project - solicitation # : W9126g-11-R-0069. Such as:<br><br>Are you looking and or awarding for a Prime General contractor only? (Design/build)<br>Answer: Yes<br>	<br>Is there Prime contracting for design only?<br>Answer: No<br><br>Do you pair up prime general contractors with qualified subs?<br>Answer: No<br>	<br>As far as the working areas, we are based in San Diego Ca area, could we ask for the California contracts only? Our engineers are only license in California.<br><br>Answer:  No and your engineers can only practice in CA if that is the state they are registered in. It should become clearer when the actual solicitations are issued as far as where work can be performed but chances are the Contractor will have to perform in other than CA or multiple states/locations.<br>2 Nov 11<br>Could you please verify if the Sources Sought Synopsis for this opportunity is due on November 18th or November 30th? There are two different dates on the solicitation and we would like to respond.<br><br>ANSWER: November 30, 2011<br> <br><br><br>2 Nov 11<br>I am a Service Disable Veteran, a Veteran Owned, and a Disadvantaged Business owned business. I own a Construction Company and I am interested in working in TX, LA, NM, OK.I want to give you bids for al five-state region. I am a minority and I am expressing an interest and I hope that you will set aside some or all of this work for people with a small business.<br> <br>ANSWER: We will use the information gathered from this Sources Sought synopsis to determine the method of set-asides that will provide the greatest opportunity for all business concerns.  Please submit your capabilities statement and provide the information requested in the sources sought.  <br><br>3 Nov 11<br>Of the contract pools anticipated to be awarded from this solicitation, will any be specifically structured for 8(a) and Small Businesses? Also, will these small business pools be required to carry out the same task order sizes described in the solicitation, or will smaller task orders be offered for the Small Business?<br> <br>ANSWER:  The type(s) of set-asides and task order sizes will be based on the information obtained from responses to the sources sought and other market research being performed.  <br><br>7 Nov 11<br>I am interested in getting a synopsis package on the above project please advise me on what procedure I need to do.<br><br>ANSWER:  There is no "synopsis package" other than what has been published in FBO.  Please provide the information requested in the Sources Sought Synopsis.<br><br>4 Nov 11<br>Our company is a SDVOSB. Is it permissible to respond to the sources sought for W9126G-11-R-0069 as a team to show how we would actually execute Task Orders of the magnitude described in the pre-solicitation? <br> <br>ANSWER: Provide the information requested in the synopsis.  <br><br><br>15 Nov 11<br><br>We are an architecture firm and we are teaming with a contractor to submit for this Sources Sought.  For a Design-Build Source Sought must the Contractor be the main point of contact or can the Architect be it?  For a Design-Build Source Sought is "offerors" referring to both the contractor and architecture firm? If so, just for clarity purposes, I would provide offeror's name, address, and phone number for both contractor and architect correct?    I apologize for so many questions, but it is our first time filling out a Design-Build Source Sought.  Thanks so much.<br><br>ANSWER:  The Prime Contractor should provide a response to the sources sought. D-B teaming arrangements will be described during the solicitation process. <br><br><br>17 November<br>Where may I download a copy of Sources Sought Information Request Form<br><br>ANSWER:  There is no form.  Provide the information requested in the Sources Sought Synopsis. <br><br><br>17 November 2011<br>Do you happen to know if the seed project for the subject sources sought for the SWD IDIQ has been identified?<br><br>ANSWER:  This is a sources sought synopsis. The question is not applicable at this time.<br><br>18 Nov 11<br>What are the maximum, minimum and average task sizes for the Small Business ("SB") alternative IDIQ pools?<br>ANSWER: Sources sought states a minimum of $500,000 per task order, an average of $20 Million per task order and a Max task order of $70 Million.. The average task order size for for SB set-aside(s) will be approximately $10M.<br><br>If there is a seed task, what and where is the expected seed task for each of the IDIQs, both SB and Unrestricted ("UR")?<br><br>ANSWER: This is a sources sought synopsis  The question is not applicable at this time.<br><br>Will an SB be required to submit separate responses for separate SB pools or may it submit a single response identifying the various SB pools for which it is eligible?<br><br>ANSWER:  You may submit a single response for the sources sought and identify all set-aside categories that apply to your firm.<br><br> If an SB demonstrates sufficient capacity to participate in the UR pool, may it compete in both SB and UR pools using a single proposal or must the SB submit separately for each such solicitation?<br><br>ANSWER:  A SB firm may submit a proposal on the Unrestricted MATOC pool if the SB can meet the requirements (especially bonding capacity) for the Unrestricted pool.<br><br>Will offers be required solely in electronic form or will paper and electronic proposals be required?<br><br>ANSWER:  It is anticipated that offers will be requested in electronic format only..<br><br>Will Offerors be allowed to use the recently-issued USACE standard Past Performance Qualifications for relevant experience for which there is no CCASS/CPARS rating and no other equivalent on file?<br><br>ANSWER:  Yes.<br><br>Please confirm that all pools will be Best Value procurements, and not Low-Price, Technically Acceptable or other procurements, or specify the procurement form for any pool that will not be Best Value.<br><br>ANSWER:  The evaluation method for this requirement has not yet been determined.<br><br>Will the solicitation for UR and SB pools be single-step or two-step procurements?<br><br>ANSWER:   Not yet determined.  This will be identified when solicitations are posted.<br><br>If a solicitation is to be single-step, will the seed task be design-build or design-bid-build?<br><br>ANSWER: Not yet determined.  This will be identified when solicitations are posted.<br><br> If a solicitation will be two-step, what is the maximum number of firms that the government will advance for competition in Phase 2 in each of the SB and UR pools?<br><br>ANSWER:  Not yet determined.  This will be identified when solicitations are posted.<br><br>Will the government include an emphasis on Past Safety Performance in the solicitation (EMR, Total Recordable Incident Rate, etc.)?<br><br>ANSWER: Not yet determined.
