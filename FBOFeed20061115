<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-08.

The Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Ohio State Office intends to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) to small business sources capable of providing real estate appraisals throughout the state of Ohio for a period of approximately three years.  A BPA does not obligate the Government to order or the vendor to furnish any articles of any quantity except to the extent that may be agreed upon in connection with individual transactions.  Obligation is made at the time of an actual order.

Appraisers shall be a State Certified General Real Property Appraiser or obtain a temporary practice permit in Ohio and be in good standing with the licensing authority where the credential was issued.  Appraisers must demonstrate competency in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) in conducting appraisals of agricultural properties with and without conservation easements of the requested type.  All appraisals completed for this program shall comply with USPAP, Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions (USAFLA aka Yellow Book) and Supplemental Standards as issued by NRCS.

USDA NRCS is also seeking sources capable of providing technical appraisal reviews of appraisals done by other vendors within the state of Ohio.  Review Appraisers shall be a State Certified General Real Property Appraiser and be in good standing with the licensing authority where the credential was issued.  The review appraiser must have demonstrated competency in compliance with USPAP in conducting appraisal reviews of agricultural properties with and without conservation easements of the requested type.  Documentation of appraisal education courses attended such as eminent domain or conservation easements and UASFLA course and at least 40 hours of training in conducting technical reviews shall be provided by the review appraiser to the authorized official.

This is 100% set-aside for small-business.  The associated NAICS code is 531320 and the small business size standard is $1.5 million in average annual receipts.

The provisions at FAR 52.212-1 and 52.212-2 apply to this solicitation.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: price: technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement; past performance (see FAR 15.304)

The clause at FAR 52.212-4 applies to this acquisition.  The clause at FAR 52.212-5 applies (attached).  Additional terms and conditions may be contained in the attached contract clauses.

Multiple awards will be considered.  We will use Optional Form 347 for the award document.  Task orders/delivery orders will be issued in letter form.

For planning purposes there are approximately 25 appraisals to be completed before September 30, 2006.  History for the last three years is as follows:  FY 2003-24 appraisals; FY-2004-21 appraisals; and FY 2005-24 appraisals.  Changes in the policy require the new appraisals be divided into two parts.  The firs part will be on the entire parcel (not just the WRP area) to appraise it for market value before the easement.  The second part of the appraisal will be on the whole parcel after the easement is in place, the after value.  Technical review will be conducted on the first appraisal from all appraisers and 10% of all appraisals after the first.  An in house administrative review will be conducted on all appraisals.

Interested vendors should reply in writing to the Contracting Officer listed below not later than April 7, 2006, 1:00pm E.S.T.  Offers should be addressed to the following:  USDA, NRCS, 200 North High Street, Rm. 522, Columbus, Ohio 43215, Attn: B. Clayton.  Place the solicitation number in the upper left hand corner of the envelope.  Quotes are requested for the following.

1)	Real Estate Appraisal-(Market Value-before value/worth of Property with Easement-after value). 1 JOB; 2) Technical Review 1 JOB

All deliverables are FOB Destination.

Include pricing for those types of appraisals that you are interested in performing.  (NOTE:  It is not necessary to bid on both items to be considered for an award.)  In addition, please provide: documentation of appraisal education courses attended, such as eminent domain or conservation easements, and Yellow Book course; the attached reference form for a minimum of three references; the counties or location preferences for appraisals; and, the counties or location preferences for review appraisals.  See Attachments 5 and 6.  Complete and provide the provision at FAR 52.212-3 along with  your offer.

Telephone and fax inquiries will not be honored.  Email all questions to Barbara.Clayton@oh.usda.gov Contracting Officer.

All contractors must register in the Central Contractor’s Registration database at www.ccr.gov.  The CCR Customer Assistance Center can be contacted toll free at: 1-888-227-2423.  The first step to registering is to obtain a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, which is a unique nine-character identification number provided by the commercial company Dun and Bradstreet (D&B).  To request a DUNS number call D&B at the toll free number 1-866-05-5711 or register on-line at http://www.dnb.com/ccr/register.html.  Obtaining a DUNS number through this process is free of charge.  It’s a good idea for anyone who is submitting a quote to begin this process as soon as possible since it can take several days to complete.  Failure to register by close of business on the third day after notification of possible award b y the Contracting Officer, may cause rejection of your offer.  Prospective contractors also must complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

<DESC>Junction Creek Fuel Reduction and Timber Removal.  Thin and remove vegetation on 117 acres on National Forest Service Land.  Conventional logging equipment would be used to thin ponderosa pine, thereby reducing the fuel loading, increasing the distance between tree crowns, and creating a more natural, clumpy structure.  Estimated volume is 446 CCF.  Approximately 1 mile of existing temporary road will need to be reopened and 1/4 mile of new temporary road construction will have to be built to remove designated products from the treatment area.  The solicitation for this project will only be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities website - www.fedbizopps.gov.  This project is set aside for small businesses.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits and Security Administration (EBSA) anticipates the release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) to the Information Technology (IT) vendor community in September 2006 for a wholly outsourced, turnkey IT system to be designed, developed, and operated by a private sector vendor under contract to the DOL. The purpose of the IT system, known as EFAST2, is to receive, process, store, publicly disclose, distribute, and archive approximately 1.1 million electronically filed Form 5500 Series filings submitted annually by the public over the Internet. Form 5500 Series filings (including Form 5500 and all schedules and attachments to these forms) are annual information returns that contain information on employee benefits plans, including both pension and welfare plans, and are required to be filed annually by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Form 5500 Series filings may contain Sensitive Tax Information and are therefore subject to commensurate security and handling protections. EFAST2 will allow filers to electronically file Form 5500 Series filings via a secure web portal. The Form 5500 Series electronic filings to be processed include structured data associated with forms and schedules, and unstructured data associated with attachments contained in PDF and text files. 

The Department requires this system to support a new mandate of electronic filing of Form 5500 Series filings, per the final regulation published in the Federal Register July 21, 2006. At this time, the Department estimates that the period of performance for this effort will run from contract award through December 31, 2008 for Base Period (Prototype Development and Production Scale-up), August 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008 for Option Period I (1st Component) (Advance Customer Support Activities), and January 1, 2009 through June 30, 2019 for Option Period I (2nd Component) through XI (Operations). 

EBSA anticipates seeking responsive proposals on the EFAST2 RFP (RFP DOL069RP20266) from firms that are capable of performing the work described in the RFP, which can be summarized as follows: 1) Designing, developing, hosting, and maintaining a secure, scaleable web portal that allows users to electronically file Form 5500 Series filings; 2) Providing a system based on Extensible Markup Language (XML) allowing filers to submit filings directly through the website or via approved third party software; 3) Checking all filings for accuracy and completeness using XML schema validation and edit tests, and quickly returning acceptance/rejection messages to the filer via email; 4) Allowing stakeholders such as plan administrators, plan transmitters, and software developers to electronically register and attain electronic filing credentials. The system will verify these credentials upon receipt of each filing; 5) Providing a public disclosure website that allows the public, Government, and vendor contact center staff to access, view, and download filing facsimiles over the Internet; 6) Providing a contact center and related customer support features to filers, software developers, and other stakeholders interfacing with the system; 7) Providing support to third party software developers that develop electronic filing software with which filers may complete, validate, and submit filings electronically. This support would include electronic filing technical specifications, technical support, testing, certification, and other ongoing support; 8) Managing all IT and related telecommunications equipment associated with the web portal; 9) Establishing and maintaining all required security on the portal based on varying degrees of access control and authorization, as well as physical, personnel, administrative, and computer security for the filing data, processing facility, and staff, including supporting Government conduct of a Minimum Background Investigation (MBI) for each assigned staff member; 10) Establishing an end-to-end tracking function that records the processing history and current status of all filing submissions received; and, 11) Meeting or exceeding the contractually specified timeliness and accuracy performance standards specified in the solicitation.

This solicitation will be available on or after September 1, 2006, and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration’s Federal Business Opportunities web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Hard copies of the solicitation document will not be available.  The site provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. Reference should be made to the issued RFP DOL069RP20266 for additional information on the contractual terms and conditions, performance standards, functional, security, and other related requirements.  Responsive proposals shall be requested and delivered to the Contracting Officer in accordance with the Technical and Business Proposal Instructions specified in Section L of RFP DOL069RP20266.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by this agency.  Please be advised that the official due date and time will be provided in RFP DOL069RP20266, and that only those responsive proposals received by the Contracting Officer shall be evaluated.  Interested offerors are requested to notify the Contracting Officer in writing via e-mail of their intent to respond no later than the date stipulated in RFP DOL069RP20266 to the following e-mail address: 
carrion.sonya@dol.gov

Offeror questions, requests for reference materials and additional information shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer in writing in accordance with Section L of the RFP DOL069RP20266 and no later than the date specified in the subject RFP DOL069RP20266. 

The NAICS Code identified for this requirement is 541511 with a size standard of $23,000,000. This anticipated RFP solicitation does not commit the Government to award of a contract.  If this solicitation is cancelled, Offerors are cautioned that bid and proposal will not be subject to a claim against the Government, nor shall the Government be held liable for any of these costs.  Award is contingent upon Congressional appropriation of a pending Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Bill and the availability of appropriated funds.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a requirement to purchase Stereomicroscope System for Leica EM AFS2 to include Microtube Embedding System EM AFS2 holder plate for microtubes 2ml and 0.75 ml Sarstedt Tubes? with screw cap, 100 PCS; Flo-through capsule and flat embedding system universal container, 10PCS; Leica EM AFS substitution-Capsule and flat embedding system with uv-polymerization equipment automatic freeze-substitution system for 115/230v, 50-60hz.from Leica Microsystems Inc., 2345 Waukegan Road, Bannockburn, Il 60015.  The NASA NIH Center For Three Dimensional Tissue Culture, located in the Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biophysics, is devoted to the transfer of technology from NASA Biotechnology Branch to NIR. In particular, its mandate is to disseminate novel technologies for the culture of tissues and cells to all NIB scientists. The Center, funded jointly by NICHD and NASA, features a novel Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) Bioreactor for maintaining and promoting both the original differentiated state of various tissues and the association and differentiation of isolated cells into tissue-like aggregates. Research groups use the Center facilities to supplement their main projects with experiments, which involve the techniques developed at the center. To evaluate tissue function, the Center is providing a facility for imaging, which includes image processing and transmission electron microscopy. Large data sets are produced by this microscopy.  The Leica Auto Freeze Substitution unit will be used to process cell and tissue samples for electron microscopy. It will afford the NICHD/LCMB the opportunity to view samples in a state more nearly resembling the natural as opposed to potentia11y deformed from the rigors of standard electron microscopy fixation, dehydration and embedding. It is important, in 3-dimensional visualization of molecular interactions in biological systems, to be able to process virus, cells & tissue without disrupting the interaction of macromolecules in situ. Since the system is automated, it is expected to result in savings of technician time. The Leica Auto Freeze Substitution unit is the only unit of its type which is completely automated. This automation will allow for sample production uniformity, thus saving time lost in trying to replicate by hand the exacting parameters of successful sample preparation.  It also has the widest variety of programming options, the largest sample capacity, and the most varied types of sample holders, of any available freeze substitution unit.  Should it be required, the programming also allows for manual processing should this be necessary. No other unit is as versatile as the Leica Auto Freeze unit nor can they come close to the time saved by the fully automatic configuration available in the Leica unit. All responsible businesses that are capable of providing the Government with the items that are listed above may request a copy of the Request for Quote (RFQ) in writing or by FAX to 301-480-8501 to the Contracting Office prior to the closing date of this notice.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 339111   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) with Steris, Inc for a one year service maintenance and (1) additional option year on 10 autoclaves (steam sterilizers), 1 ethylene oxide sterilizer, 1 ethylene oxide aerator, and 3 labware dryers.  Because these sterilizers handle the decontamination of infections waste loads at the AWBERC facility, including the Center's special BSL-3 Biocontainment Suite, timely maintenance and skilled repair of these units is critical for both the safety operation of the facility as  well as, for facility response readiness in the event of a national bioterrorist occurrence. The nature of the acquisition requires a contractor that possesses the unique capability of having factory (manufacturer)-trained technicians capable of reliably and safely servicing the complex and  hazardous equipment that is to be maintained.  This unique capability is essential for performance because autoclaves operate under pressure steam, and gas sterilizers use the highly toxic gas, ethylene oxide.  Human exposure to either uncontrolled high pressure steam or ethylene oxide can be  deadly. Moreover, all the sterilizers contain computer circuit boards and chips specific to the manufacturer that precisely control their operation. Repair of these electronic components demands the skills, knowledge, and ready authorized component access of factory-trained technicians. Steris is  the only known source able to satisfy the Governments requirements because it has factory-trained service technicians and replacement components needed to maintain the facility's sterilizers in operational status. This notice is not a request for quotations. EPA source research indicates Steris is  the only known contractor with the appropriate technology necessary to meet EPA's requirement.   However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting this EPA requirement may submit technical documentation to established the potential of completing such work.  Any such documentation must be  submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to  conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. The applicable NAICS Code is 339111.

The BPE in Nigeria requested U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) assistance to prepare its two largest power plants for privatization.  The proposed Technical Assistance would present the general design parameters and assess the required capital investment spending for the Shiroro and Egbin Power Plants over a three-year span.  This would include major overhauls of machinery and equipment as well as plant modernizations.  In addition, the project would develop the methodology to be used in the preparation of bid packages.  This methodology would be used as a hands-on tool in capacity building for employees of BPE, where the required skills are said to be in need of reinforcement.

(1) Project Preparation and Review

Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>MODIFICATION 0001: This modification is to correct the point of contact previously listed.  For questions or help DO NOT contact William Voitk E-Mail robert.wagner@noaa.gov or william.johnson@noaa.gov. or emwin.system@noaa.gov. (THIS ENDS MODIFICATION 0001). The United States Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to identify potential sources and products capable of enabling the public to receive and utilize NWS essential weather information.  It will allow the NWS to determine the interest of prospective manufacturers in designing, constructing and marketing systems for the reception of the Emergency Managers Weather Information (EMWIN) datastream or for software to make that information more valuable to EMWIN users.  The EMWIN satellite broadcast in its present form through the NOAA Geostationary Orbital Environmental Satellites (GOES) must undergo a change when the new generation of satellites is placed into service sometime on or before 2011.  Existing EMWIN receiving systems must be adapted or replaced to make the transition to the new satellite broadcast. The NWS wishes to identify and inform a community of vendors who have an interest in marketing low cost and reliable products capable of accommodating the transition.  Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government's needs are invited to submit an affirmative response.  All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including technical information sufficient to permit agency analysis. This RFI is issued by NWS solely for obtaining information and planning and does not constitute a solicitation.  Proprietary information must not be submitted and will not be accepted by NWS.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 15.202 (e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Furthermore, no basis for claims against NWS shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or NWS??s use of such information.  Affirmative responses should be submitted on or before December 04, 2006 via E-Mail to emwin.system@noaa.gov  No telephone calls please.

	     BACKGROUND 
What is EMWIN The EMWIN system is a popular dissemination system providing a serial bit stream containing timely watches, warnings, forecasts, hydro-meteorological products, graphics and satellite imagery. The EMWIN data stream is prioritized to meet the needs of emergency managers. EMWIN uses NOAA's GOES satellites and economical receive systems to disseminate and process this bit stream. L-band Satellite broadcast is accomplished via GOES-East and GOES-West and also rebroadcast in Pacific via PeaceSat.  In addition to L-band satellite broadcast, portions of the EMWIN data stream are also rebroadcast via VHF radio, in certain areas, and via the internet in its entirety via internet push technology.  Additional information may be found at http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/index.htm.
EMWIN Satellite Broadcast  

The current EMWIN broadcast modulation is Dual Frequency Shift Keying (DFSK) at a user data rate of 9.6 kbps.  The service is transmitted from the GOES satellites using an L-band down-link frequency at 1690.725 MHz.  Additional information may be found at the following address:  http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/WINSAT.HTM

What must change in the next series of GOES satellites, the GOES-N thru P constellation, have necessitated development of a service to be offered as a replacement and upgrade to the existing broadcast.  All current EMWIN users will need to migrate to newer technologies due to frequency, power and modulation changes.  In addition, EMWIN users and vendors have also stressed the importance of increasing the EMWIN data rate and keeping the cost of the GOES-N transition as low as possible.

	      PREPARATION FOR TRANSITION
EMWIN System Design & Specifications Working with NESDIS, the NWS has developed a system design and specifications for the use of prospective vendors. The next generation broadcast, EMWIN-N is a digital direct broadcast service with a frequency of 1692.7MHz.   The broadcast will be offset quadrature phase shift keying (OQPSK) modulation and convolutional rate 1/2 plus Reed Solomon forward error correction for additional gain. The user data rate will be 19.2 kbps. Details of the design and specification are now available at the following link:  http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/transition/EMWIN-OQPSK%20Specifications%20Final.doc.  
Proof-of-Concept Development To demonstrate the feasibility of a receiving system capable of meeting the new EMWIN system design, NESDIS has developed and constructed a proof-of-concept model system using hardware implementation for the intermediate-frequency (IF) conversion and a software-defined radio scheme for the demodulation. Detailed information on the proof-of-concept design may be found within the specification at http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/transition/EMWIN-OQPSK%20Specifications%20Final.doc.  It is the intent of NWS to make the Demodulation and Decoding software and the dynamic link libraries (DLLs) that were developed available to the public at no charge.  The software may be downloaded at http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/EMWIN-N%20OQPSK%20software.htm.  Vendors are free to develop any alternative scheme which meets the system design and specification criteria.
GOES-N Satellite The proof-of-concept model has been successfully tested using the GOES-N satellite. The results of these tests are posted on
http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/transition/EMWINtstReptGOES-N.doc. An EMWIN-N test broadcast will be available via the GOES-N satellite during the satellite test period which will last until approximately December 1, 2006. After completion of the check-out of the GOES-N satellite, it will be placed in storage until required to replace the generation of GOES satellites still in service. These older satellites will be replaced by the new generation on or before 2011, depending upon fuel consumption, premature failure or demand for capabilities only present in the new satellites. Before being placed into operational service, the GOES-N satellite will be activated each year for a test period.
            
Vendors who have an interest in submitting a capability statement or information please E-Mail to emwin.system@noaa.gov. E-mails will be used to develop a mailing list to be used by the NWS in disseminating additional information on EMWIN and the GOES satellite evolution as part of a list of those invited to participate in an EMWIN  RFI workshop to be held in Silver Spring, MD on December 11, 2006.  E-mail responses should include the following information: Brief description of firm and current similar product lines Firms URL Any questions Expression of interest in being on a mailing list and possible participation in a forthcoming workshop at Silver Spring, MD on December 11, 2006.
If possible, please submit before December 4, 2006.
An additional RFI workshop may be held in January, 2007.
Vendors who market EMWIN related products will be identified on a list of vendors posted on the EMWIN web site but without any endorsement by NWS.   

Additional information on the EMWIN program and transition may be found on the EMWIN website located at the following address:  http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/index.htm.

<SUBJECT>58 -- NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD IBS MODIFICATION
<SOLNBR>FA8707060001
<RESPDATE>121606
<ARCHDATE>01152007
<CONTACT>Joseph P. Pianese (781) 266-1035 Joseph.Pianese@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>This announcement serves as notice to all potential offerors that the 950th Electronic Systems Group, Electronic Systems Center, Hanscom Air Force Base, MA intends to solicit and negotiate with L3-Titan of Reston, VA to modify the existing contract, F19628-01-C-0033, for Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS). This modification will provide more stringent IBS capabilities through additional spirals and will extend the period of performance two (2) years at an estimated cost of approximately $28M. The modification is part of the existing contractual effort to provide Near Real Time (NRT) high priority intelligence to tactical users in a common format. Justification for this contract modification is FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The software development effort is deemed to be available only from the original source. The period of time required to perform a source selection, the ramp-up time required for a new contractor to become familiar with the program, along with technical issues would cause unacceptable schedule delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements for meeting operational milestones. These circumstances would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The initial contract awarded in May 2001 was planned as a four (4) spiral development effort. Spiral 1 provided Initial Capability (IC), Spiral 2/2A delivered capability to three (3) sites and resulted in the declaration of Limited Operational Capability (LOC), and Spiral 3, currently in process, will deliver Common Message Format (CMF) capability, increase the number of User profiles, and assure delivery of Priority III messages. The modification will provide the more stringent capabilities in order to meet the updated User requirements. The modernization will significantly enhance the warfighter's ability to obtain/provide the most recent intelligence information at the right place and at the right time. The primary focus of the IBS effort is to: (1) add a new site; (2) increase the number of User profiles per domain, (3) increase message throughput, and (4) support the Net Centric environment with a publish-and-subscribe interface. Interested parties that believe they have the requisite capabilities to perform this effort shall submit no more than a 10 page white paper detailing their capabilities as a primary software developer in a spiral environment as well as any relevant past performance to the Contracting Officer within 10 days of this announcement. Your submittal shall include a transition plan as to how you will continue development of the existing IBS system architecture while delivering a Spiral 4 capability in the 4QFY09. The transition plan shall include mitigation plans for developing your software development laboratory (to include SIPRNET access), and a staffing plan to indicate their ability to provide 100 TS/SSBI cleared personnel upon contract award. Other important information: (a) Past experience in the spiral evolution development of software, software development in a net-centric environment, and why you believe your company is capable of performing as a Prime Contractor, (b) Demonstrate your understanding of the problems that the IBS Contract must address and what potential risks you foresee that would preclude successfully achieving the objectives set forth above and (c) Demonstrated capability in the development of software in a multi-level classified  environment. Key competencies to be considered: systems engineering, program management, security management, logistics and test. Your submittal shall be on CD ROM in an MS Office compatible electronic format and on 8 ½ x 11 paper with one-sided pages, 12 pitch font and one inch margins to be delivered to 950 ELSG/PK, Attn: Joseph Pianese, 11 Barksdale Street, Bldg 1614, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731 no later than 1400 local time. Respondents must specify whether they are a U.S. or foreign-owned firm. Contractors are reminded and cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. Address all questions to the Contracting Officer, Joseph Pianese, 781-266-1035 or Mr. Richard Hartford, 781-266-1034. This synopsis is for information only, does not constitute an IFB or RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government. Please note: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within ten (10) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. See Note 26.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to the synopsis issued on 18 Oct 2006 (as modified on 19 October 2006) is to revise the produce description and to revise the source selection to full and open competition: The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to issue solicitation N00024-07-R-2214 for the development and production of a test article self deploying side port ramp system to demonstrate the transfer of vehicles between a surrogate Maritime Pre-positioning Force (Future) (MPF(F)) Mobile Landing Platform (MLP) ship and a side port platform on a Large Medium-Speed Roll-on/Roll-off (LMSR) ship.  The ramp/platform system is intended to operate through sea-state 3 conditions with a maximum load capacity of 160,000 pounds while the surrogate MLP is operating underway at 3 to 5 knots in a dynamic positioning mode approximately 100 feet off the port side of the underway LMSR.  The effort will include developing and testing the ramp system and any related modifications to the LMSR sideport platform.  The testing will be done with a GFE surrogate MLP and an existing LMSR.  The system is to be developed based on the offeror’s knowledge and experience with shipboard ramps and sideports capab!  le of at-sea operations through sea state 3.  The solicitation is anticipated to be released in December 2006.  Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should monitor FEDBIZOPS for the solicitation documents.

<DESC>This modifies the "Description" information, as such, the synopsis is modified to add the following:

For selection criterion (4), the Government will evaluate each firm’s past performance rating(s) from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System during the evaluation process, which can affect the selection outcome.
In support of the subcontracting plan requirement, A-E firms are advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contracts per fiscal year are 23% to SB, 5% each to SDB and WOSB, and 3% each to HUBZoneSB and SDVOSB concerns.  In addition, the NAVFAC PACIFIC FY07 subcontracting targets in terms of dollar value of subcontracts are 76.07% to SB, 15.88% to SDB, 14.22% to WOSB, 1.29% to HUBZone SB, and .13% to SDVOSB concerns.  Extent to which firms identify and commit to utilize small businesses (SB), small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), women-owned small businesses (WOSB), historically underutilized business zone small businesses (HUBZoneSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB) in the performance of this contract, whether as a prime contractor, joint-venture, teaming arrangement or subcontractor will also be considered.
A-E firms are reminded that in order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as SDB or HUBZoneSB either as prime or sub-consultant, proposed SDB’s and HUBZoneSB’s must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified SDB or HUBZoneSB by accessing the Central Contractor Registration at http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to correct and clarify CLINs in the Base Year and Options.  The following section is hereby replaced in its entirety on the OPM049-07-R-0004 Synopsis issued on October 27, 2006.  

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

The Federal Investigative Service Division (FISD) is a department under the Office of Personnel Management Investigation Service.  The Federal Investigative Service Division is responsible for conducting background investigations on employees of the Federal Government.   A steady stream of documentary correspondence between Boyers, PA, Washington, DC and Ft. George Meade, MD is essential in maintaining the smooth running operations of all facilities.  Timely and expeditious courier service between the three facilities is vital for FISD s overall mission. 

The Center for Retirement and Insurance Services (CRIS) which is part of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) maintains an office in Boyers, PA and Washington, DC.  CRIS is responsible for the initial processing of retirement, death claims, and final storage of all federal civil service retirement and insurance related records. A steady stream of documentation between Boyers, PA and Washington, DC facilities is essential in maintaining the smooth running operation of both facilities. A breakdown in this chain of correspondence could drastically incapacitate both the CRIS and FISD facilities.

The contractor shall provide dependable, secure, accountable and timely courier service as identified by each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) as listed.

<CONTACT>bmiller, 301-619-1078
<DESC>In support of continuing improvements in combat casualty care capabilities for the US military and ongoing Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom, the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) is interested in existing products or produc ts under development by industry and academia which may contribute to improved wound care and treatment.  A priority has been identified for fluid-based products for wound/burn debridement or irrigation with associated anti-infective healing factors.  The use of such products would occur at the forward surgery and theater hospitalization levels of combat casualty care, therefore packaging and configuration are a key component for potential candidates.  Potential products should address capabilities to remov e contamination, prevent infection, and allow for healing of battlefield wounds, and should offer an improvement over the existing capability - saline.  Wound types may include, but are not limited to, open abdominal wounds, large 2nd and 3rd degree burns,  and extremity wounds with large soft-tissue injury with or without bone fractures.  The USAMRMC is interested in these products and their capability to reduce rates of infection from open and burn wounds, total hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) days,  time for the fitting of prosthetic devices (when needed), the probability of second or greater surgical procedures, and mortality rates. This RFI seeks information from industry and academia that can demonstrate that they have the resources and capabilities to best support the continued development of such products and to obtain U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and/or cleara nce.  Promising candidates should have documented pre-clinical safety for the proposed indications.  USAMRMC strongly encourages small business participation either individually or as a joint venture team, consortium, or similar arrangement. USAMRMC will u se the information obtained from this RFI and other market research techniques to identify potential candidates that meet this requirement.  Note, this is a request for information (RFI), not a request for proposal (RFP), and does not signify that an RFP w ill be forthcoming on this topic.  Respondents may be contacted by the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command for additional information or discussions. Interested parties are requested to respond with the following information regarding their products no later than 30 November 2006 by 2:00pm: "	Name of the product "	Name of sponsoring and key partnering organizations "	Description of the product and mechanism(s) of action "	Description of the final formulation and packaging "	Summary of any potential limitations related to the final product, such as storage conditions, shelf-life, etc "	Proposed use or indications "	Proposed schedule and duration for use "	Claims to be made regarding product capabilities, and a summary of the supporting data "	Summary of the research and development effort to date, including any animal or clinical testing results, to support the proposed use/indications "	FDA regulatory status of product, including any interactions with the FDA Responses should be limited to 15 pages, including supporting documents, for each product.  All proprietary information should be appropriately identified.   Submissions will be accepted electronically by e-mail to brian.d.miller@amedd.army.mil and should use commonly accepted file formats, such as MS Office products or Adobe PDF. E-mailed submissions should include solicitation #09302006 in the subject line.

<DESC>NOTE: The text that follows is intended to replace the entire notice published November 22, 2005.

INTERMITTENT CONTRACTOR/SUBJECT-MATTER EXPERT (SME). Background: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates numerous international training and assistance programs in various countries throughout the world which address the entire range of customs and border control operations. To effectively implement these programs, there is a need to obtain the services of skilled and knowledgeable individuals (i.e., contractors) on an intermittent (short-term) basis. Short-term or intermittent is defined as a single assignment for 180 calendar days or less. Intermittent Contractors (ICs) will be required to perform various tasks such as those associated with training, utilizing specialized equipment, or to provide professional and technical assistance in specific topical areas. The following is a delineation of the types of general services that ICs are expected to provide under their contracts, as required. A more specific description of services or tasks shall be identified and provided to the ICs upon selection and award of an order/contract. 
       
TRAINING: The IC shall serve as a subject matter expert and/or presenter. He/she may be required to present customs or border control training based on an existing CBP curriculum. Instruction may include, but is not limited to, the areas of narcotics interdiction, port security, customs investigative techniques, money laundering, intellectual property rights, control of weapons of mass destruction, commercial import/export operations, or customs valuation. In general, the topic and contents of the course will be established, in advance, with course material normally provided by CBP. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training to serve as an instructor in general and in specific areas of instruction.

COURSE DEVELOPER: The IC shall develop a set of course materials on a given topic for later presentation by either CBP personnel or in-country advisors. Courses to be developed could be in any customs or border control-related areas such as those described for TRAINING above. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training in course development for one or more related areas.

ASSESSMENTS: The IC may conduct on-site assessments of customs administrations and other border control agencies located in foreign countries. Assessments may be general in scope or geared to specific areas (e.g., control of weapons of mass destruction, assessment of aviation equipment assets or of aviation programs, intellectual property rights, etc.). Tasks could include such actions as physical border surveys, and broader surveys of the entire governmental enforcement system. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the necessary experience and skills to complete an authoritative and professional review of the specific agencies or programs, and to prepare summaries, analyses, recommendations, trip reports, and/or other written work product(s).

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: The IC may provide technical assistance in highly specialized areas such as legal reform, inspectional technology (high and low tech), port security, or specialized field operations. For example, in the area of legal reform, tasks may include the review of customs laws and regulations of a country, making recommendations for improvements, and/or providing technical assistance in the preparation of new laws and regulations that meet the needs of a specific country. The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess specialized knowledge, experience, and background related to specific areas of expertise.

AUGMENTATION and REPLACEMENT: The IC may augment a technical team or temporarily replace a technical team member. As an additional team member, the IC will undertake general or specific tasks associated with various projects such as the development of an interagency taskforce or the review of personnel policies. As a replacement or fill-in, the IC may replace and assume the tasks of a technical team member who may be away from post for an extended period of time. The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess the necessary knowledge, experience, and skills to serve as an additional team member, or replacement member.

TERMS and CONDITIONS: Most IC assignments will be less than 30 days, with adequate advance notice given prior to assignment/deployment. Some IC assignments may last up to 180 calendar days. It is not envisioned that an IC would be on duty more than 180 days in a calendar year. If an IC declines more than two assignments, he or she may be excluded from further consideration at the discretion of CBP. 

POSSIBLE DUTY LOCATIONS: ICs must be willing and able to work in any country in which CBP conducts operations. CBP training and assistance projects are currently ongoing in all regions of the world.

COMPENSATION and OTHER REIMBURSEMENTS: 1) ICs will be compensated for their performance on a fixed-priced basis at the rate of $2,400.00 per week for all ICs or prorating thereof (i.e., $480.00/day, $60.00/hour), for the period of time estimated by CBP for completion of the assignment, excluding travel days. 2) All authorized hours worked will be paid at the above hourly rate. 3) There are no provisions for an overtime or premium rate. Work is generally to be performed during the normal workweek however, the Contractor may work on weekends and be compensated at normal hourly rate (i.e., $60.00) with the express authorization of the Contracting Officer and/or Program Manager. 
 
OTHER REQUIREMENTS: 1) Prospective ICs may be required to undergo updated background investigations to obtain a SECRET security clearance from CBP. If for some reason a clearance cannot be granted, the prospective IC may be excluded from consideration from any assignments calling for such clearances. 2) For some specific assignments, foreign language ability may be a requirement for selection. 3) All materials provided to or developed by the IC under a contract are the property of CBP, may not be released to any other party without express permission from CBP, and are subject to return to CBP upon conclusion of the contract or otherwise upon receipt of a request from CBP.

TRAVEL: All travel will be under U.S. Government travel orders (separate and apart from the contract) and in accordance with applicable U.S. Government travel regulations. ICs will be reimbursed for all official travel upon completion of a travel voucher in accordance with an approved travel authorization. The IC will be responsible for purchasing airline or other common carrier tickets subsequent to approval of travel. ICs are not authorized to receive an advance for expenses for lodging, meals and/or travel incidentals. The embassy will be making travel arrangements in country. Travel time to and from the United States is not compensable for pay purposes.

http://www.fbo.gov/spg/DHS-BT/USCS/PDDC20229/Reference%2DNumber%2DIC%2D2006%2D01/Attachments.html. 

In order to ensure that full consideration is given, applicants are encouraged to review the form OF-612, available at     http://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/of612.pdf. A copy of the 2002 version available at the above website at the time this notice was published is also available at FedBizOpps. Applicants are encouraged to review the information and topics covered on the OF-612 form and ensure that their resumes contain the same data elements that appear in that form. Applicants should NOT use the form OF-612 for the purpose of submitting an application, however.

Resume packages (i.e., resume & completed questionnaire) will be accepted by e-mail only. 

APPLICANTS ARE TO SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATIONS AND RELATING DOCUMENTS TO: 

CBP.IC@dhs.gov. 

DO NOT SUBMIT TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICE STAFF. No acknowledgement will be made by CBP upon receipt of the resume. Please, no phone calls. 

NOTE: Applicants who applied previously are to submit new application packages in accordance with the guidance and requirements herein, to include a completed questionnaire.

METHOD of SELECTION/OPERATION, INSURANCE and PHYSICAL EXAM REQUIREMENTS: The CBP Office of International Affairs will evaluate the resume and questionnaire packages received for technical ability. CBP may exclude any applicant from consideration if it is unable to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of his/her qualifications from the documents submitted. Qualified and otherwise acceptable candidates will then be added to a Qualified Bidders List from which ICs are selected and may be awarded an order/contract for one or more assignments in the future as needs arise. Prospective ICs must be physically fit, able to perform the duties of an assignment and may be required to obtain a physical examination and certification that they are fit for travel anywhere in the world for assignments up to 180 calendar days. If selected for a contract award and CBP elects to require that the prospective IC obtain a physical, CBP will reimburse the IC for reasonable actual costs (not to exceed $500.00) by including this item on the order/contract, as described above. ICs may be required to obtain emergency evacuation insurance coverage. If so, the order/contract document will provide for reimbursement of reasonable actual costs for this coverage (not to exceed $500.00). 

REQUIRED REGISTRATION @ WWW.CCR.GOV: Prospective ICs must be registered in the government CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR) system at www.ccr.gov prior to issuance of an order/contract. CBP strongly recommends that applicants complete their registration as soon as possible after submitting an application. The process involves input of business information and registration with Dun and Bradstreet to obtain a D&B number.

ORDER/CONTRACT DOCUMENT: As indicated above, once CBP identifies a requirement and selects a prospective IC, a CBP Contracting Officer will prepare a suitable order/contract document in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (i.e., FAR, viewable at     http://www.acqnet.gov/far/ ). The contract document will contain the detailed statement of work for the specific assignment, including services required, estimated time required, country/destination, travel dates, materials and topics to be addressed, and other applicable information. 

ORDER ISSUANCE, COMMENCEMENT OF PERFORMANCE, ORDER CEILING: Applicants selected for an assignment and contract are not to commence performance or initiate travel until they receive and accept an order/contract in writing. The duration of contract performance shown on the contract document and resulting dollar amount constitutes a ceiling, beyond which the IC performs at his/her own risk. If needs arise which call for the IC to provide services for an additional period of time, the Contracting Officer will issue a modification which provides authorization for continued performance within specified limits.

ORDER/CONTRACT INVOICING and PAYMENTS: Payments are processed by CBP in arrears, in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act as implemented by FAR clause 52.232-25. ICs are to submit an invoice for services rendered under their contract no more frequently than once per month (in arrears), unless otherwise specifically authorized in the order/contract document.

<DESC>The purpose of this SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is to abtain information from potential contractors if they can provide data network system equipment that will support the Advanced Range Telemetry (ARTM ) upgrade program. This equipment will be integrated into the ETTC telemetry acquisition systems and airborne instrumentation ground stations. The current ETTC Range Telemetry consists of five fixed sites and one mobile Telemetry Van. Each site receives eight to twenty-four PCM telemetry data channels and four to eight NTSC video streams. Each site's data protocols are OC-3, OC-12, and Ethernet. Under the ARTM initiative, each site will have one to four OC-3 and OC-12 connections and one gigabit Ethernet connection. The NTSC video is sent in a low latency uncompressed serial format over fiber optic cable to the Central Control Facility (CCF). All of the telemetry data is sent by optical carrier to the CCF. The Ethernet connection is used for out of band configuration and remote control of the instrumentation at each site. The Ethernet is also used for down loading any data stored at the sites. The new ARTM data network equipment must be fully compatible with existing equipment and allow for expansion to include additional future telemetry sites. Transport of the ARTM data must be error free and fault tolerant. This new network must simultaneously support ATM and Ethernet and allow both Permanent Virtual Connections and Switched Virtual Connections. The system must have trouble shooting capability down to the circuit card level. The system must also have a quality of service and self monitoring for failures and other error conditions.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY--FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.   This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e) for Military Sealift Command (http://www.msc.navy.mil.)  MSC does not presently intend to award a contract, but seeks information on the existing capabilities on Maritime Satellite Communications (SATCOM) as a potential Next Generation Wideband (NGW) Initiative.
The Military Sealift Command is the sea transportation component of the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) and is the Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force (NFAF) for the United States Navy.  The mission of MSC is to provide ocean transportation of equipment, fuel, supplies, and ammunition to sustain U.S. forces worldwide during peacetime and in war for as long as operational requirements dictate.  There are currently one hundred and ten (110) operational civilian mariners - crewed (CIVMAR) ships.  Seventy-two (72) of the vessels have their voice and data networks connected to the shore via the MSC Bandwidth Efficient Satellite Transport (BEST) Wide Area Network (WAN) infrastructure.  The MSC BEST satellite infrastructure provides the following features:

Centrally managed ship-specific uplink guaranteed bandwidth  allocation (non-shared, 256kbps maximum).

Ship-specific dynamic data rates set up in the return (uplink) direction through the Bandwidth Management Counsel (BMC) Server located at each Stratos Land Earth Station (LES) or through the Remote User Interface (RUI) Client located at each MSC Point-of-Presence (POP).

(Ship-specific uplink data rates are prepared in advance via transmission plans which are then applied as required.)

(Shared broadcast downlink.)

(Frame over satellite network architecture.)

(Utilizes leased International Maritime Satellite Organization (INMARSAT) L-Band generation II four (4) satellite constellation.)

(24x7 connectivity for all end user terminals at fixed cost.)

(Out-of-band management to BEST infrastructure devices.)

The primary objective of the Next Generation Wideband (NGW) initiative is to evaluate current and near-future maritime satellite technology for applicability as a replacement/upgrade for the existing MSC Afloat BEST satellite infrastructure.  The result of the evaluation will be an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) that will be the basis for the engineering and deployment of a new MSC SATCOM fleet solution.  The initiative is necessitated by BEST infrastructure end-of-lifecycle and capacity shortfall factors.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The due date for contractors to submit their Qualification Submittals for evaluation is 28 November 2006, no later than 2:00 P.M. Central Standard Time. The Solicitation Number is N40083-06-R-3002.

SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENT FOR EVALUATION/SELECTION:   (1) Provide proof of the Small Business Administration?s (SBA?s) 8(a), Hub Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned  Small Business (SDVOSB) Certification; (2) Registration in the Department of Defense?s Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database; (3) Any applicable licenses; (4) Letter from the Offeror?s surety stating Offeror?s bonding limitations and capability to perform service work under the NAICS Codes 562212 & 562111; (5) Provide up to three references of completed service projects within the last three years that reflect your firm?s performance and qualifications similar in size,  general scope and complexity to the requirements listed (Recycling Tonnage:  1300 tons of paper and cardboard per year, 180-200 tons of metal, 300 pounds of cans, 1 ton of plastic and 25-30 tons of pallets).  Submittals are due by 28 November 2006, no later than 2:00 P.M. Central Standard Time.  The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-West, Great Lakes, IL is seeking interest from 8a firms, Hub Zone and/or SDVOSB concerns.  The Government reserves the right to go unrestricted if unable to obtain adequate competition among these specific small business groups.  The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-West, is currently seeking potential sources for a combination firm fixed price (FFP) and indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contract with a base period of twelve months and four (4) one-year option periods. No single option period will exceed 12 months or one year.  The Contracting Officer, when awarded on a best-value basis, will consider factors such as price and past performance.  The specific work includes refuse/waste collection and disposal at non-residential facilities, remove and dispose of medical waste in accordance with all Federal, State and Local regulation and provide a secure disposal site (off Government property) for the disposal of solid waste, grease waste, asbestos, white goods and a composting facility for landscape waste that was collected and hauled from NTC Great Lakes Naval Complex 3 at Great Lakes and installations in Northeastern, IL by a combination of a  Firm-Fixed Price and Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract.

1.  The Contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, management, tools, materials, equipment, facilities, transportation, incidental engineering, and other items required to provide services for both refuse collection and recycling as described in thee Performance of Work Statement (PWS) at Naval Station, Great Lakes, and IL.  The services to be performed shall include, but not limited to, collection and disposal of solid waste, resulting from residential, industrial, commercial and community activities; removal, collection, processing and marketing of recyclable material, as well as report tonnage spent for recycling;  and collection and composting of landscape waste.  White Goods (such as refrigerators, freezers, ranges, washers, dryers, etc.) are included in this specification, the collection, processing and disposal will be ordered under Indefinite Quantity Spec Item 4 (EMALL).  These operations shall be performed in accordance with Section H or on a task order in accordance with the Procedures for issuing orders clause in Section G.

2.  The contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, tools, material, transportation and equipment and materials (including a ladder for access to trailers) required to perform refuse collection, disposal and recycling; to manage and dispose of Medical Waste; and to secure a site for the disposal of Landfill Waste (25 mile radius of installation) such as grease waste, asbestos waste, white goods, to include a composting facility for landscape waste collected and hauled from Naval Station Great Lakes, by Government Vehicles.  The bidder who is awarded the contract shall have access to landfills and/or transfer stations that ?ARE NOT? legally prohibited from accepting the refuse requirements of this contract, which are gathered from the state of Illinois.  The state of Wisconsin has imposed legal restrictions on the disposal of Illinois solid waste.  Therefore, disposal sites located in Wisconsin cannot be utilized for disposal of Illinois solid waste during the base period and all option periods.  Although some aspects of these restrictions were invalidated by the seventh circuit court of appeals in 1995, the court suggested a means by which restrictions could be imposed so that it is not clear whether Illinois waste can be accepted for disposal in Wisconsin.

The Small Business Size Standard is $11,500,000.00.  Best Value Source selection procedures will be utilized in conducting this competitive negotiation, which will consist of the submission of price and technical proposals once the Request for proposal is issued.  Anticipate the solicitation will be released on or about 26 December 2006.

<CONTACT>Kathryn Gonzales at 850-235-5354 , or Contracting Officer Mary Hines at 850-235-5389.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center-Panama City, Florida  (NSWC-PC) is interested in working with a manufacturer to potentially procure and field a Diver Information Display & Integrated Communications Facemask (hereinafter referred to as “the system”) for US Marine Corps combat divers. USMC Combat Divers conduct underwater combat swims as a method of troop insertion. Operations are conducted at night in zero visibility conditions using the MK-25 UBA (Draeger LAR-5) in shallow water (typically 0 – 20 FSW). Training may be conducted using Open Circuit SCUBA in depths to 190 FSW. To augment the divers’ insertion capability, a 2-man Diver Propulsion Device (DPD) vehicle is employed. The Diver Information Display & Integrated Communications Facemask will provide enhanced operational capability, and increased dive team safety and mission success. The system should provide full facial coverage (full facemask form factor) and integrated underwater voice communications (diver-to-diver secure, and thru-water to surface support) for enhanced protection from cold, and increased dive team safety. The system should provide the diver with a visual display of his Depth (in feet), Time (stopwatch function - in seconds), and Bottle Pressure (selectable in either PSI, or BAR) – readable regardless of environmental conditions. The diver should have direct control over visual display brightness/illumination levels. Internal power for the system should be COTS user replaceable batteries and should provide a minimum of 6-hours operation. The system should also be able to provide the diver with a visual display of high-resolution, color graphical imagery (such as navigational maps) from an external source (such as an underwater tactical navigation unit).    The US Marine Corps is interested in procuring and fielding between 400 - 600 systems within the next year. Candidate companies should have experience in the manufacture of military diving equipment. Other areas of experience and expertise should ideally include the design, fabrication, and integration of electronics, microprocessors, digital displays, head-mounted displays, and optical systems.     Responses to this announcement should include a technical description and detailed characteristics.  The system descriptions should have enough information for the Government to make informed decisions.  Information submitted shall be marked with restrictive legends as deemed appropriate by the potential offeror. Interested firms should respond to this Sources Sought Announcement on or about 15 December 2006.   The point of contact for this action is Mr. Dennis Gallagher, Code S13, NAVSEA, NSWC-PC, 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City, Florida 32407, PH (850) 235-5417, FAX (850) 234-4671, E-mail: dennis.g.gallagher@navy.mil, FSC 4220, NAICS:  334511, Size Standards:  750 employees.   This is not a solicitation. In the event a solicitation is developed, it will be assigned a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) number and the announcement will be published in the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) and Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps).

<DESC>This notice is issued by the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program, Subsonic Fixed Wing Project as a Request for Information (RFI) on innovative yaw control concepts for subsonic aircraft.   This RFI is for planning purposes only.  Interested parties are invited to submit ideas and creative approaches for research and development of innovative yaw control concepts.  The information received through this RFI will be utilized by NASA to assist in formulating research plans and preparation of a possible competitive solicitation to be released in FY 2007.  Responses to this RFI are not, and will not be considered proposals to provide services.  This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of any government assessments.	No awards will be issued as a result of this RFI.  Objective: There is broad interest in innovative flight control effectors that break from current design paradigms and offer lower weight, volume and cost, with increased aerodynamic efficiency, while providing comparable lateral/directional stability and higher reliability than existing approaches that utilize an empennage, vertical surfaces, or high drag producing devices such as spoilers or drag brakes.  NASA is looking for innovative approaches to provide yaw control for subsonic aircraft that are applicable to the broad range of large transports and smaller unmanned aerial vehicles concepts each with blended-wing-body planforms.  The yaw control concepts should be effective from take-off and landing speeds up to high subsonic cruise Mach numbers.  The measures of merit for the effector concepts include control effectiveness at all flight regimes, system compatibility (weight, power, volume), minimal perturbations to the aircraft outer mold line, high reliability, low maintenance and operational cost, and a technical path to mature the concept to a flight demonstration level.

<DESC>THE LANGUAGE CORPS OVERVIEW

The National Security Education Program, a DoD organization aligned with the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness), in response to the President?s National Security Language Initiative, is seeking to identify potential sources:  (1)  to complete development of an operational plan for the establishment of The Language Corps and (2) conduct a three-year pilot program demonstration of The Language Corps.  

BACKGROUND  
The Department of Defense (DoD), working in close coordination with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and other federal departments and agencies, recognizes the need for short- and long-term requirements for professionals with proficiencies in foreign languages. Establishment of The Language Corps addresses this need and is a part of the Language Transformation Roadmap approved by the Secretary of Defense in 2005.  Additionally, operationalization of The Language Corps Pilot concept is identified as a vital component of the President?s National Security Language Initiative announced in January 2006.  

SCOPE--About The Language Corps.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Multi-Well Sample Plate Cover Penetration System for Automated Reagent Mixing and Aspiration
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY

Multi-Well Sample Plate Cover Penetration System
for Automated Reagent Mixing and Aspiration

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to commercialize its multi-well sample plate cover penetration system for automated reagent mixing.

Background: Automation platforms employ sample arrays that need access but must be protected from well-to-well cross contamination. Current accepted standard laboratory protocols are concerned with a proven cross contamination vector of the plate-sealing-tape removal process. The tape is currently peeled back from the entire plate by hand, generating adhesive strings that cross wells, aerosolize solvents and analytes, and can contaminate other open wells. Additionally, the manual tape removal process can jostle the wells, spilling and mixing products into adjacent wells. Currently, to circumvent these issues, much slower and more time consuming processes are performed instead of tape sealing such as removal of samples from the plate and processing with individual capillary tubes which is a tremendous disadvantage in both time and expense. Or, entire rows and columns are left unused to reduce sample proximity, which doubles the number of plates required and similarly increases the analysis time.

Description:  LLNL?s multi-well plate cover penetration system is an array cutting and tape folding tool, based on 96-well, 384-well, and 1536-well geometries, that can be robotically operated and will cut, open, and fold inward the sealing tape so that samples can be subsequently aspirated without the need for human intervention to remove the seal which is an aerosol generating and contaminating process). To view a diagram of the system go to: http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/technology/profile/announcement/MultiWellSamplePlateCover.php

Advantages:  This device will eliminate cross contamination and automate another step in the experimental protocol, improving accuracy while reducing both time and expense.

Potential Applications:  Common multi-well formats include 96-well, 384-well, and the new 1536-well plates that are utilized in research, academia, and industry. Uses for LLNL?s multi-well plate cover system include bench-top automated reagent mixing and analysis systems such as those used for bioterrorism analysis, clinical and medical diagnostics, genetic analysis and sequencing, drug discovery, protein crystallography, biological engineering, environmental monitoring and analysis, biological and chemical research, and forensics. 

Development Status:  A patent application has been filed. A marketing prototype is under development for evaluation. 


LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Multi-Well Sample Plate Cover Penetration System for automated reagent mixing should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Buyers and Sellers understand that FedBid ranks all bids by price; however, pursuant to applicable acquisition regulations and/or departmental guidelines, Buyers may use criteria other than price to evaluate offers.  Accordingly, please note that, unless otherwise specified herein below, to the extent required by applicable regulations and/or guidelines, award will be made to the responsible Seller whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Buyer on the basis of price, technical capability, delivery, and past performance. <BR><BR>The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions. FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The selected Offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items.

If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Dell Optiplex GX620 minitower workstation.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST has identified the Dell Optiplex GX620 minitower workstation as a key component for overseas Consular offices.  The Dell Optiplex GX620 minitower was selected for this purpose because of the results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. to replace a like number of older PCs used overseas in Consular offices. The Dell Optiplex GX620 workstation is able to support the overseas and domestic standard configurations and run Consular Affairs applications with associated peripherals. The workstation meets all of the Consular Affairs minimum hardware requirements. The Dell Optiplex GX620 (MT) workstation features a BTX (balanced technology extended) chassis, power supply and motherboard that are designed for thermal efficiency, improved reliability, and quieter operation.  Dell's chassis design provides tool-less access to the system and components for quick service.  In summation, CA/CST believes that the Department’s best interests will be served if the Dell Optiplex GX620 minitower Workstation is procured at this time.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Dell Optiplex GX620 minitower workstation has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board <BR><BR>

<DESC>This is intended as a sole source to Audio Visual Innovations, however, any interested parties should contact GSA Contracting Officer, Cindy Cwiklinski, 817-978-0662, cindy.cwiklinski@gsa.gov, if they can comply with the Statement of Work.

STATEMENT OF WORK
PROVIDE VIDEO CONVERSION AND SWITCHING

FS7070003T1

The FEMA RRCC, Region 6, Denton TX office has a requirement for the conversion and switching of their existing video system.  The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain design services and turnkey installation of a video upgrade that will allow the addition of video capability to the RRCC.

Presently all video coming out of the switching matrix is in RGBHV format. There are six video monitors through out the RRCC that have the capability to accept the RGBHV signal, however, there is no way to switch the video to control signal input to them at the present time. The software that operates and controls the computers and video equipment, via the Battle Command Information System, utilizes custom software that contains priority code exclusive to Audio Visual Innovations.

Scope: The scope of this project requires the selected contractor provide and install equipment as follows:

1)	Remove two single output RGBHV video cards from the Vizion Computer
2)	Add two double output RGBHV video cards to the Vizion Computer
3)	Each RGBHV output from the Vizion computer will be connected to a 1 in/4out Distribution Amplifier (DA) (three new DA)
4)	The two new outputs from the Vizion computer that will be going to 1 in/4 out DA will be connected to three monitors in the RRCC and one in the Blue Room
5)	Provide five cat5 TX-RX devices for more computer inputs to the existing RRCC A/V system
6)	Add one 8x8 composite video matrix
7)	Add two outputs to the projectors back as inputs to the existing video matrix switch
8)	Wrap outputs to the projectors back as inputs to the existing video matrix switch
9)	Provide all necessary cabling for any added equipment
10)	 Clean up existing installation to acceptable standards
11)	 Program the Madero panels and the AMX (netlink) controller for the addition of:
a.	The new 8x8 video matrix switch
b.	Use the wrap around outputs and inputs
c.	Control of the eight monitors
i.	One Pioner PDP-V502X
ii.	Three View Sonic N0460W
iii.	Four unknown at this time
d.	Use of the two new NTSC inputs to the Vizion computer
e.	Use of the five new inputs to the existing video matrix switch
  12)  At completion of installation the source code is to be provided to FEMA

Contraints:

1)	Installation must be completed without disruption to the Region VI staff.  In the event of RRCC activation, installation will cease immediately and the video switching matrix must be returned to a useable state.  During construction, the existing switching matrix cannot be taken off line without prior approval from the contracting officer

2)	The FEMA Region VI compound is a secure area.  Personnel requiring access must be identified prior to arrive.  Twenty four (24) hour notification must be provided to the Project Officer.  Personnel must have photo identification produced by a US State or Federal Agency on their person when they arrive.  Such as State Drivers License or Passport.  Foreign produced identification will not be accepted with the exception of a valid passport.

3)	The contractor must maintain all required certifications, bonding, and insurance required by Federal and state regulatory agencies for this industry.  Certificate of insurance must be provided prior to any work being done in the facility.

4)	The contractor must be in compliance with all OSHA safety regulations during contract performance.

5)	All work schedules must be approved by the FEMA Project Officer.


Award:  Will be best value based on technical acceptability and price.

Accordingly, please note that, unless otherwise specified herein below, to the extent required by applicable regulations and/or guidelines, award will be made to the responsible Seller whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Buyer on the basis of price, technical capability, delivery, and past performance. <BR><BR>The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions. FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition.

If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Dell Optiplex GX620 minitower workstation.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST has identified the Dell Optiplex GX620 minitower workstation as a key component for overseas Consular offices.  The Dell Optiplex GX620 minitower was selected for this purpose because of the results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. to replace a like number of older PCs used overseas in Consular offices. The Dell Optiplex GX620 workstation is able to support the overseas and domestic standard configurations and run Consular Affairs applications with associated peripherals. The workstation meets all of the Consular Affairs minimum hardware requirements. The Dell Optiplex GX620 (MT) workstation features a BTX (balanced technology extended) chassis, power supply and motherboard that are designed for thermal efficiency, improved reliability, and quieter operation.  Dell's chassis design provides tool-less access to the system and components for quick service.  In summation, CA/CST believes that the Department’s best interests will be served if the Dell Optiplex GX620 minitower Workstation is procured at this time.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Dell Optiplex GX620 minitower workstation has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board <BR><BR>

Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity

any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest
of national security.

Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except

`at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of
section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign
corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an
inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?

properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the
properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former
partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in
the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not
have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of
which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of
such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when
determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted
domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity
as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining
ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign
incorporated entity; or
 (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition
described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C.
395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or

(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some internal forums.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
