<DESC><p>This is a sole source requirement to IHS Global (cage code: 6A920). A requirement exists to contract for services necessary to support the Air Force Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS) parts configuration data conversion activities.&nbsp; This effort is for the conversion of indentured parts records contained in Illustrated Parts Breakdown (IPB) documents for uploading to the Parts Configuration Management System.&nbsp; To reduce the percentage of errors during the conversion process, an automated rules processor will be utilized.&nbsp; The automated rules processor will use source data from Haystack, a commercially owned logistics database owned by IHS Global. IHS is the only source capable of performing actions necessary to clean-up Master BOM data in a timely manner, which is fundamental for successful implementation of ECSS.&nbsp;The validation&nbsp; of the captured IPB data is an automated process that compares data for thousands of parts with those from the Haystack source database and updates the captured IPB data if discrepancies are founds.&nbsp; The validataion process via the rules processor requires access to source data from Haystack for a complete database of up-to-date parts information.&nbsp; This internal source code, which manages and interfaces the source database to its external applications, is the intellectual property of IHS Global. The Government will be setting up an IDIQ contract with a two (2)&nbsp;year ordering period&nbsp;with IHS Global for this requirement. This will not be a recurring&nbsp;requirement.&nbsp;Questions regarding this requirement should be sent to&nbsp;Brandi Morris at <a href="mailto:brandi.morris@robins.af.mil">brandi.morris@robins.af.mil</a>.&nbsp; Email responses are preferred.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

Project background:  In late summer 2008, Hurricane Ike decimated a large portion of the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge along the Southeast Texas coast.  A previously existing bridge that originally crossed the East Bay Bayou was completely removed from the site during heavy flood and rain activity during the hurricane leaving only the oringal pilings and abutments following the storm.   Currently, visitors to the Refuge are not afforded access across the Bayou as in the past.  Remaining structure items consisting of pilings within the bayou that impede water flow during heavy rainfall and rising water levels are currently being removed by others.
Project Overview:  Specific requirements for this project shall be outlined within the statement of work within the solicitation documents and shall include, but is not limited to, design and construction of a pre-cast or cast-in-place free-span concrete bridge system including approach rails and abutments over the East Bay Bayou on the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge.  Type of construction selected for the bridge system shall be based on the most economical type to accomplish the requirements outlined within the specifications.  Site work to remove existing bulkheads will be required prior to the installation of the new bridge system.  Photographs and drawings of the existing site will be provided upon the release of the full solicitation package.  Span of bridge is approximately ninety-six (96) feet.
In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36.204, the magnitude of this project is between $250,000 and $500,000.  The North American Industry Classification Code for this Requirement is: 237990, Other Heavy Engineering and Civil Construction with a small business size standard of $33.5M.  The Product Service Code is: Y222, Construct Highways-Roads-Streets-Bridges.

THE SOLICITATION WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ONLY.  Offers will NOT be accepted from businesses that are not Small Business Concerns.
The total combined contract capacity under the umbrella contract is valued at $2.5 million dollars.  $500,000 for the base year and $500,000 for each option year should the options be exercised.  The contract will be for a one year base with four one-year option periods for a total of five years.  Up to Three (3) contracts can be awarded under this umbrella contract.

Each task order will be competed between the up to three (3) successful offerors.  Competition will be based on "Best Value" or Low Price. Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505.
Yellowstone National Park is searching for a professional gillnet and trapnet fishing operation to remove lake trout from Yellowstone Lake. The work is to bolster the existing lake trout suppression program of the National Park Service. The fishery activities must be tailored to remove the non-native lake trout while minimizing mortality of the native Yellowstone cutthroat trout.

Either the same boat or a second boat, including captain and crew, must be equipped to handle setting, lifting, retrieving, and moving deep water trapnets (30-50 ft in height).

The evaluation factors in order of importance will be Company Regional Experience, Lake Trout Removal Operations and Methodology, Past Performance, Key Personnel and Safety.  When combined, the Technical Proposals will be significantly more important than price.  The solicitation will be issued on or about 19 October 2009 and proposals will be due on or about 18 November 2009 and award is anticipated by December 2009.

Two delivery orders will be solicited in the initial solicitation and utilized to determine who will receive award of the basic contracts.  The two delivery orders will include a contract line item for first articles and a contract line item for production units.  The award decision will be based on technical go/no go, past performance, and price.  Technical go/no go will be evaluated on the Contractors ability to propose on both delivery orders and technical information that is required by the solicitation; past performance will be evaluated on the Contractors ability to demonstrate past experience on similar requirements.  Delivery requirements will be in accordance with the delivery terms outlined in each individual delivery order.  Delivery will be FOB Destination, NSWC-Crane, Crane, IN 47522-5000.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - Z - The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for public construction and is soliciting written expressions of interest from qualified Design/Build contractors desiring to compete in the procurement process for the referenced project. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 236220. The size standard is $33.5 million per year. This is an unrestricted procurement open to all large and small business concerns. This procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (FAR 52.219-19).
<p>All firms shall submit a one page letter of interest on company letterhead. This letter shall include a statement of interest, number of personnel that will attend the pre-proposal conference and the firm's DUNs number Letters and certification are due to the office of the Contracting Officer no later than September 15, 2009. Send documentation to General Services Administration, Attn: Carrie Haman, Contracting Officer, 819 Taylor Street, Room 12B01, Fort Worth, TX 76102, or carrie.haman@gsa.gov. GSA retains the right to publish and distribute the list of offerors to other interested parties (i.e., subcontractors, etc.). The estimated contract value is $80,000,000 to $100,000,000. Funds allocated via www.recovery.gov reflect funds for the entire project and not just design and/or construction. Contractors should price according to the specifications. The Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is scheduled to be issued on or about September 15, 2009, via FedBizOps (http://www.fbo.gov/). Firms must send the letter of intent to gain access to the documents. A site-visit and Pre-proposal conference for Phase I is tentatively scheduled to be held on or about September 29, 2009, in Houston, Texas to answer questions that offerors may have concerning the project and technical evaluation criteria. Attendance at the Pre-proposal conference is not mandatory but is strongly encouraged. GSA intends to contract for complete design and construction services with the design/build contract that offers the best overall value to the Government by demonstrating a commitment to design and construction excellence, by providing and maintaining a viable team organization and by adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration proposes major structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing upgrades to Houston's 26 year-old, twenty-two story U.S. Federal Building. While there are many work items, the following are especially significant. They include:</p>
<p>Replacement of the exterior building envelope with a new curtain wall system attached to the outside of the existing building structure; significant improvements to the outdoor plaza, installation of a new covered breezeway and garage improvements; retrofit of structural deficiencies discovered during the due diligence phase in design development; interior upgrades inclusive of finish and ADA upgrades at all non-compliant restrooms, first floor upgrades; significant improvements to the HVAC system; lighting controls to maximize energy efficiency opportunities created by improved day lighting within tenant space resulting from the new curtain wall and HVAC improvements. LEED Project certification is required with LEED Silver being the project goal.</p>
<p>The offeror selected shall be required to supply all labor, materials, equipment and supervision to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract. The contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing FAR Part 36.3 Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and Part 15 Source Selection procedures using the Best Value/Trade-off process. Based on the complexity and importance of this project, the Government deems it to be in its best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror. Therefore, combined technical evaluation factors will be significantly more important than cost or price. The final price will encompass all-inclusive costs for the entire design and construction project including the administrative cost of processing change orders throughout the course of this project. The Government anticipates the award of a Firm Fixed-Price Contract (see FAR Part 16.202); based on a final negotiated or accepted price, to the contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government. The procurement process will be performed in two (2) phases. The successful offeror will be based on accumulative scores for both phases. Phase I Submission Requirements: Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for technical documents from those firms responding to this FBO announcement. Any scope changes by the Government that result from the pre-proposal conference or any other discussions may be incorporated into the Scope of Work at any time prior to the final request for price proposal submission (Phase II) at no recompense to the offeror(s) ?. The technical factors for Phase I RFQ are tentatively as follows: (#1) Construction Firm Past Performance and Experience on Design/Build Projects; (#2) Design Firm Past Performance and Experience on Design/Build Projects; and (#3) Key Personnel Experience and Past Performance. Following the evaluation of the technical proposals, a competitive range of offerors that offer the best value will be selected in accordance with FAR Part 15.306(c) to further compete in Phase II. Any and all cost saving concepts and scope improvement measures submitted or discussed by the offerors as part of Phase I, or II shall become the property of the Government and may be incorporated into the drawings and specifications for use under this project at no recompense to the offeror(s). Phase I submittal requirements are due into the office of the Contracting Officer on or about October 15, 2009. Phase II Submission: Only firms selected within the competitive range will enter into this phase of the solicitation.</p>
<p>The technical factors for Phase II Request for Proposals (RFP) are tentatively as follows: (#1) Design Incorporating Approach and Project Approach; (#2) Preliminary Project Schedule. Price proposals and a Subcontracting Plan (if the offeror is not a small business concern) will also be required during Phase II. This procurement is open to small and large business concerns. Before award of the contract, the business concern (if not a small business concern) shall be required to present an acceptable, proactive Subcontracting Plan, pursuant to FAR Part 19.7. GSA's Socio-Economic Program goals are below, but contractors should develop their own goals with these in mind: Small Business (36%), Small Disadvantaged Business (6%), Small Women-Owned Business (5%), HUBZone Business (3%), Veteran-owned (5%), and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned business (3%). Failure to submit and/or comply with the minimum requirements of the Subcontracting Plan will render the offeror unacceptable. Phase II submittal requirements are due into the office of the Contracting Officer no later than close of business on or about January 6, 2010. GSA shall schedule two site visit opportunities during this Phase. All questions and clarifications regarding the project documents (drawings, specifications, procedures, etc.) shall be put in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer no later than close of business December 22, 2009. Production costs and proposal preparation costs are at the expense of the offeror.</p>
<p>All correspondence in response to this announcement must clearly indicate the Solicitation Number GS-07P-09-UY-C-0008. This project is being funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY THAT FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. Reporting requirements from the contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) is continuously looking to improve the quality of the production materials used to produce US currency and to promote competition for these materials. One such material is rigging boards which are used for the intaglio printing presses.
<p>A rigging board is an impression material used at the BEP for its intaglio presses that is typically a paper board product constructed with cellulosic materials. However, other materials such as synthetic fibers or a mixture of synthetic and cellulosic fibers may also be considered in construction of the rigging boards. On press, rigging boards are subjected to temperatures up to 93o C and printing pressures of up to 2.5 tons per linear inch with a service life of 250,000 impressions. Approximate length &times; width dimensions of the rigging boards range from 24 &times; 25 to 30 &times; 33 inches with calipers ranging from 0.020 to 0.060 inches. For more detailed information and requirements please refer to the attached rigging board specification.</p>
<p>This is a future sources sought with no guarantee, implied or not implied, that any actual requirement will be established. Potential future sources are encouraged to review the specification and submit a company profile including business size classification. Based upon responses to this notice all interested potential contractors will be encouraged to attend an Industry Day at the BEP. Industry Day will consist of a guided tour of the facilities with a technical question and answer period and discussion to educate potential suppliers of the BEP's potential future requirements pertaining to rigging boards. The discussion will be on quantity/quality of rigging boards, type of rigging board, shipping information, etc. If there is insufficient interest from potential rigging board vendors, making an Industry Day impractical, the BEP may schedule individual tours. In lieu of attending the above Industry Day or an individual tour a sample product may be submitted for a pass/fail assessment. Interested parties are cautioned that developmental testing will only be scheduled based on availability of the Bureau's resources.</p>

<DESC>NASA/LaRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for the design,development and build of an inflatable reentry vehicle test article for the InflatableReentry Vehicle Experiment (IRVE)  3 Project.Recent systems analysis studies are showing that inflatable aeroshells are an enablingtechnology for high mass Mars systems. On August 17, 2009, the IRVE-II project (with a2.96m (116.5in) inflatable aeroshell) was launched on sounding rocket out of WallopsFlight Facility, with a goal of demonstrating the concept of inflatable reentry vehicles.During the IRVE-II flight, the aeroshell inflated as designed and maintained stabilitynot only through hypersonic reentry but also through the supersonic, transonic andsubsonic flight regimes.  With this IRVE-II proof-of-concept demonstration, a nextlogical step would be a flight test to increase the heat flux on the inflatable (to getcloser to a more operationally realistic flight environment).NASA LaRC, in conjunction with the Fundamental Aerodynamics Program Hypersonics Project,has initiated IRVE-3 which will build on both IRVE-II and ongoing ground-baseddevelopments, with a primary goal of 5X to 10X higher heat flux than IRVE-II.  IRVE-3will be launched on a Black Brant XI with a 22in (0.55m) shroud.  The target ballisticnumber of the reentry vehicle is double that of IRVE-II, so the payload being deceleratedby the aeroshell will be roughly 200kg (441lb) more than the mass allocated for theaeroshell.  Preliminary estimates of the peak deceleration are on the order of 25g (andthis is the value to be used for preliminary aeroshell/payload interface loading).Sources are being sought for design, analysis, fabrication, integration, and testingsupport of an inflatable reentry vehicle test article for IRVE-3.  After integration andsystem testing, the inflatable article will be hard-packed for launch and remain in astowed configuration for several months before launch, inflation, and reentry.Components of the inflatable reentry vehicle will include: Inflatable Structure, ThermalProtection System, Insulator Material, Restraint System, and Instrumentation. Proposalswill be accepted as a system, or individual components.   All components of the systemshall be constructed of materials that are radio transparent.  If some component isradio opaque, it shall be a small enough portion of the deployed aeroshell system areaso as not to interfere with the vehicle telemetry system (which will use an s-bandfrequency transmitter with an omni-directional wraparound antenna).  Note that fornominal conditions, the aeroshell is between the antenna and ground receiving dishnetwork.Responses will be judged based on the following criteria for the components of thearticle:Inflatable structureThe vendor shall provide an inflatable structure with the following attributes:	Geometry: 	3.00 +/- 0.01m (118.1 +/0.4in) in diameter (inner diameter of 0.381m (15.00in));60 deg half-angle cone (+/- 5 deg).  Shoulder radius maximum of 0.051m (2.00in).  Notethat based on our on-going in-house studies, we do not desire isotensoid or tension coneconfigurations for hypersonic applications.	The inflatable structure shall have sufficient rigidity when inflated to maintainits flight shape in near-zero gravity while performing attitude control maneuvers.  	The inflatable shall be pressurized with lab-grade clean, dry nitrogen.	Maximum expected operating pressure (MEOP):	138kPa (20psig).	Proof pressure of 1.5X MEOP required.	Burst pressure of 2X MEOP required.	Higher pressure capability will be judged more favorably.	Leak-rate: 	At 138kPa gage (20psig) internal gauge pressure, 7.1 standard liters per minute(slpm) (0.25 standard cubic ft per minute [scfm]) or less in vacuum and 28.3slpm(1.0scfm) or less at sea level static (SLS) pressure (IRVE-II 116.1slpm (4.1scfm) atSLS).	Lower leak rates will be judged more favorably.	Maximum atmospheric entry load: 	Support 8kPa (1.16psi) uniform pressure distribution on forward surface of coneand negligible pressure on aft surface.  	While under 8 kPa uniform pressure distribution, shall maintain at least 95 percent of drag area of unloaded shape.  	Maximum expected operating temperature:	A 250C (482F) for short duration (~10 sec at peak temperature).  	To provide a safety factor, the bladder should be capable of surviving peaktemperatures on the order of 300C (572F) for that same duration. 	Higher temperature capability will be judged more favorably.	Mass: 	Inflatable structure shall have a maximum mass of 22.5 kg (49.6 lb), includingbladder, fill lines, and structural attachments to center body. 	Lower mass systems will be judged more favorably.	Packing:	Inflatable structure shall pack for flight as described below in SystemPerformance section.	Damage Tolerance:	The Bladder shall demonstrate tolerance to damage (e.g., puncture) withoutcompromising structural integrity (i.e., limit or prevent damage propagation)	The inflatable structure shall provide inflation lines and pressure sense linesfrom the inflatable volumes in the structure to the centerbody with an interface to bespecified by NASA.	Strain sensing instrumentation may be incorporated on the structural bladder(s),if available.Thermal Protection System (TPS)The vendor shall provide a TPS with the following attributes:	Flexible TPS shall be constructed of multiple layers.  	Outer high temperature fabric (current concept: two plies Nextel BF20; alternatematerials under consideration include Refrasil UC100, Nextel AF14, and custom-weavesilicon-carbide cloth).	Insulating layer (current concept: two plies Aspen Pyrogel 3350; alternateconcepts include other PAN fiber needled felt composites).	Gas barrier (current concept: two plies polyimide film; alternate conceptsinclude single ply of arimid reinforced polyimide film and expanded Teflon Polyimidefilled composite film).	The flexible TPS shall be quilted in a pattern (to be prescribed later) toprevent misalignment of the plies relative to each other and relative to the underlyingstructure.	The flexible TPS will be anchored to the underlying structure at multiplediscrete points (quantity and locations to be worked after contract award with thestructure and TPS vendor(s) in concert with NASA team).	The same layup shall be used on the rigid nose and the deployable cone.	The target composite mass for the TPS (nose and deployable) is 25.0kg (55.1lb).Responses with lower mass will be judged more favorably. 	Responses indicating fabrication experience with these or similar materials willbe judged more favorably.Rigid Nose TPS	Flexible TPS shall cover and attach to the vehicle nose cap and shall haveaccommodations for four thermal flux gauges (currently slug calorimeters) measuringsurface heat flux, and have approximately 24 embedded thermocouples to take measurementsbetween each ply.  Nose cap geometry is a 60deg sphere cone as shown in Figure 1. Attachment method of TPS to nose cap to be developed by vendor (current conceptual designis a clamped restraint around max diameter).	TPS vendor shall be responsible for integration of the TPS to the rigid nose capstructure.	TPS vendor shall be responsible for integration of thermocouples between thelayers of the flexible TPS nose cover.Deployable Cone TPS (protecting the inflatable structure):	The TPS shall cover the deployable cone from beneath the rigid nose transition tobeyond the deployed maximum diameter (see Figure 2).	In the event the TPS and Inflatable Structure are manufactured by differentvendors, the TPS/Inflatable Structure Interface shall be developed after contract awardby the joint NASA/Vendor(s) team. 	In the event the TPS and Inflatable Structure are manufactured by differentvendors, the TPS vendor shall be responsible for integration of the TPS to the inflatablestructure. 	TPS vendor shall integrate approximately 48 thermocouples embedded in theassembly at approximately 12 locations with a thermocouple between each ply.Insulator MaterialThe insulator material vendor shall provide an insulator material with the followingattributes:	The insulator shall be able to survive at least three hard packs. (A hard pack,which involves bending, creasing, and compressing the material, is a vacuum bag process,where materials are under approximately 101kPa (14.7psi) load.)  After each hard pack,the material shall regain original form without degradation to the material (such as anybreakage, cracking, ripping, or deformities resulting in localized thickness variationswhich change the insulative properties of the material).  	The insulator material shall be thin and flexible, with a maximum thickness of 2mm (0.079 in).	Thinner materials will be judged more favorably.  	The insulator material shall have a conductivity value lower than 0.15 W-m-K(0.0867 Btu/hr-ft-deg F).  	The insulator material shall be able to survive at temperature greater than 500C(932F) for at least 90 sec.  Higher temperature capable materials will be judged morefavorably.  	When handled, the insulator material shall not particulate significantly suchthat the material performance is degraded.  	The insulator material shall not be primarily ablative in nature.  That is, theprimary mechanism of temperature management should not be based on estimating ablativecoatings thicknesses.  The fabric substructure should be able to manage and survivewithout ablative coatings.If different vendors supply the TPS and insulator materials, the two vendors shallcollaborate to integrate the insulator material into the overall TPS component. Restraint SystemThe vendor shall provide a restraint system with the following attributes:	The restraint system shall secure the inflatable in the stowed configurationduring ground handling, testing, and launch. Launch loads as specified in the SoundingRocket Payload Handbook for a Black Brant XI launch vehicle.

The restraint system shall have provisions for applying balance weights tocorrect any imbalance the stowed aeroshell system. Discrete balance weights of up to 2kg(4.4lb) may required in multiple locations.	The target mass for the restraint system without balance masses is 3kg (6.6lb). Responses with lower mass will be judged more favorably. Instrumentation systemsThe vendor shall provide a sensing system compatible with the flexible inflatablestructure and/or TPS.  Desired measurements include but are not limited to:	Thermal Flux	Temperature	Surface Pressure	Strain	ShapeCombined System RequirementsThe components shall work together as a system to achieve:	Packing density of at least 400kg/m3 (25 lb/ft3) in conical shape defined inFigure 3.  Higher packing density capability will be judged more favorably.	Minimum system mass.General expectations of the contractor will include:	Performing structural analyses on delivered hardware (load set to be developedwith NASA). 	Performing coupon load testing to verify design performance in relevantenvironment as predicted by NASA analyses.	Participating via telecon in weekly team meetings.	Presenting design analysis and testing results at the formal project designreviews notionally scheduled below.

<DESC>TITLE: SECURING THE CITIES SUPPORT MARKET RESEARCH
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP or Broad Area Announcement (BAA). Furthermore, those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback with regards to its submission; other than acknowledgment of receipt - IF a request for an acknowledgement is requested by the submitter. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. DHS DNDO is not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), as part of its responsibilities under NSPD-43 and HSPD-14, is developing options and recommendations for strengthening the global nuclear detection architecture against radiological and nuclear (rad/nuc) threats, including those within the maritime domain. Previous DHS/DNDO studies identified several gaps in the maritime pathways architecture for detection of nuclear weapons and radiological materials. Using the Securing the Cities (STC) Initiative as an "early phased deployment" for the Port of New York/New Jersey (NY/NJ), DNDO and regional partners have been developing analytically-based detection architectures specific to that port. Vulnerabilities in the anti-terrorism force protection, "defense-in-depth," for the maritime approaches to New York City (NYC) (with emphasis on Lower Manhattan) require a continued analysis of options designed to encounter, detect, identify, and interdict illicit rad/nuc materials. This systems engineering approach will support the development of a robust, maritime Preventative Rad/Nuc Detection (PRND) capability, to include the planning, organization, equipment, training, exercise, and operational support (POETE/Ops) infrastructure. Additionally, when the NYC effort concludes, the next city that may be selected for the STC effort can use the maritime architecture developed in the NYC area to help guide its efforts to close any maritime PRND gaps that may exist in that city.</p>
<p>PURPOSE OF THIS RFI</p>
<p>Through this RFI, DNDO is seeking market information to determine the capabilities in meeting STC Maritime program goals.</p>
<p><br />1. General formatting should include 12 point font, single spaced, single-sided 8.5 x 11 inch paper, with 1-inch margins. All submissions must be made electronically (as described below), and be in either Adobe PDF or Microsoft Word. Supplemental data and brochures are not required or desired.</p>
<p>2. Cover Page (1 page)</p>

The igniter assembly will be used to initiate propelling charges in large caliber artillery systems. The laser igniter assembly must be tolerant of high shock loading (~6,000Gs axial direction, ~ 2,000 Gs lateral direction) and extreme temperatures(-50C to +130C). The selected Offeror will be required to demonstrate full performance, repeatable and reliable laser igniter assembly operation with initial manufactured production run test articles when being exposed to the high shock and high temperature environments. Typical operational constraints for the diode laser igniter assembly are available drive current of 60 - 100 amps (60-70 amps preferred), available drive voltage of 150- 200 Volts,  20 - 30 joules laser output energy,  5-15ms pulse width, 0.1Hz duty cycle and an output wavelength range from 750nm to 2000nm.  Life expectancy is typically 10,000-20,000 pulses total over a period of several months to twenty years (i.e. system could be very active or could be idle for very long periods of time).  The maximum laser beam exit diameter should not exceed 5mm  nor have a beam waist smaller than 5 mm  nor exceed 10mm  at a distance of 1 meter. The physical package size is 22 mm (diameter) X 110 mm long (maximum).  The laser igniter assembly will be located within a confined space and in intimate contact with cannon breech parts so it must tolerate the overall temperature excursions of the weapon with no active cooling measures. Low level pulses or low current throttling of the laser igniter assembly is the preferred method for heating the laser igniter assembly when required at the extreme cold temperatures.  The Offeror will be required to demonstrate the capability to manufacture 10 fully functional laser igniter assemblies per day.  The selected Offeror will be required to deliver initial manufactured production test articles to the Government for Government planned testing and evaluation.  The selected Offeror will be required to evaluate and analyze the results from the Government planned testing and provide and demonstrate corrective actions/process improvements performed, as necessary. 
Interested Offerors shall be required to have extensive expertise, facilities and prior experience with manufacturing, testing and verifying performance of high temperature diode laser bars. High temperature diode laser bars shall be defined as operating above +100C with an efficiency of 25% or higher without applying active cooling. Interested Offerors shall be required to have expertise, facilities and resources, required for manufacturing, testing and verifying diode pumped laser igniter assemblies at the required manufacturing rate of production.  A summary of the personnel skill levels, equipment, and facilities to include technical knowledge, experience, and areas of expertise relevant and necessary for conducting this effort shall be included in the interested Offerors response. Above information shall be provided in the Offerors response at no cost to the Government.
The Government will need to verify and confirm the performance of high temperature diode laser bars that the Offeror intends to use in the manufacture of the diode laser igniter assembly prior to considering the Offerors response to a formal solicitation/request for proposal.
All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government; information provided will not be returned.  Responses should be limited to no more than twenty (20) pages. All responsible, interested Offerors are encouraged to submit their capabilities / qualification data and any pertinent information via email, or electronically, No LATER THAN October 27, 2009.  TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The Government will accept written questions by email.

Award is subject to the availability of funds.<br /><br />The solicitation number is 2009-N-11534and this is a request for proposal.<br /><br />The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-36.<br /><br />The position solicited is a Global Funds Coordinator in Mozambique.<br /><br />Area of Consideration<br /><br /><strong>Only United States citizens, who are not permanent residents of Mozambique,&nbsp;are eligible for this position. <br /></strong><br />Security Clearance: OPM National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI)<br /><br />Period of Performance<br /><br />The period of performance shall consist of one base period plus option periods for a total not-to-exceed 60 months.

Non-U.S. citizens must obtain Medical Evacuation Insurance which is 100% reimbursable. <br />c. The contract shall be a Personal Services Contract (PSC) under the authority of 42 USC 242l(b)(8).<br />d. Post Cost of Living Allowance, Post Differential, and Danger Pay rates, if any, as provided for in this contract may fluctuate. By signing a contract, the Personal Service Contractor agrees to be compensated based upon the then-current rates of these overseas allowances and differential for all U.S. Government civilian employees assigned to your location of assignment, as approved by the U.S. Department of State's Office of Allowances. These overseas allowances and differential may increase, decrease, or even be eliminated altogether during the life of the contract.<br /><br />Description/Work Statement<br /><br />Purpose:<br />The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund) is a part of the U.S. Government's long-term strategy to provide financing to enable developing countries to respond to the challenges of these three diseases. The United States Government (USG), as a founding member of the Global Fund and its first and largest donor, continues to play a leadership role in ensuring the success of this important international effort. Since 2004, there is increasing availability of funds through both Global Fund and bilateral mechanisms for comprehensive preventive, diagnostic, and curative services from USG in the three disease areas, as well as in systems strengthening (e.g., human resources) which are both key areas of support for the Global Fund and USG. As of May 2009, the Global Fund has approved nearly $220 million in the three disease areas and disbursed $135 million in Mozambique; Mozambique is currently applying for additional funding in future rounds. In the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Program alone, USG has contributed more than $750 million dollars since 2004 and is expected to provide more than $1 billion in funding in the next five years.
<p>This dramatic increase in funding has required a concomitant need for the coordination of funding between these two principal funding streams. The USG interagency team in Mozambique recognizes the importance of strong coordination between Global Fund and USG bilateral resources to ensure optimal efficiency and effectiveness of programs and activities. To achieve this goal, USG Mozambique requires a Global Fund Coordinator with dynamic coordination and strong leadership skills. Working in close coordination with the PEPFAR Coordination Office and staff from other health programs, the Global Fund Coordinator develops and strengthens coordination and communication mechanisms between Global Fund activities and other USG efforts in Mozambique to ensure maximal effectiveness of all USG health programs.</p>
<p>One of the many ways in which USG supports Global Fund grants is through technical assistance both through broad bilateral efforts as well as central mechanisms to strengthen grant management. Recently, the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) has initiated a program that would place a Global Fund "Coordinator" in selected U.S. missions, with the objective of facilitating the coordination and synergies of Global Fund grants with U.S. Government HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs, as well as supporting and strengthening the implementation of Global Fund grants at the country level.</p>
<p>The Global Fund Coordinator, hereafter referred to as "incumbent", would assume responsibility for coordinating critical communications between and participation among various USG departments and agencies (USAID, CDC, State, DOD, etc.) in supporting various efforts related to the Global Fund portfolio in Mozambique. As this position would need to liaise closely with USG technical staff working on program implementation in support of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, this proposed position would function as part of an interagency USG team and be physically located at CDC (which is co-located in the same building as USAID).</p>
<p>Because this position involves cross-cutting activities in multiple programs and encompasses multiple agencies and departments, the incumbent would report to Senior USG leadership in health programming. With USG now having a decision making seat on the Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM), the coordination mechanism for the Global Fund activities in country, incumbent will report to the USG CCM representative (currently CDC Country Director, with USAID Health Team Lead as back-up). CDC, as the employing agency, will manage administrative requirements (personnel files, formal evaluation procedures, payroll, security clearance, etc.). <br /><br />General Principles<br />o Incumbent is the primary point of contact within the USG team to facilitate and communicate issues related the coordination between Global Fund and the USG in terms of planning and implementation of activities in the funded areas.<br />o Incumbent is expected to serve as the principal Coordinator on behalf of USG to the various principal recipients of Global Fund funding, including various relevant Ministries (Ministry of Health, Ministry of Women and Social Action), the National AIDS Council, and Civil Society. <br />o This position will need to liaise closely with USG technical staff working across agencies on program implementation in support of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria; therefore, this proposed position would function as part of an interagency USG team. <br />o The USG Mozambique team has an internal Global Fund Task Force of interested and relevant technical staff members to improve internal communication and coordination on issues related to Global Fund grants. The Coordinator will assume responsibility for coordinating and running these routine meetings as well as setting up the agenda, preparing relevant documents and hand-outs for meetings, and producing and disseminating minutes of meetings. The Coordinator will be accountable to ensure this group meets regularly and work towards achieving overall objectives. <br />o With USG now having a decision making seat on the Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM) the incumbent will report to the USG CCM representative (currently CDC Director, with USAID Health and HIV/AIDS Team Lead as back-up). Should the USG CCM representative change to no longer be the CDC Director, incumbent will continue to report to the USG CCM representative but receive formal supervision from the CDC Director.<br />o The Ambassador/Chief of Mission heads the in-country foreign assistance program and is the final decision maker under PEPFAR Guidance for all program plans and activities submitted to the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator for approval. S/he sets the overall policy context within which the representative to the CCM supervises the incumbent.<br />o Incumbent is a facilitator, a communicator, and at times, a negotiator. Incumbent is, in general, not a technical director, although incumbent on occasion will be expected to participate in and/or communicate technical issues of relevance to the USG and the Global Fund. <br />o Incumbent is responsible for preparing documents and communication related to Global Fund performance and/or USG-Global Fund coordination to internal and external audiences in a timely fashion. Internal audiences shall be limited to USG participants, including USG agencies represented in Mozambique, in particular staff working in the PEPFAR Program, the President's Malaria Initiative, USAID-funded TB Country Assistance Program (TB-CAP), and other HIV- and health-related programs supported by the US Government. External audiences shall include host country government partners and stakeholders, non-governmental implementing partners, multilateral partners and, less frequently, the host country's media and general public.<br /><br />o Principal Duties:<br />o Coordinator with USG point persons (1) in-country including the HIV, TB and malaria focal points; (2) with U.S. Government point persons at headquarters, including the USG Global Fund Focal Point; and (3) the Global Fund Portfolio Manager and other donors and stakeholders. 25%</p>
<p>o Coordination of USG support for proposal development. 15%</p>
<p>o Support the senior USG officer representing the USG on the CCM. 10%</p>
<p>o Collaborate with civil society representatives to build civil society capacity to access increased Global Fund resources. 10%</p>
<p>o Coordinate training of USG staff regarding Global Fund processes and policies, and communicate Global Fund policy changes to USG staff as appropriate. 10%</p>
<p>o Coordinate USG support for technical assistance to the Ministry of Health, the National AIDS Council, and other principal recipients for improved management and monitoring of Global Fund programs. 10%</p>
<p>o Identify technical assistance needed to reduce bottlenecks and improve Global Fund performance. 10%</p>
<p>Participate in site visits and grant monitoring activities to strengthen implementation, ensure accurate reporting, and identify technical assistance needs. 10%<br /><br />Selection Factors:<br />The applicant that represents the best value to the Government will be considered for award. To determine best value, the following factors will be considered:<br />1. The extent an applicant meets the minimum and desired qualifications based on information obtained through the application package and interviews, if conducted. Note that interviews may or may not be conducted; therefore, the application package should clearly identify how well the applicant meets the minimum and desired qualifications of this position. Interviews, if conducted, may be either in-person or via telephone.<br />2. Information collected from reference checks. References will only be verified for those applicants determined to have a reasonable chance of being selected for award.<br />3. Results of a cost assessment. The cost assessment will determine the total cost (salary plus benefits and allowances) of the applicant for the complete term of the contract (base period plus any option years).<br /><br />Basis for Award<br />In determining best value, paramount consideration shall be given to technical merit (applicant qualifications and reference checks) rather than to cost. In cases where applicants are determined to be essentially equal, then cost may become the determining factor.</p>

A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 General Description<br />The objective and scope of this work is to provide specialized engineering training to General Engineers (801 series), Mechanical Engineers (830 series), and Aerospace Engineers (861 series) within the DCMA Aeronautical Systems Division (ASD) community. The Service Provider (SP) will develop and conduct the training courses. This will be a firm fixed price level of effort. <br />2 About DCMA and the Aeronautical Systems Division<br />DCMA is the Department of Defense (DoD) agency responsible for working with the Defense industry to help ensure that systems, supplies, and services are delivered on time, at projected costs, and meet performance requirements. This involves managing 300,000 prime contracts valued at approximately $1.2 Trillion. <br />DCMA is headquartered in Fairfax County, Virginia (with a mailing address of Alexandria, VA), and employs approximately 10,000 civilian and military professionals worldwide. The agency is organized into six divisions: Aeronautical Systems, Naval Sea Systems, Ground Systems and Munitions, Space and Missile Systems, International, and Special Programs. The Aeronautical Systems and Naval Sea Systems Divisions headquarters are co-located with each other in Boston, MA. The Ground Systems and Munitions, and Space and Missile Systems Divisions are co-located with each other in Carson, CA. The International and Special Programs Divisions are co-located with the agency headquarters in Alexandria, VA. The divisions are further subdivided into 50 Contract Management Offices (CMOs) with over 800 employee duty stations worldwide, working with over 16,000 Defense related firms.<br />The Aeronautical Systems Division is organized into product-aligned sectors: Fixed Wing, Propulsion, Rotary Wing, Sustainment and Non-Aviation, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. In addition to sectors, the Division includes Directorates for Aircraft Operations, Technical and Contracts. There are 18 major subordinate Contract Management Offices (CMOs) that are grouped into their respective sectors.<br />3 Training Tasks<br />3.1 Develop Training Materials<br />The SP shall create training materials for five (5) training courses defined in Appendix A. The training shall be delivered as traditional instructor-led (classroom) training; materials shall include, but not limited to, syllabus, text book(s) and lecture notes associated with the specific subject matter of each course. Quizzes shall be used to supplement classroom training and to measure student comprehension of the subject matter being presented. Pre and post training surveys/evaluations shall also be developed and are considered part of the training materials. The training evaluations will meet or exceed level 2 evaluation criteria on the Kilpatrick Training Evaluation Scale <br />The SP shall work with the primary contracting officer's technical representative (COTR) to obtain concurrence of the training materials before conducting training.</p>
<p>Expectation: Deliver high quality training materials. <br />Standard: All materials are prepared in a clear and concise manner, properly formatted, spell checked, and grammatically correct. All training materials are delivered to the COTR for review and approval prior to conducting training and within 45 days of contract award. <br />Assessment: Review of training and instructional materials by DCMA COTR to verify content.<br />3.2 Conduct Training<br />The SP shall conduct training at various government locations throughout the continental United States (CONUS). Each training session shall be conducted by one or more instructors holding one or more advanced engineering degrees from an accredited college or university. Instructors shall have a extensive hands-on experience in the application of their subject material in the aerospace industry. Each training session shall be conducted for a class size not to exceed 30 students. Each of the five (5) training courses defined in Appendix A shall be held at least twice during the period of performance (a total of 300 student seats shall be provided). The SP shall provide class rosters and training surveys/evaluations to the contracting officer's representative (COR) at the conclusion of each training session. DCMA will provide the SP with access to computer and network hardware and software necessary to fulfill the classroom training requirements of this PBSW. <br />Expectation: Conduct high quality training. <br />Standard: Achieve a 90% or satisfactory or better ratings from post training surveys/evaluations.<br />Assessment: Review of post training surveys/evaluations by COTR.<br />4 Delivery of Training Materials <br />The SP shall provide each student with a copy of training materials including text books, lecture notes and other items as deemed appropriate by the SP at the beginning of each training session. <br />5 Periodic Adjustments to Performance Standards<br />In its experience with other performance-based instruments, DCMA has sometimes found it necessary to adjust performance standards. That is because written expressions of performance standards sometime inadvertently motivate service provider behaviors that are actually counterproductive to achieving the desired performance objectives. DCMA accordingly reserves the right to adjust any or all performance standards in this PBSW, including additions, deletions, substitutions, or modifications, at any time, subject, of course, to the stipulations in the "Changes" clause of any contract in which this PBSW is included. DCMA, however, does not plan to make any such adjustments. <br />6 Place of Performance<br />The places of performance shall be as follows: for the development of training materials - the SP's location; for conduct of training - various government locations throughout the continental United States (CONUS). <br />7 Period of Performance<br />The period of performance is one year after date of contract award, but not to exceed September 30, 2010, with multiple one-year option periods.</p>
<p>8 Travel: <br />The SP will provide funding for its own travel; DCMA will provide funding for its students. <br />9 Time of Performance.<br />Classroom training periods are restricted to normal business hours (Monday through Friday, 0800-1700 local). Work will not be performed on federal holidays - http://www.opm.gov/fedhol/index.asp.<br />10 Service Provider <br />The Service Provider (SP) shall be an regionally accredited engineering university by the U.S. Department of Education or a component thereof, and instructors shall have one or more advanced engineering degrees in their subject matter or after normal duty hours<br />11 Invoicing.<br />Invoices shall be submitted electronically via the Wide Area Workflow payment process.

These overseas allowances and differential may increase, decrease, or even be eliminated altogether during the life of the contract.<br /><br />Description/Work Statement<br /><br />Purpose:<br />The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund) is a part of the U.S. Government's long-term strategy to provide financing to enable developing countries to respond to the challenges of these three diseases. The United States Government (USG), as a founding member of the Global Fund and its first and largest donor, continues to play a leadership role in ensuring the success of this important international effort. Since 2004, there is increasing availability of funds through both Global Fund and bilateral mechanisms for comprehensive preventive, diagnostic, and curative services from USG in the three disease areas, as well as in systems strengthening (e.g., human resources) which are both key areas of support for the Global Fund and USG. As of May 2009, the Global Fund has approved nearly $220 million in the three disease areas and disbursed $135 million in Mozambique; Mozambique is currently applying for additional funding in future rounds. In the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Program alone, USG has contributed more than $750 million dollars since 2004 and is expected to provide more than $1 billion in funding in the next five years.
<p>This dramatic increase in funding has required a concomitant need for the coordination of funding between these two principal funding streams. The USG interagency team in Mozambique recognizes the importance of strong coordination between Global Fund and USG bilateral resources to ensure optimal efficiency and effectiveness of programs and activities. To achieve this goal, USG Mozambique requires a Global Fund Coordinator with dynamic coordination and strong leadership skills. Working in close coordination with the PEPFAR Coordination Office and staff from other health programs, the Global Fund Coordinator develops and strengthens coordination and communication mechanisms between Global Fund activities and other USG efforts in Mozambique to ensure maximal effectiveness of all USG health programs.</p>
<p>One of the many ways in which USG supports Global Fund grants is through technical assistance both through broad bilateral efforts as well as central mechanisms to strengthen grant management. Recently, the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) has initiated a program that would place a Global Fund "Coordinator" in selected U.S. missions, with the objective of facilitating the coordination and synergies of Global Fund grants with U.S. Government HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs, as well as supporting and strengthening the implementation of Global Fund grants at the country level.</p>
<p>The Global Fund Coordinator, hereafter referred to as "incumbent", would assume responsibility for coordinating critical communications between and participation among various USG departments and agencies (USAID, CDC, State, DOD, etc.) in supporting various efforts related to the Global Fund portfolio in Mozambique. As this position would need to liaise closely with USG technical staff working on program implementation in support of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, this proposed position would function as part of an interagency USG team and be physically located at CDC (which is co-located in the same building as USAID).</p>
<p>Because this position involves cross-cutting activities in multiple programs and encompasses multiple agencies and departments, the incumbent would report to Senior USG leadership in health programming. With USG now having a decision making seat on the Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM), the coordination mechanism for the Global Fund activities in country, incumbent will report to the USG CCM representative (currently CDC Country Director, with USAID Health Team Lead as back-up). CDC, as the employing agency, will manage administrative requirements (personnel files, formal evaluation procedures, payroll, security clearance, etc.). <br /><br />General Principles<br />o Incumbent is the primary point of contact within the USG team to facilitate and communicate issues related the coordination between Global Fund and the USG in terms of planning and implementation of activities in the funded areas.<br />o Incumbent is expected to serve as the principal Coordinator on behalf of USG to the various principal recipients of Global Fund funding, including various relevant Ministries (Ministry of Health, Ministry of Women and Social Action), the National AIDS Council, and Civil Society. <br />o This position will need to liaise closely with USG technical staff working across agencies on program implementation in support of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria; therefore, this proposed position would function as part of an interagency USG team. <br />o The USG Mozambique team has an internal Global Fund Task Force of interested and relevant technical staff members to improve internal communication and coordination on issues related to Global Fund grants. The Coordinator will assume responsibility for coordinating and running these routine meetings as well as setting up the agenda, preparing relevant documents and hand-outs for meetings, and producing and disseminating minutes of meetings. The Coordinator will be accountable to ensure this group meets regularly and work towards achieving overall objectives. <br />o With USG now having a decision making seat on the Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM) the incumbent will report to the USG CCM representative (currently CDC Director, with USAID Health and HIV/AIDS Team Lead as back-up). Should the USG CCM representative change to no longer be the CDC Director, incumbent will continue to report to the USG CCM representative but receive formal supervision from the CDC Director.<br />o The Ambassador/Chief of Mission heads the in-country foreign assistance program and is the final decision maker under PEPFAR Guidance for all program plans and activities submitted to the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator for approval. S/he sets the overall policy context within which the representative to the CCM supervises the incumbent.<br />o Incumbent is a facilitator, a communicator, and at times, a negotiator. Incumbent is, in general, not a technical director, although incumbent on occasion will be expected to participate in and/or communicate technical issues of relevance to the USG and the Global Fund. <br />o Incumbent is responsible for preparing documents and communication related to Global Fund performance and/or USG-Global Fund coordination to internal and external audiences in a timely fashion. Internal audiences shall be limited to USG participants, including USG agencies represented in Mozambique, in particular staff working in the PEPFAR Program, the President's Malaria Initiative, USAID-funded TB Country Assistance Program (TB-CAP), and other HIV- and health-related programs supported by the US Government. External audiences shall include host country government partners and stakeholders, non-governmental implementing partners, multilateral partners and, less frequently, the host country's media and general public.<br /><br />o Principal Duties:<br />o Coordinator with USG point persons (1) in-country including the HIV, TB and malaria focal points; (2) with U.S. Government point persons at headquarters, including the USG Global Fund Focal Point; and (3) the Global Fund Portfolio Manager and other donors and stakeholders. 25%</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) <strong>o Are, o are not</strong> presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) <strong>o Have, o have not</strong>, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3)<strong> o Are, o are not</strong> presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) <strong>o Have, o have not</strong>, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />Office of Health Affairs<br />National Biosurveillance Integration Center <br />245 Murray Lane<br />Washington, DC 20528</p>
<p>B. Introduction and Overview</p>
<p>Office of Health Affairs (OHA) is the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) principal authority for all medical and public health matters. Within OHA the National Bio-Surveillance Integration Center's (NBIC) duty is to aggregate and integrate information from food, agricultural, public health, environmental monitoring, and the intelligence community within federal and state agencies and private sources to provide an early warning system for an outbreak or possible bioterrorism attack. <br /><br />The Government's objective is to subscribe to a content aggregator service that provides a collated RSS (Really Simple Syndication aka Rich Site Summary) data feed of health incident report information garnered from public sources reconciled to Department of Homeland Security, Office of Health Affairs requirements.</p>
<p>(Background)<br />HSPD-9 dated 30 January 2004 and HSPD-10 dated 21 April 2004 directs DHS to establish a National Biosurveillance Integration System (NBIS) to provide early detection and situational awareness of biological events of potential national consequence by acquiring, integrating, analyzing, and disseminating existing human, animal, plant, and environmental biosurveillance system data into a common operating picture (COP) that represents a comprehensive depiction of the global biosurveillance security environment (GBSE). The NBIS, comprising of representatives from all member agencies, will integrate and analyze all-agency/source biosurveillance information to recognize unusual biological events and provide situational awareness to the NBIS community and decision-makers through the development of a biological COP (BCOP) and targeting reporting. The BCOP will augment the DHS National Operation Center's COP, which provides a consistent, integrated picture of biosurveillance situational awareness throughout the country. The NBIS will facilitate collaborative interagency analysis to ensure fully-integrated biosurveillance situational awareness and provide near-real time awareness to the Incident Management Group (IMG) and the DHS National Operations Center (NOC). Public Law 110-53 directs DHS to establish the National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC) to facilitate improved information sharing and enhanced situational awareness to facilitate national decision-making to enable timely response.</p>

<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>B. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors' initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>C. The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to: (1) Delete "Specific Focus Areas for 2011" in its entirety and replace with the following which includes dollar amounts and period of performance:
<p><br />Specific Focus Areas for 2011</p>
<p>Trusted Information Sharing Across Domains: Develop an accreditable, automatable multi-domain security policy. The goal of this effort is to demonstrate trustworthy information sharing across multiple (at least three) security domains with changing conditions (in policy, data, and requirements) driving near-real-time changes in configuration.<br /><br />Note: Examples of &lsquo;domains' (as per the CNSSI 4009 definition) include coalitions, sensitivity compartments, communities of interest, levels of classification, and others.</p>
<p>White papers for this topic will be due by: 20 November 09. Awards will not exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging from $400,000 - $500,000.</p>
<p><br />Cross Domain Identity Management: Maintaining track of who has access to what resources is a non-trivial, but mostly understood challenge within a single domain. When this capability is extended into a cross domain environment, many critical issues immediately arise and make what seems reasonably solvable in a single domain quite thorny. Examples of these issues mostly are either need-to-know issues or covert channels. Need-to-know issues include such things as - What do low-side users need to know about high-side users? Covert channels involve changes in one domain becoming detectable in other, less-privileged domains.</p>
<p>White papers for this topic will be due by: 20 November 09. Awards will not exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging from $500,000 - $1,000,000.</p>
<p>Data Aggregation, Mitigation, and Prevention: A classic concern with automated data handling is the data aggregation issue. Aggregation, in this context, refers to a combination of data generating a classification higher than the high-water-mark of its component parts. This can occur for many reasons, one generic case being the combination of specific information, the method that information was gathered by, and the specific source that was utilized by that method. There are many other examples of aggregation issues, this is just one. Finding automatable methods to assure the prevention of inappropriate release of aggregated information (either minimally in a single instance, or ideally over a configurable period of time) with and via adaptable services is a significant challenge.</p>
<p>White papers for this topic will be due by: 20 November 09. Awards will not exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging from $500,000 - $1,000,000.</p>
<p>All other information remains the same.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to: (1) Change the submission dates for the white papers in IV.3 as follows below and (2) include the technical area that you are responding to in IV.2 in Section A of the white paper.
<p>Replace IV.3. SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES in its entirety with the following</p>
<p>IV.3 SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 09 should be submitted by 01 Mar 2009; FY 10 by 01 Dec 2009; FY 11 by 01 Dec 2010; FY 12 by 01 Dec 2011 and; FY 13 by 03 Dec 2012. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 Sep 2013, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>No other changes have been made</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Request for Information (RFI):<br />Lasercom Tech Demo (LTD)</span></strong>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br /><em>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, A SOLICITATION, A REQUEST FOR QUOTES, OR AN INDICATION THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Background &amp; Description</strong><br />This Request for Information (RFI) by the USAF Space and Missile Center (SMC) seeks to determine availability of the US industrial technology and manufacturing base to fulfill a need for a Lasercom Technical Demonstration (LTD) satellite system. LTD must demonstrate: a) a laser communications (Lasercom) capability, and b) a flexible, rapidly deployable, medium weight class geosynchronous satellite bus for LTD and other potential future demonstration payloads.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">An LTD acquisition could potentially start in Government Fiscal Year 2011 (FY11), with the goal to provide on-orbit capability FY15 through FY20 that enables payload demonstration and evaluation and residual operational capability. Included are: a satellite bus with a high-rate IF/RF subsystem as a secondary payload, a Lasercom primary payload (supplied by a government laboratory or a contractor), satellite planning/control, and a high-rate deployable RF ground station. A bus dedicated to only the LTD payload or co-hosting with other commercial or military payloads may be considered, so long as all LTD objectives can be met. User terminals and their mission planning/control are not included.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">SMC solicits industry's experience, concepts, and capabilities relevant to possible LTD architectures and system design. Responses should address your experience fielding geosynchronous space vehicles and demonstration payloads in rapid, time-certain, low cost programs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Demonstrated innovation is encouraged, and consideration of all possible solutions (i.e. use of commercial, Government, and/or military systems and components) may be entertained. Developing within budget and schedule constraints will be critical to successfully fielding LTD. Responses should describe the sufficiency of your existing technology and manufacturing bases, or show how they would be qualified and proven flight ready within the demanding schedule constraint.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Respondents may address only the satellite &amp; ground elements, only payload, or all.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">No telephone inquiries will be accepted. All inquiries (technical, contractual, administrative), questions, or clarifications of any kind must be submitted via email to the (POC) listed below. Regarding this RFI, direct contact or one-on-one meetings with a contracting officer, program manager, or technical parties, is not allowed, apart from the Government Exchange Meetings described later in the RFI.<br /><br />The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Objectives</strong><br />Objectives of this RFI include the following:<br />&bull; Gather information on the industry technology and manufacturing base for LTD<br />&bull; Gather information on industry experience in: architecture, system, payload, components, and technologies relevant to LTD<br />&bull; Gather information regarding industry's experience in rapidly developing, demonstrating, designing, fabricating, integrating, testing, and operating hi-tech, demonstration payloads (particularly those relevant to LTD)<br />&bull; Gather programmatic (schedule, cost, risk) information relevant to LTD<br />&bull; Support preliminary acquisition documentation and strategy development for a potential LTD</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Topics for Responses<br /></strong>Briefly and clearly describe your experience in concepts and approaches relevant to LTD at the following levels: architecture; system, satellite, and ground; payload; and critical components (such as laser diodes). Provide experience/approaches of minimum, value-added Mission Assurance, System Engineering, and business processes that still achieve confidence in rapid delivery and flight. Include citations of specific historical and current development programs &amp; capabilities. Responses to all or part of this RFI will be accepted. The LTD assumptions and characteristics under consideration are shown in appropriate sections below.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>LTD System Characteristics:</em><br />&bull; Approximately 12 month checkout over CONUS prior to transfer to Indian Ocean satellite location<br />&bull; On-orbit design life: 1 year minimum, with 5 years goal <br />&bull; Survivability: natural environment<br />&bull; Technical Maturity: to support desired 4-year deployment schedule, the Government strongly favors technologies assessed to be at TRL 6 or greater, where technology exists that is relevant to meeting LTD objectives</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Satellite &amp; Integration<br /></span>Briefly describe aspects of your company, products and services, and past programs, relevant to LTD, including rapidly delivering a satellite, launch support, and ground operations, and associated business and technical management approaches used. The Government is particularly interested in information related to integrating optical payloads, their associated high speed data processing, and collaboration with national laboratories. Discuss flexibility of your satellite bus to host other potential demo payloads, such as: high-rate RF relay with large aperture antenna(s), tactical EHF theater communications on the move, or small strategic EHF communications with V-band crosslinks.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to inform industry of the current status of the Comprehensive Tactical Maintenance and Repair (CTIMR) procurement.   Based on feedback provided by our industry partners, the government has finalized its acquisition strategy.   While the scope of work envisioned for this procurement remains largely unchanged, industry partners who will be able to participate as prime contractors has been tailored as described below: 


	Area 1 (El Centro / San Diego) will be set-aside for certified HUBZONE small business contractors only.
	Area 2 (Yuma / Tucson) remains an unrestricted, or full and open, procurement.
	Area 3 (El Paso / Marfa) remains an unrestricted, or full and open, procurement.
	Area 4 (Del Rio / Laredo / Rio Grande) will be set-aside for certified 8(a) small business contractors only.

The timing and approach for formally issuing these procurements is:

&#61607;	Three separate Requests for Proposal (RFPs) will be issued beginning in late October 2009.  
&#61607;	One RFP will be issued for Areas 2 and 3.
&#61607;	One RFP will be issued for Area 1.
&#61607;	One RFP will be issued for Area 3.
&#61607;	The RFP for Areas 2 and 3 will be issued first, followed approximately three weeks later by the RFP for Area 1.  Subsequent the release of the RFP for Area 1, the RFP for Area 4 will be released approximately three weeks later.   

Other changes to the draft RFP include:  updates to the evaluation and award criteria; formally incorporating the revised bonding levels announced on August 6, 2009; changes to the contract type in Option Years 1 and 2; and, other miscellaneous editorial changes.  

Of note, the contract type for this procurement will remain cost type.  At this time, we ask companies that do not have Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) certified cost accounting systems AND intend to pursue one or more of these procurements as a prime contractor to contact the Contracting Officer for this effort so that we can begin working with DCAA to certify your systems.  It is important to note that companies that do not have, or cannot achieve, certification will be ineligible to participate as a prime contractor on these efforts.

Questions regarding these changes, or requests to begin DCAA certification, can be directed to Yolanda Brown at email address CTIMR@cbp.dhs.gov.  Additionally, please continue to check the CTIMR website as well as FEDBIZOPPS located at http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/ti/ctimr/ and www.fbo.gov for updates.

<DESC>On August 26 2009, the USMC and the Natick Contracting Division (NCD) posted a Sources Sought Notice for upocming acquisition W911QY-09-R-0027 to identify small businesses that may be interested in, and capable performing the specified work, and to make a small business capability determination in accordance with FAR Part 19.5.  In response to this posting, seven (7) small business responses were received.<BR><BR>Based on a review of the information provided, we have determined, and the Small Business Administration (SBA) has concurred, that this acquisition will be pursued as a 100% Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Set Aside under NAICS Code 423450.  <BR><BR>We wish to thank all of the interested parties for submitting the requested information.  <BR><BR>Based on the above, and in light of other strategy decisions that have been made regarding this acquisition, the following strategy update is provided, noting that the Government reserves the right to change the strategy if/as determined to be in the best interest of the Government:  <BR><BR>This contracting effort will be pursued as a 100% SDVOSB set aside for NAICS Code 423450.  A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract type is planned, with one (1) base year and four (4) one-year options.  The contracts will be executed using FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 15 formal source selection procedures.  The vast majority (~99%) of the effort will be for procurement of initial issue medical and dental equipment and supplies to enable the USMC to maintain its Authorized Medical Allowance Lists and Authorized Dental Allowance Lists (AMALs/ADALs).  The remaining 1% will be for the procurement of services related to the items being procured (e.g. equipment training, maintenance/repair, etc).  A minimum of two (2) and a maximum of three (3) contract awards are planned. A $3 M minimum guaranteed contract price for each awardee is planned, to be awarded to each recipient in the first Delivery Order (DO).  Subsequent DOs are planned to be competed amongst the awardees (except in emergency situations) with best value award made after consideration of proposed price, delivery schedule and past DO performance.  The maximum value of the entire acquisition (all awards and DOs) is $247 M.  The Government does not intend to allot program funding evenly among awardees, but rather to compete each DO as previously described to the awardee whose DO proposal provides best value to the Government. <BR><BR>The USMC and NCD are in the process of finalizing the contract documents for review and release.  Release of the final RFP is tentatively planned for January, 2010 with awards tentatively planned for March 2010.<BR><BR>Please contact Peter Wallace at peter.wallace@us.army.mil with any questions concerning this acquisition.<BR>

<DESC>UNCLAS: Dist A Approved for public release<BR>Market Survey Questionnaire for <BR>Bridge - Light Assault Gap Crossing Capability:  Type II<BR><BR>GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as confidential under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term confidential in the context of Classified Information, we will use the term PROPRIETARY.] Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or PROPRIETARY restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:   <BR> <BR>1.	Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) PROPRIETARY with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <BR> <BR>2.	In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as PROPRIETARY may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<BR> <BR>3.	The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data.<BR> <BR>4.	Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the PROPRIETARY legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS: and PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS.<BR>            <BR>5.	In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<BR> <BR>6.	The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondents marking of data as PROPRIETARY will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.  The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain confidential information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available. <BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:<BR><BR>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Also, it is not a request seeking contractors interested in being placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this questionnaire is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.<BR><BR>PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT:<BR><BR>The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain information on commercial industry capability to satisfy US Army requirements for a Light Assault Gap Crossing Capability (LAGCC) bridge. The requirement will be achieved in a single step versus an evolutionary series of steps. <BR><BR>1.	The Type II LAGCC system shall fully support execution of joint critical operational activities (Threshold {T}), and all critical operational activities (Objective {O}), identified in the applicable joint and system integrated architectures. The system must satisfy the technical requirements for transition to Net-Centric (T), or already Net-Centric (O), military operations to include: <BR><BR>a.	 DOD Information Technology and Profile Registry (DISR) mandated Global Information Grid (GIG) Information Technology (IT) standards and profiles identified in the TV-1; <BR><BR>b.	DISR mandated GIG Key Interface Profiles (KIPs) identified in the KIP declaration table; <BR><BR>c.	Net Centric Operations Warfare (NCOW) Resource Management (RM) Enterprise Services; <BR><BR>d.	Information assurance requirements including availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and no repudiation, issuance of an Interim Approval to Operate (IATO) (T), and Approval to Operate (ATO) (O), by the Designated Approval Authority (DAA); and,   <BR><BR>e.	Operationally effective information exchanges; and mission critical performance and information assurance attributes, data correctness, data availability, and consistent data processing specified in the applicable joint and system integrated architecture views.<BR><BR>2.	Military Load Class (MLC) for the Type II Bridge shall be MLC 40/MLC 50 caution (T) and MLC 70/MLC 85 caution (O).<BR><BR>3.	The Bridge Launching Kit (BLK) for the Type II bridge shall be a platform independent kit that can be mounted on the following vehicles:  HUMMV, BFV, M113 (T) and have a desired objective for the following vehicles:  FMTV, Stryker, HEMTT, MTVR, ASV, FCS, JLTV (O).  Providing a universal launch kit that does not require modification to the vehicle is objective (O).  <BR><BR>4.	The BLK for the Type II LAGCC shall be capable of attaching to the host vehicle within 30 minutes with a vehicle crew sized element and organic lift equipment.<BR><BR>5.	The Force Protection shall not be degraded for the host vehicle of the Type II LAGCC during any time the bridge system is on the vehicle. An unarmored vehicle carrying a high probability target is an unacceptable risk.<BR><BR>6.	The Type II LAGCC shall have no mission failure due to a single point failure from 20mm weapons fire. These bridges will be high probability targets and as such, will likely receive high volumes of fire.  Robust architecture is a must for these bridges to survive long enough to complete the mission under fire.<BR><BR>7.	The Type II LAGCC shall be able to cross gaps of at least 8m (T), 18m (O).<BR><BR>8.	Type II LAGCC shall provide a single lane of 4.0m (132) (T), 4.5m (149) (O).  All of these bridges are designed for a single lane of traffic at one time. <BR><BR>9.	The Type II LAGCC shall also be transportable by highway, ocean, rail, and air assets.  Movement to the theater shall be accomplished primarily by means of airlift utilizing a C-130 transporter aircraft. The Type II LAGCC shall also be transportable by a CH-47 in the stored or employed configuration. The CH-47 requirement is based on the Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) ability to move rapidly about the battlefield as C-130 transport can be restrictive. Once in the theater of operation, the primary mode of transportation will be on a wheeled platform, trailer mounted or mounted on top of an IBCT host vehicle.<BR><BR>10.	 The Type II LAGCC shall be compliant, at minimum, with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) STANAG 2010/2021 and The Tri-lateral Codes for Military Bridging and Gap Crossing Equipment (TDTC).<BR>11.	Type II LAGCC shall not degrade the mobility of the host vehicle by more than 25% (T), 10% (O). Bridge systems must be able to keep pace with the maneuver element to maintain momentum.<BR><BR>12.	The Type II LAGCC shall be capable of operating in all types of weather (rain, snow, salt spray, fog, ice, dust, sand, turbulence and high humidity), hot and basic climatic zones (-25F to 125F), and wind speeds up to 50 knots without special kits while maintaining full mission capability (T).  Shall have cold weather kits allowing operation down to -50F (O).<BR><BR>13.	The Type II LAGCC shall be capable of fording at a normal depth of 48 inches without an affixed deep water fording kit.  All external optics and electronic components shall be watertight / proof to preclude damage during shallow water fording operations (T).<BR><BR>14.	Type II LAGCC Launch/Retrieve Requirements: <BR><BR>Threshold (T):<BR>The operators of the host vehicle (not to exceed a crew of 2 soldiers), shall launch/retrieve the bridge in 10 minutes or less during daylight hours, 15 minutes or less during  all conditions of visibility  and 15 minutes while wearing Individual Protective Equipment (IPE). The LAGCC must be launchable/retrievable from both ends of the bridge.<BR> <BR>Objective (O):<BR>The operators of the host vehicle (not to exceed a crew of 2 soldiers) shall launch/retrieve the bridge in 5 minutes or less during daylight hours, 10 minutes or less during all conditions of visibility and 10 minutes while wearing IPE.<BR><BR>15.	The Type II LAGCC shall have a means of determining remaining service life and safety/structural deficiencies, which does not require an external power source. The conditions and use of the bridge can vary greatly and it is essential to have a method for determining safety and service life of the bridge.<BR><BR>16.	The Type II LAGCC shall have an average transport reconfiguration time of 2 hours or less, using equipment operators and onboard tools (T), or loaded and removed in operable configuration and immediately available for towing/operation by its designated prime mover (O) after C-130 transport. <BR><BR>17.	The Type II LAGCC shall be integrated onto one trailer (T) or one truck (O). This trailer or truck can be existing or newly developed specifically for use with the LAGCC Type II bridge. The reduction of logistical requirements while improving tactical capabilities is an overarching objective of any and all new equipment.<BR><BR>18.	The Type II LAGCC launch/retrieval mechanisms shall have a power source that utilizes standard military fuels (JP8) and standard lubricants (if required), or be capable of utilizing the power source (i.e. electrical, air, hydraulic) of the host vehicle (T), and slave receptacle of any military vehicle for power (O). <BR><BR>19.	The Type II LAGCC launcher/retriever shall provide a back-up capability to simply be launched and retrieved (T), within 30 minutes (O). The Type II LAGCC will be the sole tactical gap crossing capability within the IBCT.  <BR><BR>20.	The power source for the Type II LAGCC must possess a NATO slave receptacle. The NATO slave receptacle is standard auxiliary equipment on military equipment and allows interoperability with any vehicle for emergency starts.<BR><BR>21.	The Type II LAGCC, when mounted onto or towed by the host vehicle, shall be capable of sustained hard surface speeds of 40 mph (T), 50 mph (O).  One of the core capabilities of the proposed IBCT vehicle platform is to move rapidly about the battlefield maintaining a vehicle speed of 40 mph on hard surface roads.  The Type II LAGCC must be capable of rapid deployment to critical areas immediately upon notification, and have the ability to rapidly relocate in support of and maintain pace with the IBCT.<BR><BR>22.	The Type II LAGCC shall have a roadway width which provides adequate traction when wet or dry for all vehicles organic to the IBCT, (refer to MLC threshold and objective as previously stated), traveling at a normal crossing speed of up to a maximum 15 miles per hour (T), 25 MPH (O).<BR><BR>23.	The Type II LAGCC shall be equipped with lifting and tie down provisions for transportation in accordance with (IAW) Military Standard (MIL-STD) 209. Military standard lifting and tie down provisions are necessary for safe and efficient deployment in all modes of transportation.<BR><BR>24.	The Type II bridge structural components shall withstand 17,600 MLC 30 vehicle crossings (T), 20,000 MLC 50 crossings (O), without experiencing a durability failure.  The launch/retrieve mechanism and bridge structural components shall withstand 800 launches and retrieve cycles (T), 1,000 launches and retrieve cycles (O), without experiencing a durability failure. The Type II LAGCC durability requirements are based upon a 10-year life, which was comprised of 8 years of peacetime and two 180 day wartime periods.  It is estimated that a small number of caution crossings will be conducted during the 180-day wartime periods amounting to approximately 150 vehicle crossings at the allowable cautionary MLC.<BR><BR>25.	The Type II LAGCC shall have a manual bridge travel lock to lock the bridge into the stowed position while traveling (T).  The Type II LAGCC shall have an automated bridge travel lock to lock the bridge into the stowed position while traveling and must alert the operator and commander that the bridge travel lock is in position (O). This requirement is necessary in order to ensure safe operation of the vehicle in travel mode and to prevent damage to the bridge or system. The automated bridge travel lock would ensure the operators are not exposed to enemy fire while emplacing or recovering the bridge.<BR><BR>26.	The Type II LAGCC shall be able to perform its mission while in an electromagnetic environment consistent with requirements set for ground based systems and other vehicle in the Joint Force. This includes voice, data, and camera video.<BR><BR>27.	Radio frequency dependent components of the Type II LAGCC must not produce electromagnetic emissions that interfere with or degrade the performance of existing platforms, dismounted personnel, instrumentation, weapons, sensors, or communications subsystems operating within its range.  Radio frequency dependent components of the proposed system must comply with applicable national and international spectrum management statutes, policies and regulations, to include obtaining spectrum supportability in all host nations where deployment of the system or equipment is planned.  This includes joint spectrum certification, and host nation coordination.<BR><BR><BR><BR>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE:<BR><BR>1.	Number each response with the appropriate question number. <BR><BR>2.	You do not have to repeat the question in your response. <BR><BR>3.	If you cannot answer the question, please indicate No Response.<BR><BR>4.	If a response will satisfy another question, state: See response to question XX. <BR><BR>5.

<AWARDEE>Olmsted Medical Center, 210 Ninth Street SE
, Rochester, MN 55904-6425 US
<DESC>AWARD NOTICE<br />Award was made to Olmsted Medical Center to conduct a two year study designed to first collect data and then trend herpes zoster incidence to monitor the impact of the zoster vaccine program.
<p>Justification for other than full and open competition was considered due to the fact that Olmsted Medical Center currently posses intellectual property rights to historical records of herpes zoster incidence spanning half a century, which offers unique advantages as a site for conducting population-based research of herpes zoster. More than 92% of its Olmsted County, Minnesota residents have provided authorization to use their individual patient records in medical research. Medical information for ~125,000 residents can therefore be followed across all hospitals, emergency departments, offices and outpatient surgery centers within Olmsted County, with visit-specific diagnostic and procedural information warehoused within an electronic database and linked back to their primary care facility. This forum was established many decades ago by Olmsted Medical Center, and represents a unique and proprietary dataset in which to study herpes zoster trends since 1945. Market research revealed that no other dataset of this kind is currently available.</p>
<p>This unique dataset has been used by Olmsted Medical Center employees as the valid basis for over 100 different research papers on a wide variety of primary care illnesses, delivery of health care, and herpes zoster. Recently Olmsted Medical Center published the most comprehensive&nbsp;study of the epidemiology of herpes zoster ever conducted in the US, covering the years 1996 through 2001 (Mayo Clinic Proc. 2007;82:1341-9). This ongoing research and expertise within the Olmsted Medical Center further supports the CDC's decision to contract with this business concern.<br />See the attached Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) for further details regarding this sole sourced acquisition.</p>

<AWARDEE>RICHFORD HEALTH CENTER INC;53 MAIN ST;RICHFORD;VT;054769903
<DESC>to FAR 6-303 and 6-304, and under the below stated circumstancesand the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source in thegeographic area of the needed services and no other services willsatisfy VA requirements), this Justification and Approval for other thanfull and open competition is approved for the following reasons:
1.	  The agency and contracting activity are the Department ofVeterans Affairs and VA Medical Center, 21 North Main Street, WhiteRiver Junction, VT 05009.
2.	The action to be justified is the award of a contract underother than full and open competition to Richford Health Center Inc.(Contractor), for the period August 31, 2009 through June 30, 2010 withtwo one-year options to renew.  Contractor is a not-for profit, Federaltax exempt, small business concern organized under the laws of Vermont,and is a nonprofit organization.
  3.  The services required will allow the VA's Mental Health Service toutilize the services of Contractor to provide mental health careservices, via telemedicine processes, to eligible veterans and NationalGuard members (patients) in and around Richford, VT, in a remote area offar northern Vermont.  The estimated value of these services for thebase year of the contract is $11,075 and for all three years (includingtwo option years) of the contract $33,225.
4.	  The statutory authority is 10 USC 253(c)(1).
5.	  Based on communications with Contractor and the VA's MentalHealth Service, and review of relevant documentation and facts,Contractor and Contractor's Vermont licensed social workers are uniquelyqualified by virtue of education, training, experience, facilities andgeographic location to provide the requested services, because:  (i)Contractor is located in far northern Vermont where VA's patients arealso located and where services must be provided, and so that VApatients do not have to travel long distances for treatment; (ii)Contractor has a modern, permanent medical treatment facility which isuniquely suited in this geographical area to provide flexible schedulingfor telemental health care treatment services for VA's patients; (iii)Contractor has the necessary medical providers, and treatment andequipment storage facilities, to provide and support those services;(iv) Contractor is able to provide experienced Vermont licensed socialworkers with the required masters degrees to treat VA patients andconsult with VA physicians regarding that treatment; (v) Contractormaintains a properly equipped and secured facility to provide full timesecurity consistent with applicable VA regulations for VA-owned andsupplied information technology and telecommunications equipment andsystems; (vi) Contractor has necessary information technology and otheradministrative support personnel who are available to the VA if and asneeded; (vii) Contractor has appropriate treatment facilities that meetthe requirements of privacy and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability andAccountability Act) for VA's patients and patient information; and(viii) the location of Contractor near the affected VA patientpopulation saves costs for patients and the Government.  In addition,the grant which funds this service specifies that the contractorperforming the service be a FQHC (federally qualified health center),and Richford Health Center is such a facility. 
6.	Notice was published in Federal Business Opportunity Systems onJune 1, 2009, but no timely or responsive inquires from potentialcontractors were received as a result of this publication.  Becauseservices must be performed in far northern Vermont, the proposedContractor is experienced and uniquely qualified to perform theseservices, and the costs of this proposed contract is below market rates,it does not appear that other providers will be able to perform theservices required.
7.	The anticipated cost to the Government is fair and reasonable,by virtue of the fact that the amounts payable under the proposedcontract recover only the Contractor's licensed social worker time (twohalf days per week plus periodic consultation time with VA mental healthcare providers) of $11,075 per year (and no charge for other support andadministrative personnel nor for VA-utilized space at Contractor'sfacility), except for an additional information technology supportpersonnel cost of $27.91 per hour when and if needed.
8.	Market research shows that the current salary and benefits forexperienced clinical social workers with masters degrees such as theVA's own full time licensed social workers with masters degrees in thisfacility's area in White River Junction, VT, for 0.2 FTE (full timeequivalent) to be approximately $20,000 per year, while Contractor'ssocial workers cost to the VA under the proposed contract is $11,075 peryear and Contractor is providing additional administrative services anduse of Contractor's space at no additional cost to the VA.   
9.	The following additional facts support use of other than fulland open competition:  None. 
10.	The following additional sources expressed an interest inwriting in the acquisition:  No responsive or timely information wasreceived.
11.	Other actions that may be taken to overcome any barriers tocompetition in the future:  None presently anticipated.

<AWARDEE>DYNAMIC CLINICAL SYSTEMS, INC.;5 WYETH RD;HANOVER;NH;037552301
<DESC>Pursuant to FAR 6-303 and 6-304, and under the below stated circumstances and the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source in the geographic area of the needed services and no other services will satisfy VA requirements), this Justification and Approval for other than full and open competition is approved for the following reasons:1.	  The agency and contracting activity are the Department of Veterans Affairs and VA Medical Center, 21 North Main Street, White River Junction, VT 05009.2.	The action to be justified is the award of a contract under other than full and open competition to XXXXXXXX (Contractor), for the period September 27, 2009 through September 26, 2010, with four one-year options to renew.  Contractor is a small business concern.3.	   The services required will allow the VA's Mental Health and Behavioral Science Service to utilize the service of Contractor to provide to this facility's Primary Mental Health Care (PMHC) Clinic, its proprietary ZZZZZZ System ("ZZS"), which is an electronic clinical information management system and services to collect, manage, analyze, and report selected PMHC clinical patient information.  This is a follow-on contract for these services and the ZZS, as Contractor and the VA had a contract for the period September 27, 2004, through September 29, 2009, for these identical services, as more fully described below.                                 Specifically, the Contractor and its ZZS:	 a.   Provide for the collection, analysis, reporting, tracking, and sharing of patient self-reported health status data;	b.   Provide for patient self-reported data entry via wireless, Web-based touchpad devices with simple, large, one question per page format that will include scroll-over help and answer validation, ability to backup and change an answer, with multiple question type formats such as "radio buttons", checklists, numeric entry and calendar date selection;	c.    Provide for a flexible patient survey group setup that may include validated general health surveys, validated specialty-specific surveys, and custom questions, such as a satisfaction survey;	d.    Provide for conditional patient surveys that are built for individual patients based on patient-based parameters or branching logic;	e.     Provide for the ability to schedule follow-up surveys without the patient needing to have a specific appointment;f.	Provide immediately-available summaries of longitudinal patient data, including graphical format;g.	Provide automatic, pre-set follow-up reminders to clinicians;h.	Provide for the ability to designate and identify discrete and multiple episodes of care;i.	Provide data management and analysis including aggregate level, de-identified patient outcomes according to various parameters;j.	Support clinical administration system access from clinician, clinical administrator, or system administrator role;k.	Provide proven technology architecture;l.	Provide integration with the VA clinical record and selected systems that is compliant with all VA and HIPAA requirements; m.	Provide hands-on clinical process design and training to identified PMHC clinicians;n.	Provide in-person, telephonic, Email and Web-based support services in a timely manner.The ZZS is able to accommodate 25 clinical users at one location and provide data for an unlimited number of patients.  The database will be continuously available to VA for VA's analysis and reporting needs.  Installation and launch of the ISS will include the following surveys:  patient surveys PHQ-9 (depression); GAD-7 (anxiety); PCL-M / PCL-C (PTSD); and SF-12v2 (general health).  Also included in the System are administrative requirements, consisting of user setup, system settings, survey tracking and training in System use and operation and standard comparative aggregate reports.  During the term of the contract, Contractor will provide regular upgrades and enhancements, and e-mail and web-based customer support, without additional charge. The estimated value of these services for the base year of the contract is $12,000 and for all five years (including four option years) of the contract $60,000.4.	  The statutory authority is 10 USC 253(c)(1).5.	  Based on communications with Contractor and the VA's Mental Health and Behavioral Science Service, and review of relevant documentation and facts, Contractor is uniquely qualified by virtue of experience, personnel, geographic location, and the successful provision of the requested services over the last five years under a previous contract with this facility to provide the requested services, because:  Contractor has developed a proprietary software package that is in place in multiple healthcare institutions nationally which meets each of the requirements set forth above in paragraph 3.  It has been the only one used in the VA system and has been developed expressly for that purpose.  There is a steep learning curve in order to implement such a system within VA because of the VA's many IT security requirements; the ability to integrate the system into VA's clinical record; and the necessity of meeting the specifications of paragraph 3, above.  The Contractor's ZZS system has been utilized by this facility and has proven its ability reliably over a five-year period to meet this facility's clinical, operational, and IT security needs - at what has been shown to be a below-market price.  It would simply not be possible for another vendor to meet these needs without the VA incurring a disruption of this Medical Center's clinical services as it struggled with the inevitable groundwork that would be required to put a different system in place.  And, indeed, this Medical Center has been told by multiple VAMCs nationally, that they have never seen such a system in any place except here.  In addition, DCS is located locally and can provide on-site personal training and support on literally a moment's notice, as it has over the last five years.  This Contractor's system offers several features that are not currently available in any other commercial or VA product; specifically:a.	 Graphic representation of current data.b.	Single question at a time administration for clarity and ease of patient entry.c.	Immediate graphic representation of all past data for easy tracking.d.	Flexibility to incorporate any assessment instrument on short notice.e.	"Smart" technology that automates the testing to administer only those tests that were abnormal on previous administrations, avoiding unnecessary repetition and shortening the burden on the patient.	            The Contractor's system was developed over a six year period at a cost of several million dollars.6.	Notice was published in Federal Business Opportunity Systems on July 13, 2009; responses were received from five parties.  However, none of them offered a specific, currently available product or service but indicated that they would be interested in working with the VA to develop a product and/or service that satisfied the requirements set forth in paragraph 3, above; therefore, using their services would require significant development time and substantial additional costs, unlike using the services of the present Contractor as described in paragraph 5 above.  In addition, none of these parties indicated they had any experience with mental health providers; all were physically located at geographically distant sites and thus not able to readily and inexpensively visit this facility to provide services; and none satisfied the abilities demonstrated by the Contractor as set forth in paragraph 4, above.                                                 7.	The anticipated cost to the Government is fair and reasonable, by virtue of the fact that the amounts payable under the proposed contract are for the same amounts as were paid in the original contract which expired on September 27, 2009.  In addition, any other contract would require the added time and expense to develop a system which could be used by the VA, rather than continuing with the current system (see paragraph 5).      8.	Market research shows that no other system is currently available which would satisfy the VA's needs set forth in paragraph 4 (see paragraphs 3 and 5.9.	The following additional facts support use of other than full and open competition:  None. 10.	The following additional sources expressed an interest in writing in the acquisition:  No additional responsive or timely information was received beyond that described above in paragraph 6.11.	Other actions that may be taken to overcome any barriers to competition in the future:  None presently anticipated.

<p><br />1. Identification of the agency and contracting activity. <br />a. Federal agency and contracting activity. HHS. NIH<br />b. Sponsoring organization. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.<br />c. Project Officer information. <br />&bull; Project Officer name. Margaret Sutherland, Ph.D.<br />&bull; Mailing address. Neuroscience Center, 6001 Executive Blvd., Room 2203, MSC 9525, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-9525<br />&bull; E-mail address. sutherlandm@ninds.nih.gov<br />&bull; Telephone number. 301-496-5680<br />2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved. <br />a. Acquisition purpose and objectives. The specific objective of this contract is for the continued maintenance of the National Research Roster of patients and families affected by Huntington's Disease. The Contractor collects data on persons with Huntington's Disease, persons at risk of the disease, and people who are related to those with or at risk of the disease. The Roster is used to contact potential participants for research studies, to locate individuals of particular research interest, and to provide statistical and demographic data on Huntington's Disease.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract extension is to systematically closeout and transfer ownership of the voluntary roster of patients and families affected by Huntington's Disease (HD Roster) to Indiana University. The HD Roster has been used to contact potential participants for research studies, to locate individuals of particular research interest, to notify individuals of current clinical trials, and to provide statistical and demographic data on Huntington's Disease. During this contract extension, ownership of HD Roster data will be transferred to Indiana University, for data where informed consent for this transfer has been obtained. For Roster participants who do not consent to have their data transferred to the Indiana University, data for these participants will be destroyed. Indiana University will also, during the consent process, determine through informed consent, which roster participants are willing to have contact information shared with the Huntington Disease Society of America's (HDSA) sponsored database, HDTrials.org, and/or similar organizational databases directed at identifying participants for HD clinical research studies. Indiana University will assume full responsibility for the confidentiality and security of all records upon transfer of ownership (when the contract expires) and will hold the Government harmless for any and all liability issues post-transfer. The HD Roster will also communicate closeout plans with HD Research investigators to allow submission of data requests and data transfer for approved data requests prior to the expiration of the contract. Strict confidentiality of records shall be maintained. The Contractor shall comply with the Privacy Act provisions of the contract.</p>
<p>b. Project background. This project is a continuation of an ongoing contract. The contract number is N01-NS-3-2357; (i) Contractor: Indiana University; (ii) Period of Performance - September 30, 2003 - September 29, 2009; (iii) Total dollar amount obligated to date: $1,802,690; (iv) The initial award was competed in 1979. Since that time, all subsequent awards were sole source. The basis for the approved JOFOCs was FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).<br />3. Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value). <br />a. Project title. National Research Roster for Huntington's Disease Patients and Families<br />b. Project description. The Contractor shall maintain and execute closeout procedures for the Roster of patients and families affected by Huntington's Disease (HD Roster). The Contractor shall maintain and update data on persons with Huntington's Disease, persons at risk of the Disease, and people related to those with or at risk of Huntington's Disease. The data collected consists of: a). Pedigree information, including a complete family history and demographic data; b). Educational background; c. Socioeconomic level; d). Occupational history; e), Clinical history of patient including particularly specification of symptom onset and symptom description (chorea, rigidity, etc.); f) Psychiatric history of patient and family members with special attention to any emotional or behavioral problems or changes. Special attention should be given to recording suicides attempted and completed. In closeout procedures the Contractor shall obtain informed consent from HD Roster participants to transfer ownership of consented data to Indiana University. In addition, the Contractor shall obtain informed consent to allow sharing of specific Roster data with other organizations involved in recruitment for clinical studies, such as the HDSA sponsored database, HDTrials.org. In implementing this transfer the Contractor will explain exactly to HD Roster participants how information on a patient or family member will be used by Indiana University and the voluntary nature of the transition of ownership to Indiana University's database. The Contractor shall ensure that HD Roster participants understand that they may elect to transfer all, some or none of the information the HD Roster has collected, to HDTrials.org or any other organizational database. The Contractor shall publicize the closeout plans for the HD Roster: 1) to HD researchers, to ensure continuity of data access during the closeout period; and 2) to HD Roster participants, to inform participants of opportunities for participation in HDTrials.org. In completion of the closeout phase of this contract, the Contractor shall supply a summary of HD Roster activities, including studies undertaken, and papers published to HD Roster participants.</p>

Nature of the acquisition and proposed unique qualifications of the contractor(s). A noncompetitive procurement is requested because of the impracticability of another contractor being able to provide the experience, efforts, and expertise of the current Contractor; necessary for performance of the closeout phase of this contract at the current operational level, without significant time delays and substantial duplication of costs which are not expected to be recovered through competition. Additionally, the highly sensitive nature of the information contained in the Huntington's Disease Research Roster requires special handling procedures. The records of those in the Roster are highly confidential due to the fact that participating individuals are either at risk for, or affected by, a fatal hereditary disease. In addition, the unique relationship which exists between the patients, families, and Indiana University cannot be duplicated with other organizations.</p>
<p>The Statement of Work for the current Indiana University contract has required the Contractor to submit requests for identifiable information to the Roster participant in writing, and to receive written permission from the Roster participant for release of information. The Informed Consent Form under the current contract contains a "Privacy Act Notification Statement", which informs the Roster participant or potential Roster participant, that access to the information given for the HD Research Roster is restricted to staff members of the NIH, and Indiana University, who are responsible for maintaining the Roster. However, on certain occasions, information "may" be disclosed outside the NIH and/or Indiana University to: 1) a Congressional Office upon the Roster participant's request; and 2) the Department of Justice under certain conditions. Otherwise, the medical information given for the HD Research Roster will not be disclosed to anyone without the Roster participant's written permission, or that of the Roster participant's legally authorized representative.</p>
<p>The current Contractor, Indiana University, would have to contact over 4,300 individuals on the Roster to obtain their written consent to have their record(s) from the Roster transferred to a new Contractor. Since this extension is intended to allow a closeout phase for this contract, it is impractical to transfer data to another contractor prior to closeout, since this would more than double the cost of the closeout and substantially delay the closeout procedures.</p>
<p>6. Description of the efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable. Indicate whether a FedBizOpps notice was or will be publicized as required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under FAR 5.202 applies. <br />A notice of our intent to extend the current contract (N01-NS-3-2357) for a two year period with Indiana University was published on FedBizOpps on July 1, 2009 for 45 days and was amended on August 27, 2009. Another 15 day period for response to this notice elapsed on September 11, 2009. We received no response to the announcement.<br />7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost/price to the Government will be fair and reasonable. The Contracting Officer will perform a cost analysis on all elements of cost for the two year extension. A Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data will be requested at the conclusion of negotiations. An award will be made only if during discussions it is shown that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. <br />8. Description of the market research conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the results, or a statement of the reasons market research was not conducted.</p>
<p>The NINDS held several teleconferences with Huntington's Disease organizations and clinical investigators. Based on input from these groups, it was clear to everyone that the data held within the Roster is unique and would be difficult to replicate by other sources (Privacy Act issues) without duplication of effort and significant cost to the Government. In addition, a FedBizOpps notice was posted on July 1, 2009 and amended on August 27, 2009. No sources have expressed an interest, in writing, in the proposed acquisition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>The use of other than full and open competition is requested because of the impracticability of another Contractor being able to provide the experience, efforts and expertise of the current Contractor necessary for the performance of the closeout phase of this contract without significant time delays and substantial duplication of costs. In addition, the highly sensitive nature of the information contained in the Roster requires special handling procedures. The records of those individuals listed in the Roster are highly confidential due to the fact that participating individuals are either at risk for, or affected by, a fatal hereditary disease.</p>
<p>In addition, the total costs, which would be duplicated by award to a source other than the current Contractor, would be comparable to starting the Roster from its inception. This would include activities such as identifying HD patients and families, developing family history questionnaires, obtaining institutional IRB approval and establishing a presence with the HD research and clinical community. Such a scope of activities would be in access of $1,408,307 based on funds expended during the early developmental stages of the Roster, which spanned the timeframe when the gene for Huntington's Disease was cloned. The loss of time and access to information during this critical period of HD therapeutic development is estimated to be five years. This is a minimum estimate, and the total duplicative expense and the period of delay would likely be much larger. In addition, the personal relationships which have developed between patients and families with Indiana University due to the sensitivity of records cannot be duplicated.</p>
<p>10. Listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>No other sources have expressed an interest, in writing, in the proposed acquisition.</p>
<p>11. Statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the required supplies or services. The extension will facilitate the closeout of the National Research Roster of Huntington's Disease Patients and Families (HD Roster) and transfer ownership of the voluntary roster of patients and families affected by Huntington's Disease (HD Roster) to Indiana University. No future acquisition is anticipated. In the event a future requirement of this nature becomes necessary, market research will be conducted.<br />12. Program office certification. <br />This is to certify that the portions of this justification that have been developed by the undersigned program office personnel, including supporting information and/or data verifying the Government's minimum needs, schedule requirements and other rationale for other than full and open competition, are accurate and complete. <br />Official Name &amp; Title Signature Date<br />Project Officer Margaret Sutherland, Ph.D. <br />Project Officer's Immediate Supervisor Emmeline Edwards, Ph.D. <br />Head of the Sponsoring Program Office Story Landis, Ph.D.</p>
<p>13. Contracting Officer certification. <br />This is to certify that the justification for the proposed acquisition has been reviewed and that to the best of my knowledge and belief the information and/or data provided to support the rationale and recommendation for approval is accurate and complete. <br />Official Name &amp; Title Signature Date<br />Contract Specialist Helene Braun</p>
<p>14. Chief of the Contracting Office and Head of the Contracting Activity signature(s). <br />Official Name &amp; Title Signature Date<br />Chief of the Contracting Office Kirkland L. Davis <br />Director, Office of Acquisitions, NIDA James L. Quinn <br />Head of Contracting Activity Diane F. Fraiser</p>
<p><br />15. Competition Advocate signature. <br />Official Name &amp; Title Signature Date<br />Competition Advocate Walter Schaffer, Ph.D.</p>
<p>16. HHS Senior Procurement Executive signature. <br />Official Name &amp; Title Signature Date<br />HHS Senior Procurement Executive N/A</p>

<DESC>Department of	MemorandumVeterans AffairsDate: August 31, 2009From: Anna Weishaar, V1SN 15 Contracting Office, Leavenworth. KS (10N15-90)Subj: Justification and Approval for Other than Full and Open Competition for Veteran-Owned Small Business Sole-Source Procurement JAW P.L. 109-461 and VA Information Letter 049-07-08To: Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management ( 10N)I. IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:This action is based on a requirement for a Surgical Integration System for the Columbia Missouri VA Medical Center, and is being procured in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). We are seeking approval to procure the system from Alliant Enterprises, EEC, DBA Alliant Healthcare, which is a Veteran Owned Small Business. In accordance with P.L. 109-461, 38 U.S.C. 8127 and VA Information Letter 049-07-08, Contracting Officers within the Department of Veterans Affairs are authorized to negotiate sole-source contracts with Veteran Owned Small Businesses with the approval of the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA).2.	DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED:The contract is.for the purchase of a Surgical Integration System. The total contract value is $2,629,227.533.	IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY:The requirement will he procured with an exception to Fair and Open Competition under FAR 6.302-5, based upon the authority of PL 109-461, 38 USC 8127(c).4. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF AUTHORITY CITED:Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(c), contracting officers may use other than competitive procedures, including sole-source awards, for contracts awarded to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) and Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) where the anticipated price will not exceed $5,000,000 (including options). We considered limiting competition to VOSB but. Alliant Healthcare was the only VOSB we found that could meet the Government's requirements. Therefore, we have elected to use authority of PL 109-461. 38 USC 8127(c), to conduct the procurement on a sole-source basis. 5. DESCRIPTON OF EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE  SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICALBE.The procurement was for a Surgical Integration System consisting of numerous items and components which are made by Stryker Corp and sold by Alliant Healthcare Products, a VOSB company. The communication, endoscopy booms, surgical lights and tower integration is an all encompassing OR system that enables the surgical suite to communicate with other OR rooms pathology; ICU and other areas throughout the facility. Keeping with the priorities of FAR Part8, a check was done on GSA Advantage in an attempt to determine if this product, or like products, were available on Federal Supply Schedule (FSS). Although there were companies that have some components on FSS, Stryker is the only company offering a completely integrated system. Alliant does have an FSS schedule, but these items are not currently available on their FSS contract. Stryker and Alliant's past performance was checked and they were rated superior.6. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE: The procurement was reviewed against other contractors' products to determine price fair and reasonableness. Other comparable lights, monitors, booms, and arms were found and prices were determined to be comparable with the products being purchased. In a lot of instances. Stryker Equipment was priced lower than other FSS contract holders.7.	MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED:  Extensive market research was conducted per FAR Part 10,8.	ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL  AND OPEN COMPETITION: The requirement will be procured with an exception to Fair and Open Competition under FAR 6.302-5. based upon the authority of PL 109-461, 38 USC 8127(c).9, A LISTING OF THE SOURCES. IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED, IN WRITING. AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION:NA10. STATEMENT OF ACTIONS, IF ANY. THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION  FOR THE SUPPLIES REOUIRED: Alliant does have an FSS contract and plans to add these items to their contract in the future. I l CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION: "I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this Justification and Approval are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief"Anna Weishaar Contracting OfficerAPPROVED/DISAPPROVED:tiPamela J.
