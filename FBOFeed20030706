<SUBJECT>L -- Filmwriting
<DESC>Purpose:  
The Geospatial Service and Technology Center (GSTC) located in Salt Lake City provides a variety of products and services including technical applications and a variety of geographic or mapping products for the USDA Forest Service.  These mapping products include traditional lithographic as well as more progressive “on-demand” technologies and other digital or electronic enabled geographic data.  

GSTC is planning a transition from the use of in-plant filmwriting and imagesetting devices to the use of, industry-provided pre-press technologies and products.  These services must utilize digital imaging processes that eliminate the reliance on the use of photographic film materials.  This transition shall include a variety of available computer-to-plate/press technologies.  The objective of the transition is to increase efficiencies and improve production capacity for cartographic publishing. The transition would include the ability to publish, plot, print or view a map product, produced electronically using digital technology.  The completed products may include: a) lithographic printing and b) on-demand-printing.  With escalating photographic film costs and other associated materials, and the loss of in-plant filmwriting and imagesetting capabilities; GSTC is seeking a cost effective process for delivery of cartographic published products.  

Background:  
GSTC is nearing the completion of a significant re-engineering effort of a map production system.  This new system has been designed to produce as output standard data formats.  Any resulting contract must operate utilizing the outputs requirements of the new system and provide efficient workflows with existing proprietary file formats.   

The digital imaging output environment shall be built upon commercial software and hardware.  The implementation of this process shall produce a wide variety of standard, custom, or publication quality products. 

We anticipate a significant cost benefit from robust output processes and digital imaging technologies such as computer-to-plate or other digital process capability to produce cartographic rich map products.

Scope:  
GSTC will be contracting for:

l)Lithographic printing plates using computer-to-plate (CTP) technology or equivalent technology.  
2)Output of proofs from digital files.  
3)Photographic film products - Ability to produce negative film products that adhere to lithographic printing specifications upon request.
4)Produce digital graphic files that support on-demand-printing.  These will include – PostScript, eps, pdf, TIFF.
5)On-demand printing hardcopy products from above formats.
 

Desired Results:  
The desired result from the resulting contract will be to implement a cost effective pre-press work flow.  These processes must be implemented within an eight-month timeframe, beginning with contract award.

Future development or use of evolving technologies will be utilized when cost beneficial for the Government within this proposal.

The services will be performed to publishing standards meeting cartographic output requirements.  These standards are contained in the United States Geological Survey (USGS)/Forest Service Part 5 Publication Symbols and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service Handbook 7109.24.

The contractor shall produce output products in a high volume environment.

GSTC is seeking industry comment on commercial services currently available to assist in this transition and the actual performance of the services.  GSTC is also seeking comments regarding what additional information we must provide in a formal Request for Proposal in seeking cost effective proposals from the industry.
