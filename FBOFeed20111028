<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation's Lower Colorado Region (Reclamation) has a requirement to convert the operating system on four Delta Scientific model DSC-501 vehicle barriers at Hoover Dam from a hydraulically operated system to an electro-mechanically operated system. These barriers are a key component of the facility security system providing protection to an American icon that is classified by the Department of Homeland Security as a "National Critical Infrastructure".  The vehicle barriers are expected to deploy at a moment's notice in order to restrict traffic on the dam in the event of a security breach or for other emergency situations.
This conversion work consists of replacing the existing hydraulic operating system within each barrier unit with an electro-mechanical operating system; making other associated changes to ensure adequate electrical power and controls for each unit; ensuring adequate and safe traffic control on a busy highway route without traffic interruption or safety risk to the general public or the Contractor's and Government workforces by performing work during off-peak hours or at night; and, accomplishing final testing to demonstrate the full functionality after each unit's conversion.
The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract with a performance period of approximately 120 days in duration and the contract will include clauses for payment upon delivery, i.e., progress payments will not apply.
This requirement will be solicited under full and open competition.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561621, Security Systems Services (except Locksmiths), and the related small business size standard is $12.5 Million. This NAICS code will be used to determine the small business size standard for this solicitation.  The solicitation is in the form of a Request for Proposal (RFP), which will be issued on or about November 18, 2011, with offers due approximately thirty (30) days after.  No documents will be available until the solicitation is issued.  The solicitation will only be issued electronically via www.FedBizOpps.gov.  
The Government reserves the right to issue the solicitation on paper or CD if the FedBizOpps (FBO) website becomes inoperable or if the Contracting Officer determines it is in the Government's best interest to do so.  Offerors should register at the FBO website to be included on the offeror list in order to receive notifications pertaining to the solicitation and any subsequent amendments. Central Contractor Registration (CCR) as required by FAR 4.1102, will apply to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on CCR registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Questions may be submitted in writing to Brooke Mena at bmena@usbr.gov or by fax at (702)293-8499.

<DESC>This notice serves to provide details for an upcoming pre-solicitation vendors' conference, request Company Profiles, and provide advance copies of the draft Statement of Work, draft Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan, and draft Sections L and M of the forthcoming solicitation. The purpose of the Pre-solicitation Conference is to meet with all prospective vendors interested in responding to the forthcoming Request for Proposal (RFP), answer questions regarding the requirement, perform market research, and clarify requirements. <br />Promise Neighborhoods (PN) provides competitive grants to eligible nonprofit organizations, institutions of higher education, and Indian tribes to support the development or implementation of a feasible, sustainable plan that combines a continuum of effective family and community services, strong family supports, and ambitious, comprehensive education reforms - with high-quality schools at the center - to improve the educational and life outcomes for children and youth, from birth through college. The purpose of Promise Neighborhoods is to significantly improve the educational and developmental outcomes of children and youth in our most distressed communities, and to transform those communities by (1) increasing the capacity of eligible entities that are focused on achieving results for children and youth throughout an entire neighborhood; (2) building a complete continuum of cradle-to-career solutions of both educational programs and family and community supports, with great schools at the center; (3) integrating programs and breaking down agency "silos" so that solutions are implemented effectively and efficiently across agencies; (4) developing the local infrastructure of systems and resources needed to sustain and scale up proven, effective solutions across the broader region beyond the initial neighborhood; and (5) learning about the overall impact of the Promise Neighborhoods program and about the relationship between particular strategies in Promise Neighborhoods and student outcomes. Program funds support 1-year planning grants that enable grantees to conduct activities to facilitate the development of a feasible plan for providing a continuum of services and supports appropriate to the needs of children and youth within the target neighborhood, as well as implementation grants to support the implementation of a well-conceived plan.
<p>The Department of Education (ED) is seeking a contractor to provide ongoing training and technical assistance to PN implementation and planning grantees, aspiring grantees and the field. This meeting will give ED the opportunity to talk about this requirement and to ensure a clear understanding of the work and expectations. The conference will also allow ED to receive feedback on the draft SOW and identify areas that need additional details or specification. Although the Department intends to award this under the GSA Schedule 874-1 (Mission Oriented Business Integrated Services - Consulting Services), this conference shall afford both GSA Schedule holders and non-GSA Schedule holders the opportunity to meet and, potentially, form partnership strategies before award.</p>
<p>Please find the logistical information below:</p>
<p>Purpose: Promise Neighborhoods: Technical Assistance Bidder's Conference<br />Date: Tuesday, November 8, 2011<br />Time: 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM<br />Location: 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, Washington DC 20202<br />Room #: TDC Room 105<br />Webinar Link: https://educate.webex.com/educate/onstage/g.php?d=747678582&amp;t=a</p>

It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor the GSA's E-Buy website for additional information pertaining to this pre-solicitation notice.</p>

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY
SOURCES SOUGHT / CAPABILITIES REQUEST This Market Survey is issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1.  The purpose of this Market Survey is to determine whether or not adequate competition exists to meet requirements of full and open competition and to determine the feasibility of a  small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses (SEDB) that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking companies with experience in Radio Frequency (RF) Transmit/Receive Limiters (TR Limiters) and associated technologies to include corporate knowledge, technical expertise, facilities, manufacturing equipment, and product acceptance test hardware. The TR Limiters/ Receiver Protector will be installed within the existing WR-284 type waveguide configuration of the Air Route Surveillance Radar Model 9 (ASR-9) radar system. The ASR-9 System is a medium range (60 nautical mile (nmi)) airport surveillance radar that operates at S-band with a pulse width of 1.03 microseconds, a Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) of 928 to 1321 Hertz (Hz) (1200 Hz typical) and an average power from 1188 to 1462 watts (depending on PRF).
The FAA desires to test and potentially qualify a replacement ASR-9 TR Limiter/Receiver Protector, which will provide equivalent protection and extend the operational life from 40,000 hours to approximately 80,000 hours or more.  The failure rate of the current TR Limiter/ Receiver Protector is 5 years (average of 29 per year) at the 135 radar sites.  There are four (4) TR Limiters/Receiver Protectors in each system with 1 spare on site.  It is anticipated that the replacement TR Limiter/ Receiver Protector will be dropped-in/installed within the existing WR-284 waveguide configuration of the ASR-9 radar system, and be evaluated in an operational state from same position. It is the FAA's intent, via the installation of this replacement TR Limiter/ Receiver Protector, to provide measurable improvements in reliability and maintainability. All upgrade possibilities are encouraged and welcome, from refurbishment (by replacement of individual components) up to and including the replacement of the entire legacy TR Limiter/Receiver Protector. The installation and operation of the replacement TR Limiter/ Receiver Protector must not result in the diminution of any performance characteristic associated with the legacy TR Limiter/ Receiver Protector. The estimated quantity that may be required by the Government is 200-750 each.
This Market Survey is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a solicitation for a Screening Information Request (SIR). Accordingly, this Market Survey must not be construed as either a promise to award a contract or an obligation for the Government to provide compensation for information associated with the preparation and submittal of inquiries addressing this Market Survey If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a notice will be published on FAA Contract Opportunities. No award will be made as a result of this Market Survey.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the FAA. The FAA reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey.  Responses will not be returned.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of this survey or results of information submitted.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 334511, "Air Traffic Control Radar Systems and Equipment Manufacturing".

Interested vendors are requested to provide a capabilities summary of not more than 20 pages describing product operational characteristics and production capability.
For submissions to replace the entire legacy TR Limiter/Receiver Protector, include the following information:
1)	Name and Address of your Company; URL of Company website (if applicable), and Point of Contact with telephone number.2)	Do you have and use a Quality Assurance (QA) process?3)	Is your company ISO certified? Identify which certification4)	Does your company have experience in providing long-term depot-level support? Identify the organization, # of years and describe experience5)	Does your company market a commercially available TR Limiter/Receiver Protector?6)	Does your commercially available TR Limiter/Receiver Protector meet the requirements of "Attachment A" (Figure 1 and Figure 2 and Table 1)?7)	Indicate any radar systems for which the unit is currently supporting.8)	State the number of existing TR Limiter/Receiver Protector units in the field sold by the respondent to include the sites where the FAA may observe the unit and the contract vehicle under which they were procured, along with the contract /delivery order number(s), if applicable.9)	What is your potential monthly production/delivery rate?10)	Identify warranty policies, extended warranty programs, current prices and any quantity discounts.11)	Indicate the capability to submit a unit for testing   12)	Indicate capability to incorporate these highly valued features in their alternative solutions:a.	To increase significantly the continuous operational life of a new TR Limiter/Receiver Protector in an ASR-9 radar system beyond 10 years.b.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (1), with Harlan Bioproducts for Science Inc. for purchase of Marmoset non-human primates.  Marmosets from the Harlan UK breeding colony were used previously at USAMRIID in a study that requires further research by reproducing previous experimental results.  Due to the suspected genetic differences among marmosets it is important that the non-human primates are obtained from the Harlan UK breeding colony. Recently, marmosets from another vendor were used and the results were unanticipated and different than those previously described using marmosets from the Harlan UK colony.  Further background revealed that the marmoset colonies from the different vendors might likely have genetic differences. In order to verify this hypothesis, marmosets from the Harlan UK colony are needed. The marmosets from this colony are needed in order to advance the development of important vaccine candidates for Rift Valley fever virus.   The Harlan Bioproducts for Science's is uniquely qualified to meet the Government's need as they have maintained the colony for over twenty years with specific breeding practices that have maintained the genetic purity of their marmoset population .  USAMRIID will fail to meet a major project milestone if the non-human primates are not obtained from the Harlan UK colony.  No solicitation package will be issued.  However, responses received by October 7, 2011, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a future competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Acquisition Operations, Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), located at 260 Industrial Way West, Eatontown, NJ 07724 intends to award a new work modification on a basis of other than full and open competition for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Services (PLMS).  The TAC intends to award a sole source Firm-Fixed-Priced (FFP) contract to Cerner Corporation, 2800 Rockcreek Parkway, Kansas City, MO 64117.
The VA is currently confronted with the need to extend the current Laboratory System Reengineering Project   (LSRP) Millennium PathNet Remote Hosting (RHO) contract with Cerner Corporation which includes disaster recovery infrastructure, personnel, and training for the system technical staff and application support staff required to maintain the Cerner Millennium PathNet environment to support the current LSRP Alpha (Huntington, WV VAMC) and Beta (New Jersey Healthcare System and Phoenix, AZ VAMC) test sites.  This extension is not just limited to the initial capital cost of equipment investment and future hardware technology upgrades and refreshes, but also must address data center operations management, cost, and security, space, heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) and power requirements.  Contract VA118-10-P-0077 was awarded to support data center hosting to complete testing at the Alpha and Beta test sites.  Due to delays in Alpha site roll out, and the contract ending in December 2011, a need for an extension is necessary to complete implementation and testing of Millennium PathNet at the Beta test sites.  The VHA PLMS is dependent on LSRP to support their business processes and complete the rollout to the Beta test sites. The roll out to the two Beta test sites is planned for completion by August 2012.  
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) for this effort is 518210.
This notification shall close on Friday, November 4, 2011.  All responsible sources may submit a response which shall be considered by the agency.  Questions/responses shall be submitted via e-mail to Contract Specialist, Kelly McGirr, kelly.mcgirr@va.gov, with the subject line as the synopsis number, VA118-11-RP-0042.  The Points of Contact (POCs) for this action are Kelly McGirr, Contract Specialist, 732-578-5560 or Kevin Loesch, Contracting Officer, 732-578-5487.

<SUBJECT>polarimetric hyper-spectral imaging(HSI) capability in the long-wave infrared (LWIR)
<SOLNBR>FA8601-12-T-0034(ss)
<RESPDATE>111511
<CONTACT>Jennifer R. Begg, Phone 9375222277, Email Jennifer.Begg@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC><strong>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation)</strong>
<p>The United States Air Force, ASC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking potential sources that are capable of providing polarimetric hyper-spectral imaging(HSI) capability in the long-wave infrared (LWIR). Firms responding shall specify that their equipment meets the specifications provided below and provide detailed product information to show clear technical compliance. Additionally, sales history including recent commercial companies sold to should be included to determine commerciality.</p>
<p><strong>The specific technical requirements of this polarization hardware (PH) are as follows:<br /></strong>1. Shall be compatible with Telops, Inc. Hyper-Cam.<br />2. The PH must enable the collection of HSI data between 1-5 &micro;m in two orthogonal polarization states, hereafter denoted H for horizontal (0&deg;) and V for vertical (90&deg;).<br />3. The PH substrate must be a non-hygroscopic material.<br />4. The extinction ratio of the PH must be 300:1 or better between 1-5 &micro;m. For example, the throughput of V-polarized light must be a factor of 300 less than H-polarized light when the PH is in the H position.<br />5. The transmission efficiency of the desired polarization state must be greater than 70% between 1-5 &micro;m.<br />6. Selection of the H or V polarization state must occur with an accuracy of 0.1&deg;. For example, H = 0.0&deg;&plusmn;0.1&deg; and V = 90.0&deg;&plusmn;0.1&deg;.<br />7. The H or V polarization angle must not fluctuate more than 0.1&deg; during data acquisition.<br /><br />These research projects require calibrated polarimetric HSI data collected under challenging field (non-laboratory) conditions. To expedite field data collection and reduce probability of data acquisition mistakes, the polarizing hardware (PH) must be fully integrated into the instrument. In addition to the specifications above, the following requirements pertaining to its operation within the existing Telops Hyper-Cam instrument and associated control software must be met:<br /><br />1. The PH must have a clear aperture of at least 71 mm to enable use of the Hyper-Cam's full entrance aperture.<br />2. The PH must be placed behind the Hyper-Cam's on-board blackbody calibration sources to ensure the effects of the PH are accounted for during instrument calibration.<br />3. The PH must be removable by the end-user so that non-polarimetric HSI data can still be collected with the upgraded MWIR Hyper-Cam.<br />4. The Hyper-Cam data acquisition software must be modified so that specific polarization states (e.g., horizontal and vertical) can be selected using the graphical user interface (GUI). Additionally, the GUI must indicate which polarization state (H or V) is currently active.<br />5. The Hyper-Cam data acquisition software must be modified so that the specific polarization state (e.g., horizontal or vertical) is stored in the header file of each raw polarimetric HSI data cube.</p>
<p>All interested firms shall submit a response demonstrating their capabilities to produce the requested equipment to the Primary Point of Contact listed below. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. <br /><br />Firms responding should indicate whether they are, or are not, a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, or a woman owned business. The general definition of a small business is one that is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in the field of operation in which it is proposing on Air Force contracts and with its affiliates; and the number of employees does not exceed 500. NAICS Code to be used for this acquisition is 333314. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent acquisition. Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/Foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort.<br /><br />Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any government assessments.

<DESC>The US Army Research Development Engineering Command, Natick Soldier Research Development Engineering Center (RDECOM-NSRDEC) in Natick, MA, is conducting a market survey for technical information on methods to develop a Parachute Reserve Automatic Activation Capability (PRAAC) for use with static line parachute systems. The system must be capable of automatically activating the reserve parachute of a paratrooper that is unable to activate the reserve on their own under a partial or total malfunction of his/her main canopy. The desired characteristics for such a system (not in priority order) are as follows: (1) functions on current and future static line parachute systems including the current the T-11 and MC-6 main parachutes with the T11-R reserve parachute system. (2) operates onboard high performance fixed wing, rotary wing, and non standard aircraft at speeds from 70 to 150 KIAS, (3) uses relative proximity of the aircraft in order to determine exit and separation from the aircraft prior to executing the reserve deployment criteria of evaluating descent rates, (4) must operate from exit altitudes of 600 ft above ground level or higher (threshold) and 525 ft above ground level or higher (objective), (5) must not interfere or influence any existing equipment with the exception of the reserve canopy and container, (6) must not interfere or influence any existing equipment associated with the jump platform, including aircraft avionics communications or any other electrical or mechanical systems, (7) System Reliability .995 reliability  at 95% confidence for total malfunctions where the canopy offers no lift (threshold), and with .99 reliability at 90% confidence for partial malfunctions (goal) while providing .995 reliability at 90% confidence that the system will not inadvertently activate (e.g., onboard the aircraft, during a towed jumper event, or under a full-open main canopy), (8) system must allow for the ability to manually deploy reserve canopy without changing current procedures, (9) system will have "black box" capability to store critical data of each jump that may be accessed by the user, (10) system will have a 14 year usable life to coincide with parachute expected life. (11) cost of system from $500 (objective) to $800 (threshold). Expected fielding numbers of T11Rs are in the order of approximately 70,000.<br><br>The science and technology effort in the area of applied research and experimental development being considered is on the order of $500-$700K for FY12 and potentially equivalent for 2-3 more years. Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government.  All interested firms, regardless of size are encouraged to respond to this request for information. It should be noted that this is a market survey and not a pre-solicitation notice.  A pre-solicitation notice will be published if a formal solicitation is generated.

1.0	  BACKGROUND 
In order to better serve as a focal point for toxicology information for the professional and general public, SIS seeks various ways to add to and enhance its TOXNET system of online databases and other Web resources, particularly in the area of risk assessment.  
2.0	  PURPOSE and OBJECTIVES
SIS is interested in presenting an online comprehensive, international, tabular compilation and comparison of chemical toxicity risk values.  The values should include both cancer (oral and inhalation) and non-cancer (oral and inhalation) effects, and be derived from authoritative governmental and other sources. Among the sources known to include high quality risk values and which should be consulted for the database are the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Health Canada, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, NSF International, the Dutch National Institute for Health and the Environment (RIV), the US Environmental Protection Agency, and risk values peer reviewed by Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment.  Additionally, it is important that scientific synopses are provided to explain differences in data and that links are given to each organization for more information.  The data should be in a format that will be compatible with the TOXNET system and consistent with other TOXNET databases.  The contractor will also work with NLM to identify and solicit data from additional international organizations.   This will involve:
2.1	Delivery of solicited database on TOXNET
	The contractor will include chemical names, structures, and registry numbers.	The contractor will provide quality control measures to insure the integrity of the transferred files.	Bibliographies and other information resources will be provided for cited risk values.	The nature and level of peer review will be included.	SIS and the contractor will work together on enhancing the new databases search interface for TOXNET, design improved ways to display the data, and augment it with aggregate tables and risk assessment links.
2.2	Enhancement of the new database with data from Additional Organizations
	NLM will support the contractors data acquisition from additional international organizations and specific countries as funds allow.  The contractor and the NLM will be able to seek other funding to enhance this acquisition.	An example is risk data from the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS).
3.0	  PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
The contractor will implement specific tasks to accomplish the work outlined in section 2.0 during the period of performance.  The contractor shall implement these tasks with minimal direction, but in close collaboration with the government. 4.0	  ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></strong></p>
<p>The Prequalification of Suppliers for the USPS Packaging Products Request for Proposals (RFP) is scheduled for completion by early December 2011 and the RFP is scheduled for release before the end of December 2011. The information below provides a general description of the requirements that will be set forth in the RFP's Statements of Work (SOWs). More detailed draft SOWs will be attached to the Prequalification package and the final Statements of Work will be part of the RFP issued to pre-qualified suppliers. The Prequalification of Suppliers as well as the RFP source selection process will be conducted using the USPS eSourcing system, Emptoris eRFx module.</p>
<p>Emptoris is an eSourcing solution that automates, standardizes, and streamlines the sourcing of supplies, services, equipment, transportation, and facilities. All suppliers interested in doing business with the U.S. Postal Service must register in Emptoris. Suppliers can access the eRFx registration module at https://uspsesourcing.emptoris.com. Simply click on the "Register Supplier Organization" hyperlink, and follow the instructions and prompts to complete the registration process. You will need a DUNS (Dun &amp; Bradstreet) number and NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) code to register in the USPS sourcing system.</p>
<p>If you are interested in participating in the Packaging Products Prequalification of Suppliers, please send an email message to karen.e.davis@usps.gov with the Subject Line: "Packaging Products Sources Sought Notice." Please include the following information in your email message: (1) Company Name (US Companies Only); (2) Complete Mailing Address; (3) Point of Contact (POC); (4) Title of POC; (5) Telephone Number of POC; (6) email address of POC; and (7) Confirmation that you have registered in Emptoris. All expressions of interest and inquiries must be submitted by email.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background </span></strong></p>
<p>The Packaging Products RFP will potentially combine two programs, ReadyPost&reg; packaging products and Expedited Packaging Services (EPS) products.</p>
<p>ReadyPost&reg; is a retail packaging product that generates its own revenue. The USPS has created a standardized selection of generic and decorative packaging and mailing supplies imprinted with the USPS and ReadyPost &reg; logos. ReadyPost&reg; products are distributed directly to individual USPS retail locations, including Contract Postal Units (CPUs). <br /><br />EPS products are part of the USPS Expedited Services program. EPS products include three product categories: standardized, customized (co-branded or not, dimensions of envelope or box varies based on customer request), and specialized. Unlike ReadyPost&reg; products, the EPS packaging products do not generate a separate source of revenue. Revenue is generated when customers use the EPS packaging products to mail or ship via Priority Mail, Express Mail Service or Global Expedited Services. Standardized EPS products are available at USPS retail locations, including Contract Postal Units (CPUs), and USPS.com. Approximately 20 percent of EPS standardized products are distributed directly to major mailers from the fulfillment and distribution centers, with the balance distributed to individual Postal retail units. Customized and specialized EPS products are shipped to small businesses and major mailers directly from the manufacturers</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Program Statistics</span></strong></p>
<p>The table below presents key program statistics for ReadyPost&reg; and EPS packaging products. The purpose of providing these figures is to assist potential suppliers in sizing the business opportunity relative to their existing core business competencies, capabilities and capacities. The figures are approximate. Additional details will be provided during the prequalification and source selection processes.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;

<br /><strong><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strategy<br /></span></strong><br />The key objectives of this solicitation are to reduce costs and increase efficiencies across both programs, when appropriate, by leveraging supply chain synergies while preserving the unique management and operational characteristics of each program that have made them distinctly successful. Specifically, opportunities exist for supply chain consolidation in production (including inbound transportation); warehousing, fulfillment, and call center operations; and distribution (including outbound transportation). Supply chain operations and activities will be consolidated, where it makes good business sense; for instance, rationalizing the product lines (both in terms of design and specifications), leveraging production scales of economy, reducing the number of shipments, standardizing and enhancing customer service, combining warehousing operations (and potentially moving them upstream in the supply chain), streamlining fulfillment and distribution services, and realigning outbound transportation. <br /><br />When USPS previously explored opportunities to combine these two programs, actionable strategies were limited by technology constraints, as suppliers were using their own proprietary systems for supply and demand planning, production management, warehouse management, distribution and fulfillment, etc. However, the USPS is now in the process of phasing in its own technology solution for both programs, the Solution for Enterprise Asset Management (SEAM). SEAM is an Oracle web-based application designed to improve inventory tracking and visibility; implement forecasting and automatic replenishment capabilities; and standardize asset tracking. SEAM is currently in Phase 1, which includes three sub-phases. ReadyPost products are currently being tested in Phase 1A, and the anticipated implementation date is mid-January 2012. EPS products are scheduled for testing in Phase 1C, with an anticipated implementation date of September 30, 2012. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Cost of Ownership<br /><br /></span></strong>Although USPS always considers the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) when evaluating supplier proposals, the weight of TCO will be a more predominant aspect of the overall best value determination for this purchase, in addition to technical merit and supplier pricing (external costs). As such, the Postal Service envisions that supplier pricing will need to be adjusted to account for internal management, operational, and administrative costs, and these adjustments, in turn, may impact the Postal Service's overall value assessment of the proposed solutions for both program component and bundled offers. Generally, a supplier might propose a technical solution that drives down outsourced or external costs while actually increasing the total cost of ownership to the USPS. More specifically, and as an example, if USPS elects to furnish the outbound transportation, the location of a supplier's proposed warehouse and fulfillment locations/facilities may actually increase the total cost input to the product lines, which may, in the final analysis, result in more than offsetting the cost benefit of a lower supplier price. USPS is in the process of establishing a current state TCO baseline for purposes of assessing the total product cost impacts of various supplier-proposed supply chain solutions, in whole or in part. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Pre-Qualification and Solicitation Information</span></strong></p>
<p>The USPS anticipates the Packaging Products RFP will be comprised of three individual program components as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Finished Packaging Products<br />&bull; Creative/Marketing/Retail Execution (CMR)<br />&bull; Warehousing, Fulfillment, Distribution, Transportation (USPS- or supplier-furnished options), and Inbound/Outbound Call Center Operations</p>
<p>The Postal Service further anticipates allowing pre-qualified suppliers to propose on individual program components (for both ReadyPost&reg; and EPS programs - separately or combined) or on bundled combinations of program components. Subcontracting and partnering is encouraged, especially for bundled offers, particularly since an integrated solution is expected to yield a positive TCO impact for certain bundled combinations.</p>
<p>The separation of program components, even when considering bundled contract award scenarios, is necessary to evaluate the technical and economic benefits of the proposed solutions relative to both our supply chain strategy and TCO. Our application of combinatorial optimization analysis through our eSourcing application will make it possible to consider various scenarios from a TCO perspective and, ultimately, to allocate the business through one or multiple contract awards. For example, a single supplier may be awarded a contract for the entire ReadyPost&reg; program and another supplier may be awarded a contract for the entire EPS program. Alternatively, multiple suppliers may be awarded contracts for a single component or bundled components for one or both programs, or one supplier could conceivably receive the award for all components related to both programs. Furthermore, the USPS is not obligated to award contracts for all components of the solicitation. The USPS may award some or all of the business depending on the expected benefits and overall best value to be achieved. For instance, we may choose to award everything except production if we determine that our current supply chain solution for production continues to offer the USPS the best value. We may also choose to award some or all components during Phase 1, but elect not to award Phase 2 components in the same manner. The program phase-in process is described in more detail in the following section.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Program Phase-in Approach</strong></span></p>
<p>Based on the current expiration dates of the existing contracts and the separate program timelines established for SEAM implementation, the USPS has decided a flexible phased-in approach is the most suitable model for transitioning ReadyPost&reg;) and EPS to a new supply chain solution. The current ReadyPost&reg;) contract expires June 30, 2012, and the primary logistics contract for EPS expires January 31, 2013. Therefore, the USPS anticipates the ReadyPost&reg;) contract award and implementation will occur in an initial phase and EPS implementation will occur in a second or subsequent phase. The phase-in periods also need to be aligned with SEAM implementation, which will require extensive supplier flexibility and adaptability without unduly driving up external and internal implementation costs. Moreover, and as previously stated, it is possible that the USPS may consider separate component or bundled awards for both phases.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Phase 1- ReadyPost&reg;</span></strong></p>
<p>The USPS intends to partner with one or more suppliers to provide a standardized range of USPS generic and decorative branded packaging and mailing products under the USPS registered trademark ReadyPost&reg;, utilizing SEAM.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Products</span></p>
<p>ReadyPost&reg; offers customers a complete line of standard generic and decorative shipping supplies under the USPS ReadyPost&reg; trademark. The generic product line consists of a selection of standard mailing cartons, specialty boxes, tubes, envelopes, and a variety of mailing tapes and labels. The decorative product line consists of mailing cartons, bubble mailers, bubble wrap, and mailing labels and licensed image products (e.g., Toy Story, Peanuts, etc.).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Creative, Marketing, and Retail Execution</span></p>
<p>Core Team with ad hoc rate card services and option for in-store merchandising.</p>
<p>Services required or as-needed:</p>
<p>&bull; Creative: brand identity, print/design, graphic identity/design, copywriting, environmental design, new product/services innovation/development, packaging design, print publication, sales materials, planogram design/development, in-store displays/signage, sales promo kits/messaging.</p>
<p>&bull; Marketing: category management and analytics - business intelligence, competitive/market analysis, consumer/shopper insights, promotion analysis, business plan development, product assortment/placement/promotion/pricing, strategic planning, advertising support, market share growth, building brand value.</p>
<p>&bull; Retail Execution: business execution coordination, retail associate training, space management, in-store displays, stock corrections/adjustments, merchandising support.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Warehousing, Fulfillment, Distribution, Transportation and Call Center Operations</span></p>
<p>The supplier must have the capability to provide customer service for USPS retail channels by providing volume-tiered inbound/outbound call center support services.</p>
<p>USPS intends to consider various in-network and out-of-network outbound transportation solutions, with the supplier providing more or less of the transportation mixed with USPS-furnished transportation. Depending on the transportation model selected for contract award, the supplier must have the capability to provide transportation of USPS ReadyPost&reg; products to approximately 32,000 postal locations or designated delivery points, following the Postal Service's transportation scheme or the supplier's own transportation scheme, or both.</p>
<p>The supplier must demonstrate world-class production, warehouse, fulfillment, loading dock and yard operations (for full and empty trailers), comprehensive state-of-the-art technology and information systems, data collection and reporting, and established just-in-time inventory system capabilities. The supplier must also demonstrate a commitment to quality and the existence of established processes substantiating efficient and economical methodologies to maintain inventoried items at optimal levels in the designated warehouse, maximizing warehouse space and delivering products on-time to ensure availability for purchase in all USPS retail channels.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Phase 2- EPS Products</span></strong></p>
<p>The USPS intends to partner with one or more suppliers to implement an EPS solution, utilizing SEAM, in addition to other future packaging requirements/programs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Products</span></p>
<p>The EPS packaging products are offered to customers at no additional charge for use with USPS premier mailing services-Express Mail, Priority Mail, and the USPS suite of global delivery services. The Postal Service offers customers a series of unique packaging solutions ranging from corrugated boxes and envelopes, to a range of pressure sensitive tape, labels, and decals.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Creative, Marketing, and Retail Execution</span></p>
<p>The current EPS program does not currently use Creative/Marketing/Retail Execution (CMR) services. Whereas the components for ReadyPost&reg; may require offering prices for core creative, marketing and retail execution services, EPS may only require rate card prices for CMR, to be used on an ad hoc basis. Additionally, the rate card may require offers for optional CMR services, such as in-store merchandising services.</p>
<p>Ad hoc rate card services and option for in-store merchandising.</p>
<p>Services required or as-needed (same as ReadyPost&reg;).<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Warehousing, Fulfillment, Distribution, Transportation and Call Center Operations</span></p>
<p>Essentially the same as ReadyPost&reg;, recognizing, as previously stated, the potential differences in the fulfillment, distribution and transportation schemes.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements Applicable to Both Programs</span></strong></p>
<p>The Request for Proposals (RFP) will only be issued to pre-qualified suppliers and only proposals submitted by pre-qualified suppliers will be accepted for consideration.</p>
<p>The following are the basic criteria, among other criteria, the USPS will consider in pre-qualifying potential suppliers.</p>
<p>1) National Capability:</p>
<p>The supplier must have the ability to support a national network of retail locations. The supplier must demonstrate an ability to support all USPS retail channels, which include, but not limited to: 1) approximately 32,000 Post Offices located throughout the country, the U.S. territories, and military installations, 2) on-line customers from the Postal Store at USPS.com, 3) select CPU locations, and 4) for EPS shipments, the supplier must have the ability to ship directly to major mailers nation-wide.</p>
<p>2) Additional Capabilities<strong>:</strong></p>
<p>&bull; The supplier must have the resources to perform the work.</p>
<p>&bull; The supplier must have the ability to meet contract start dates and phase-in (implementation) and delivery timelines.</p>
<p>&bull; The supplier must use a documented and acceptable quality management system to monitor and measure its performance against contract requirements.</p>
<p>&bull; The supplier must have a demonstrated record of forecasting accuracy, continuous improvement, innovation, containing/reducing costs, and a customer-centric focus.</p>
<p>3) Supplier Required USPS Systems Capabilities:</p>
<p>Enterprise Data Interchange (EDI). The supplier must have EDI capabilities when submitting a proposal for the Packaging Products solicitation. The USPS provides an AFT site for business partners to PUT/deposit and GET/pick-up files. Files transmitted via this method must be encrypted with PGP.EDI. EDI is a set of standards that set a common set of formats for information in order to be exchanged electronically between two organizations doing business together (called "trading partners"). By following common standards, any organization can communicate electronically with any other because they essentially speak the same language.</p>
<p>eBuy2 is the USPS Enterprise Tool for ordering goods and services. It is an intranet-based system for the creation and approval of on-catalog requisitions. The Supplier must have eBuy2 capabilities when submitting a proposal for the Packaging Products solicitation (or be able to become capable prior to the commencement of the contract). eBuy2 is the mandatory purchase vehicle for all USPS installations with intranet access, excluding all USPS Point of Sale (POS) sites. Each ordering office must reconcile the Billing Summary Report against the orders received during a specified month. The system:</p>
<p>1) Provides a process for creation of new on-catalog requisitions <br />2) Routes on-catalog requisitions to the Supplier<br />3) Posts payments for requisitions</p>
<p>Additionally, the Supplier must have system capabilities to integrate with the USPS programs listed below and may be required to integrate with additional postal programs:<br />Facility Access and Shipment Tracking (FAST) has replaced the Drop Shipment Appointment System (DSAS). FAST enhances the drop shipment process for packaging product haulers at Postal facilities by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of appointment creation and management capabilities for the Supplier, the haulers and the USPS. <br />Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) captures transactional and audit data related to products and services for ReadyPost&reg; and EPS products down to the unit level.</p>
<p>Solution Enterprise Asset Management (SEAM) is the USPS Enterprise system for auto-replenishment and planning of Retail inventories. SEAM will send orders, receive Advanced Shipping Notices and Invoices, match orders, receipts, and invoices to authorize payment for auto-replenished inventories via standard EDI interfaces.</p>
<p>&bull; Maintains agreement information for purpose of sourcing/authorizing orders <br />&bull; Routes orders to supplier<br />&bull; Validates invoices for payment<br />&bull; Confirms and validates receipts via delivery transactions on Product Tracking System or via manual receipts in Post Offices.</p>
<p>The Supplier will receive orders for automatic replenishment of selected offices on the Point of Sale (POS) system via an EDI file.</p>
<p>The Supplier will be required to use Electronic Delivery Confirmation manifesting on all packaging product shipments.</p>

<SUBJECT>--Consumer Product Information Database
<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:pringlek@mail.nih.gov">PRINGLE, KIMBERLY D</a>
<DESC>The procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures according to FAR Part 13. It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP) to award on a sole source basis to DeLima and Associates of McLean, Virginia for the purchase of a non-exclusive license.  The specific license numbers are CPID12000, CPID13000 and CPID14000 for use of DeLima Associates proprietary Consumer Product Information Database (CPID) to be hosted on the National Library of Medicines Household Products Database web site. (No funds will be used to develop a database.)
The CPID was developed by, is maintained by, and is fully owned by DeLima Associates with no database development or maintenance funds provided by NIH except for the cost of a license for non-commercial use under certain terms and conditions.
CPID is a commercially available database that provides chemical ingredient and health effects information for over 11,000 brand name automotive, personal care, home maintenance, inside home, pet care, pesticide, hobby and crafts, home office and landscape and yard products. JUSTIFICATIONLanguage provided from SBA SBIR policy directive(7) For Phase III, Congress intends that agencies or their Government owned,contractor-operated facilities, federally-funded research anddevelopment centers, or Government prime contractors that pursueR/R&D or production developed under the SBIR Program, givepreference, including sole source awards, to the awardee that developedthe technology. In fact, the Act requires reporting to SBA of all instancesin which an agency pursues research, development, or production of atechnology developed by an SBIR awardee, with a concern other than theone that developed the SBIR technology. (See Section 4(c) (7)immediately below for agency notification to SBA prior to award of such afunding agreement and Section 9(a) (12) regarding agency reporting ofthe issuance of such award.) SBA will report such instances, includingthose discovered independently by SBA, to Congress.
(8) For Phase III, agencies, their Government-owned, contractor-operatedfacilities, or federally-funded research and development centers, thatintend to pursue R/R&D, production, services, or any combination thereofof a technology developed by an SBIR awardee of that agency, with anentity other than that SBIR awardee, must notify SBA in writing prior tosuch an award. This notice requirement also applies to technologies ofSBIR awardees with SBIR funding from two or more agencies where oneof the agencies determines to pursue the technology with an entity otherthan that awardee. This notification must include, at a minimum: (a) thereasons why the follow-on funding agreement with the SBIR awardee isnot practicable; (b) the identity of the entity with which the agency intendsto make an award to perform research, development, or production; and(c) a description of the type of funding award under which the research,development, or production will be obtained. SBA may appeal thedecision to the head of the contracting activity. If SBA decides to appealthe decision, it must file a notice of intent to appeal with the contractingofficer no later than 5 business days after receiving the agencys notice ofintent to make award. Upon receipt of SBAs notice of intent to appeal,the contracting officer must suspend further action on the acquisition untilthe head of the contracting activity issues a written decision on the appeal.The contracting officer may proceed with award if he or she determines inwriting that the award must be made to protect the public interest. Thecontracting officer must include a statement of the facts justifying thatdetermination and provide a copy of its determination to SBA. Within 30days of receiving SBAs appeal, the head of the contracting activity mustrender a written decision setting forth the basis of his or her determination.DeLima Associates is the only known source that is capable of providing a fully-functional health effects database of over 11,000 household products designed to be fully compatible with NLM-TEHIPs suite of chemical exposure databases. The database is unique in that, it compiles in one place, brand names of household products, and identifies, for each brand name, its chemical ingredients by chemical name and the chemical's universal identifier, the CAS Registry Number. This linking of brand names to individual chemical ingredients is a valuable component in integrating this information with the existing TEHIP databases that currently contain a wealth of health data on exposure to individual chemicals. In addition, for each brand, the CPID provides: acute and chronic health effects information, carcinogenicity and first aid information. The quality and accuracy of this database on NLMs Household Products Database web site is reflected in its high usage of over 35,000 page views per day. The CPID developed by DeLima Associates is the only commercially available household products health effects database approved by National Center for Environmental Health of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Although other contractors may be capable of developing and populating a new database, funds are not being provided to develop or to populate the Household Products Database, instead, funds are only being provided to purchase a non-exclusive license to use an existing commercial database owned by DeLima Associates to continue to be hosted on the Household Products Database site of NLM. Since NLM does not own the existing product database it cannot transfer the licensed data contained in the Household Products Database to any other prospective bidder. A new awardee would be required to build a database from scratch at no cost to the government. It is therefore in the best interest of the government to use the existing and updated data through a license agreement rather than expend funds to build and populate a new database.The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541511 and the business size standard is $25M. This is a 100% small business set-aside. NLM anticipates that award will be made on or about December 22, 2011.PERIOD OF PERFORMANCEThe period of performance shall be twelve (12) months from date of award with two (4) one year options.BACKGROUNDThe primary mission of TEHIP is to provide core information resources and services, facilitate access to national and international information resources, and strengthen the infrastructure for toxicology and environmental health information. In support of this mission, the Program makes available on the web a suite of databases containing both factual and bibliographic information on environmental and health effects of chemicals.The advent of the web technology made it possible for TEHIP to extend the reach of its existing databases by hyperlinking to other information resources in and outside of the government. Moreover, the web technology helped to make its information resources easily available not only to its traditional users such as toxicologists, industrial hygienists, healthcare providers, and regulatory specialists, but also to the public at large seeking information about the effects of exposures to chemical substances.CONTRACT REQUIREMENTSDeLima Associates will provide data and updates for:12,000 products under License Renewal CPID12000, 13,000 products under License Renewal CPID13000 and 14,000 products under License Renewal CPID14000. 
1.   Database Tables to be LicensedDeLima Associates will provide the following database tables under the terms and conditions of the non-exclusive license:	Brands: Brand name and product specific fields	CAS No Brands Connect: Brand names connected to its ingredient CAS numbers	Chemicals: Identify chemicals with CAS numbers or IDs	Handling and Disposal: Instructions for handling, storage and disposal of products	Health Effects: Label Warnings, First Aid, Acute and Chronic Health Effects, Carcinogenicity and Health Ratings	Manufacturers: Contact information for manufacturers	Synonyms: Synonyms for Chemicals in database	Brand and Purpose: Identification of purpose and use for each product 2.  Material Safety Data Sheets
DeLima Associates will provide the full text of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all products added with each license renewal (when available from product manufacturers.)3.  Updating of ContentDeLima Associates will update content such as the glossary and F.A.Qs and introduce new product categories as needed.This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is a RFQ available. However, if any interested party believes it has the capability to fulfill the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The capabilities statement should demonstrate that the interested party is able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.

<a href="mailto:dan.kieffner@navy.mil">POINT OF CONTACT</a>
<DESC>This solicitation is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/ and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane. 

Reference A:  NAVSEA S9310-AQ-SAF-010 

This special notice is applicable to ALL DEVELOPERS OF LITHIUM BATTERY SYSTEMS and to ALL DEVELOPERS OF SYSTEMS EMPLOYING LITHIUM BATTERIES LARGER THAN 1 KILOWATT-HOUR OF TOTAL ENERGY STORAGE.
  This is not a solicitation for lithium battery systems proposals or proposals of any other kind.   

Discussion:  Modern Warfighting systems such as manned and unmanned vehicles increasingly rely on large, high-density energy sources as the basis for new operational concepts.  Given the current state of the art, energy storage can represent extreme danger to personnel and platforms in the event of uncontrolled release of energy in various forms.  Recent high-profile failures point to the need to establish higher safety and reliability standards for these energy systems on ship platforms.  NAVSEA recently issued High Energy Storage System Integration Safety Manual SG270-BV-SAF-010 (attached) that provides a multi-disciplined approach that focuses upon platform risk reduction.
  This includes lithium battery specific risk-assessment activities along with technical and test requirements to ensure safety. Reference A defines the existing overall Navy Lithium Battery Safety program applicable to all Navy applications and also provides cell-and battery-level testing and analysis of the battery itself.  In contrast to Reference A, the subject document covers hazard characterization for NAVSEA platform-specific environments that have a bearing on casualty prevention and recovery in addition to cell-, battery-, and system-level testing.  For applications not destined for use aboard vessels, the existing approval process per Reference A will continue to be used.  For lithium batteries above 1 kilowatt-hour (kwh) to be deployed on ships, both reference A and the High Energy Storage System Integration Safety  Manual must be complied with.
  It is NAVSEA's intent to add future chapters to the safety manual as new high energy technologies mature for deployment on Navy vessels (e.g. fuel cells).

 Implementation:  Subject manual is implemented in its entirety for all new systems intended for eventual shipboard deployment with Lithium battery systems 1kwh or greater. Specifically excluded are Lithium battery systems deployed on test range support craft operating within territorial waters.  For systems currently under development, platform safety requirements of the safety manual will be tailored by NAVSEA 05 on a case basis to ensure requisite level of safety.

The resulting contract will include a base year of twelve (12) months and four one year (12 mo.) option periods with a total estimated cost for all five years between $500,000.00 and $1,000,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The NAICS code applicable to this project is <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">531390</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 12.206 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, award will be made using best-value procedures incorporating tradeoffs between price-related and non-price related factors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt and evaluation of all proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer will preclude further participation on this acquisition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Award may be made without discussions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The technical evaluation factor for the evaluation process is Technical Capability, demonstrated through product literature or other references.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">Pursuant to FAR 52.215-1 Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.</span></p>

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protests issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer of Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, DC 20593-0001, FAX: 202-475-3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

MCAGCC Access/Security Requirements-Contractor and Contractor-Employee Access Conditions:   

1.  Access Procedures Are Mandatory:  All contractor employees are required to obtain business access or permanent business access.  Daily access procedures must not be used to circumvent background check requirements outlined below.  Attempts to improperly use daily access procedures may result in denial of access to the involved employees. 

2.   Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one day to one year.
  Submit the following:  

	A valid form of Federal or state government I.D.
	If driving a motor vehicle, a valid driver's license, vehicle registration and proof
	of insurance.
	Proof of employment on a valid Government contract (e.g., a letter from the
	prime contractor including contract number and term).
	Proof of an employee background check conducted within the past year
	covering the previous two years.  Contractor employee background checks are
	conducted at contractor expense.  The background check:

(a)	must establish the employee's citizenship or legal alien status.  Acceptable documents include birth certificate, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) forms and passports.
(b)	must include proof of a criminal records check from the county or state where the employee resided for the previous two years (or length of legal residence for foreign nationals in the U.S.
 for less than two years).  
(c)	will be subject to Government verification via the FBI National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Interstate Identification Index (III).  If the background check is selected for  verification, the employee will be required to submit fingerprint records to the FBI Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) database.  NCIC checks and fingerprinting will be performed at
Government expense.

Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshals Office (PMO)  of the Combat Center.  For the MCAGCC/MAGTFTC, this process includes the completion of a COMBAT CENTER ACCESS AUTHORITY letter issued by the Regional Contracting Office (NW).
  

3.  Permanent Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one to three years.  Submit all items listed above under business access.  NCIC check and fingerprint of all contractor employees will be conducted at Government expense.  Contractor-provided background checks will be reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractors expense.

4.  Emergency Access:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities.
  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  

5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  

6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.
  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee:
	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List.
	b.    is illegally present in the United States.
c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant.
d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information.
	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations.

7.
  Employee Identification:  Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall be readily identifiable as an employee of the contractor through the use of uniforms or nametags, or via an alternate method approved by the Contracting Officer. 

8.  Employee Compliance.  The Contractors employees shall observe and comply with all MCAGCC/MAGTFTC rules and regulations applicable to contract personnel, including those applicable to the safe operation of vehicles, and shall not be present in locations not required for the proper performance of this contract. Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks. Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel.

9.
  Contract Termination:  The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

Adequate childcare personnel for as stated under the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services guidelines, 5101:2-12-20;<br><br>(1)  # of children ages birth to 12 months, with a ratio of 5 children to 1 caregiver.<br><br>(2)  # of children ages 12 months and under 18 months with a caregiver to child ratio of 1 to 6.<br><br>(3)  # of children ages 18 months and under 2   years with a caregiver to child ratio of 1 to 7. <br><br>(4)  # of children ages 2   years and under 3 years with a caregiver to child ratio of 1 to 8.<br><br>(5) # of children ages 3 years with a caregiver to child ratio of 1 to 12.<br><br>(6) # of children ages 4 and 5 years of age with a caregiver to child ratio of 1 to 14.<br><br>(7) # of children ages 6 to under 11 years of age with a caregiver to child ratio of 1 to 18.<br><br>(8) # of children ages 11 to 17 years of age with a caregiver to child ratio of 1 to 20.<br><br>I.	When there is a combination of ages within a group of children the age of the youngest child determines the staff/child ratio.  The only exception to this is that when no more than one child, two and one half years of age or older, is permanently assigned to a group in which all the other children are in the next older age group, the staff/child ratio shall be determined by the older children.<br>II.	Child care staff members shall not be counted in the staff/child ratio if they are engaged in duties that interfere with the staff's supervision of children.<br>III.	Child care staff members shall not be counted in the staff/child ratio if they are engaged in telephone conversations or conversations with parents that prevent child care staff members from adequately supervising children. <br>IV.	Supervision of children is the function of actively observing and guiding a child or group of children. This includes awareness of and responsibility for the activity of each child and being physically present and near enough to intervene if needed.  Supervision means child care staff members have knowledge of children's needs, accountability for their care, and knowledge of which children they are responsible for at all times. Supervised means that children shall be within sight and hearing of child care staff members at all times. No child shall ever be left alone or unsupervised.<br>V.	No employee shall be under the influence of any substance that impairs the employee's ability to supervise the children and/or perform the employee's duties. <br>

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

Please review these attached documents and provide any questions/comments/concerns NLT&nbsp;12:00 pm (MST) on 10 Oct 11.&nbsp;<br /><br />We would like to gain one more round of industry review and comment on our draft RFP documents prior to our release of the formal RFP on 1 Nov 11.

The contract type will become "solid" after our 13 Oct 11 brief to government leadership (Acquisition Strategy Panel Brief). We anticipate posting the final contract type and contract related documents (Section A-K, and L&amp;M) for your review and comment as soon as possible after the internal government meeting. <br /><br />We appreciate your interest in our acquisition and applaud your patience in waiting for us to post documents.

<p>b) In accordance with FAR 19.101(7) if the anticipated value of a contract exceeds one-half the size standard for a NAICS that carries a revenue based size standard, then for purposes of determining small business status the applicable size standard applies to individual concerns (businesses), not to the combined assets of a Joint Venture or Teaming Arrangement.</p>
<p>The NAICS code (541690) applicable to the small business set aside portion of the BioWatch SETA is a revenue based size standard ($7.0M) and the anticipated value of the contract is in excess of one-half the size standard.</p>
<p>Accordingly, if a Joint Venture or Teaming Arrangement is formed for purposes of responding to the small business set aside portion of the BioWatch SETA, then the size standard will be applied to the individual businesses, not to the combined assets of the Joint Venture or Teaming Arrangement. That means that a Joint Venture or Teaming Arrangement between an Other than Small Business (large business) and small business is impermissible, and that in order for the Joint Venture or Teaming Arrangement to be considered small *ALL members of the Joint Venture or Team MUST BE small businesses.* Additionally, even if not part of a small business Joint Venture or Teaming Arrangement, a large business cannot be affiliated with a small business. If affiliation is found, small business size standards cannot be met. Business concerns are affiliates of each other if one has the potential to control the other.</p>
<p>The limitations on forming Small Business Joint Ventures or Teaming Arrangements do not extend to subcontracts with large businesses. A Small Business Joint Venture or Teaming Arrangement entity may subcontract with large businesses subject to FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, and retain its status as a small business.<br />Additional information on small business Joint Ventures is accessible at the following links:</p>
<p>http://web.sba.gov/faqs/faqindex.cfm?areaID=15</p>
<p>http://www.sbaonline.sba.gov/contractingopportunities/officials/size/faq/index.html</p>
<p>c) The Government anticipates releasing a draft of the solicitation for the full and open portion of the BioWatch SETA subsequent to release of the small business set aside solicitation. A draft of the solicitation for the full and open portion is anticipated to be released in the second quarter of FY12. The Government also anticipates holding an industry day following release of the draft solicitation to provide industry with a better understanding of the requirement.</p>
<p>Please note that a solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. Please continue to monitor FedBizOpps for updates on the BioWatch SETA acquisition.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because a statute exists that expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made from a specific source or through another agency (FAR 6.302-5); specifically, Sole source awards under the 8(a) Program. Per FAR 6.302-5 a J&A is not required for this award.<br><br>This requirement consists of the construction of an apron extension to the south of the existing West Ramp Area and Taxiway Hotel on Holloman Air Force Base to park an F-16 Aircraft.  The new apron is sized at 5,690 square meters or 61,247 square feet to accommodate six F-16 parking positions.  Each parking position will have a sunshade structure built with lighting, power, and grounding systems.  Aircraft tie-downs and grounding for aircraft and fuel trucks will be designed into the new pavement.  A twenty-five foot asphalt shoulder will surround the new pavement.  Site improvements include grading, drainage, and demolition of existing power panel.  An 8" water line and existing communication duct bank will be relocated as part of this project.  Existing airfield edge lighting will be modified and new apron signage will be added.  Pavement striping for aircraft movement is additionally part of this project.  This project will be designed to achieve silver certification to the United States Green Building Council (USGBC).  LEED Silver Certification is required.

<AWARDEE>WORLD WIDE TECHNOLOGY, INC.;60 WELDON PKWY;MARYLAND HEIGHTS;MO;630433237
<DESC> JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
       Office of Acquisition and Logistics
       Center for Acquisition Innovation - Austin
       1701 Directors Blvd., Suite 600
       Austin, TX  78744
         
2.	Description of Action:  This proposed action is for a Firm-Fixed-Price Delivery Order (DO) issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC), for a Network Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) solution that will protect VA traffic traversing the VA Wide Area Network (WAN) and the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) as well as the Region 2 and 3 networks.  This will be an inline device used to monitor network traffic for vulnerabilities, network attacks, buffer overflows and be capable to prevent these attacks. Additionally, maintenance support is required for the aforementioned solution. The period of performance for the maintenance support will consist of a one year base period with three, 1-year options.    

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  The proposed action will provide a device, which has in line service speeds of 150 mbps as well as provide capture of pre- and post-event traffic for analysis. It must also be 'host-aware' in that if vulnerable traffic is detected to a patched and protected system, that this event will be intelligently ignored. It must provide integration with Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and Active Directory. It must be able to be easily compatible for submission of real time events to a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) product. It must have the ability to scan for PII data. It must be able to have SNORT intrusion prevention rules imported and have 'Open Signatures', meaning that code for all signatures must be viewable and editable as well as the ability to create custom signatures easily. 

The IPS solution must be capable of monitoring and detecting attacks on Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) networks.  It must be able to provide real time auto tuning of IPS rules gathered from host information.  The IPS needs to be able to activate, and if needed, block on rules depending on host information.   IPS solution must have built in NetFlow monitoring of all seven layers of the network protocols.

Additionally, maintenance support is required to ensure the aforementioned solution remains operational.  The total estimated price of the proposed action, inclusive of the base year and all option years, is <redacted>.  

  

4.	Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(j)(b) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(B), "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized."

5.	Reason for Authority Cited:  Based on extensive market research, as described in paragraph 8 of this document, it was determined that limited competition is available for this brand name item and service. Sourcefire Realtime Network Awareness Host Data is able to pull host information from nmap and Nessus scans to determine if IPS signatures will be applicable or not. This is valuable in the reduction of false positives. The IPS is also able to analyze the host data to automatically activate applicable signatures in monitor and block mode if necessary. The IPS is unique in that it can provide NetFlow monitoring and be able to provide IPv6 monitoring.  

6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  Limited competition is anticipated for the required brand name items and maintenance.  Furthermore, in accordance with FAR 5.3 the contract award will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Page.  In addition, this Justification and Approval (J&A) will be made publicly available on the FBO page.

7.	Actions to Increase Competition:  Although the Government is limiting competition as a result of specifying a brand name item, there are authorized resellers of these products on the NASA SEWP IV GWAC.  Limited competition for this requirement among these vendors is anticipated.  Accordingly, this J&A and the Request for Quote will be submitted to all four (4) groups on the NASA SEWP IV GWAC in order to fully notify all interested parties and obtain price competition.  Any quotations received will be evaluated.  Furthermore, in order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the agency will work with the program office to perform additional market research in a timely manner so that other solutions can be considered.

8.	Market Research:  National Data Center Program/Corporate Data Center Operations staff consulted with Gartner Group to determine if there were viable products from other manufacturers besides Sourcefire to meet VA requirements of IPS.  As a result, additional market research was conducted with three other contractors (IBM-ISS, Enterasys, and Tipping point) to confirm that the current requirement for Sourcefire was the best value to the Government.  Market research was conducted by VA via phone calls to vendors on the NASA SEWP IV GWAC to ensure this solution was available on contract.  Based on this market research, limited competition is expected for the proposed action.  As stated above, the Sourcefire IPS solution meets the VA requirements.  

9.	Other Facts:  The Sourcefire Intrusion Prevention System/Intrusion Detection System is currently available and in production in the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC).  VA is currently expanding it into Philadelphia and Hines Information Technology Centers as well as the consolidated VistA sites in order to expand the architecture to accommodate the increased capacity needs that are anticipated due to the national data center consolidation project.
