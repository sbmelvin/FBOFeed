If bidding on all items is not required, bidders should insert the words "no bid" in the space provided for any item on which no price is submitted.<br />(d) Alternate bids will not be considered unless this solicitation authorizes their submission.<br />The IFB issue date is approximately 11 Apr 2011 and closing date is 26 May 2011. Site visit date will be noted in the solicitation. All interested parties are highly encouraged to attend the site visit.

The Contractor will perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals, and CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare program. The Medicare program has complex legal, policy, and operating environments, and the Contractor will utilize and interact with all pertinent CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment, and operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor will not only coordinate its activities with CMS, but must also work with a broad range of Federal, State, and Local government agencies, CMS partners and Contractors, and any other stakeholder in the health care system of the United States.</p>
<p>In accordance with CMS' technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from institutional and professional providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction and will perform all standard or otherwise required editing on these claims to determine whether they are complete and ready for payment. An edit is defined as "logic within the Standard Claims Processing System (or PSC/ZPIC Supplemental Edit Software) that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review."</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor will calculate Medicare payment amounts and remits these payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor also will conduct redeterminations on appeals of claims; operate a Provider Customer Service Program (PCSP) that educates providers about the Medicare program and responds to provider telephone and written inquiries; respond to complex inquiries from Beneficiary Contact Centers (BCCs); and make coverage decisions for new procedures and devices in local areas. The Contractor also will conduct a variety of different provider services, such as enrolling new providers in the program, answering written inquiries, and educating providers on Medicare's rules, regulations, and billing procedures.</p>
<p>CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for Jurisdiction H (comprised of the states of Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico) on or about January 27, 2011. The contract will include a base year plus four one-year options. The anticipated proposal due date is March 17, 2011 with an anticipated award date of July 15, 2011.</p>
<p>This solicitation is expected to be issued as pending availability of funds.</p>

<DESC>This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR)or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Furthermore, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a six month sole source extension to contract DTFAWA-06-P-0001 to ARINC, Inc. under the provisions of FAA Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4 in order to continue necessary support for the FAA's Aviation Weather Research Program (AWRP).  
Under this contract, ARINC currently provides the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) certain aircraft-measured weather data as well as pilot reports.  The data is delivered electronically to NCAR via a dedicated communications circuit between ARINC and NCAR.  The data is time critical and directly supports real-time National Airspace System (NAS) operations.
In addition, ARINC provides NCAR with an uplink capability for product dissemination to aircraft in flight.  ARINC's existing Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) is used for this purpose. 
This action is necessary in order to ensure the continuity of these services and prevent disruption to National Airspace System (NAS) programs.  This contract extension will allow the FAA to maintain continuity and consistency in its services until a new contract vehicle is put in place.  
If your firm believes it can fulfill the requirement, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience in providing the services outlined above and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly.  
This announcement is for informational purposes only.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Todd Pennington, Contracting Officer, by Friday, March 11, 2011 at 3 pm, EST.  Responses may be submitted via email to todd.pennington@faa.gov.

<DESC>This announcement advises that FAA will hold a technical conference with industry regarding a proposed FAA test procedure for qualification of vendor manufactured airport ADS-B vehicle squitter units.  The purpose of the conference is to present the FAA proposed test procedures and elicit industry feedback.
The FAA Surveillance and Broadcast Services (SBS) Program Office posted Announcement Number 9690 entitled "Vehicle Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) - Draft Specification and Advisory Circular" on July 2, 2010.  The announcement detailed FAA's plans to establish specification requirements for use of ADS-B equipment on airport surface vehicles, aside from aircraft, in order to mitigate safety risks on airport movement areas.  These specification requirements would apply to vehicles equipped with the ability to transmit Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) messages.  The transmitted messages would be displayed on traffic displays for both air traffic control and aircraft operators who choose to equip with the ability to receive ADS-B information.  
This effort will not result in an FAA acquisition.  As stated in the July 2, 2010 announcement, the specification provides the basis for manufacture of the vehicle squitter units.  The vehicle squitter units would be qualified through FAA testing.  Airport authorities would purchase the vehicle squitter units from FAA qualified vendors.  Use of vehicle squitter units at airports is not mandatory; however, airport authorities have expressed interest in utilizing vehicle squitter units.  
As a result of the July 2, 2010 announcement, FAA received industry comments and updated the draft specification appropriately.   
By FAA Announcement Number 10236 dated December 3, 2010, FAA conducted an Industry Day on December 17, 2010 in order to familiarize attendees with the vehicle ADS-B specification and the proposed FAA vehicle squitter units test approach.  Announcement 10236 also included the updated specification, as well as a matrix of comments received.    
As a result of Industry Day and one-on-one discussions, vendors suggested that the proposed test approach might be overstated resulting in higher cost to both vendors and the FAA.  In response to that suggestion, FAA is proposing and solicits feedback on a test procedure where vendors who manufacture avionics would be able to minimize the test impact through FAA acceptance of certain factory tests satisfactorily performed during avionics development.      
FAA will hold an ADS-B vehicle squitter unit test discussion at the FAA Technical Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey on March 22, 2011 from 0900 to 1500.  The purpose will be to present an overview of the proposed test procedures and receive industry input regarding methods to streamline the test process.  
A tour of selected portions of the FAA Technical Center facilities will also be conducted.  
The ADS-B vehicle squitter unit draft test procedures which includes the Verification Traceability Requirements Matrix (VRTM) is attached hereto as well as the current specification.  The draft test procedures reflect the traditional FAA test philosophy.  Attendees should familiarize themselves with these documents prior to the Technical Center meeting.  
Interested parties are asked to contact Ms. Amy Kirkham at akirkham@regulus-group.com in order to confirm attendance.  Attendance may be limited due the size of the conference area; therefore prompt responses are advised.  In addition, one to two weeks should be allowed for processing of required personnel security clearances.  Vendors should indicate if they currently have proper credentials for access to the FAA Technical Center. 
The July 2, 2010 and December 3, 2011 FAA announcements can be accessed at http://faaco.faa.gov/ with archiving keyword "vehicle transponder".  Interested parties should access this site for background information. 
All communications and questions shall be directed to Stephen B. Manley by E-mail at:  Steve.Manley@FAA.gov.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address<br /> Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National 	Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, 	Room 6072, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br />Description<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB), plans to procure the brand name Applied Biosystems 5500xl SOLiD Sequencer upgrade manufactured by Applied Biosystems, 850 Lincoln Centre Dr., Foster City, CA 94404.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard in 500.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Delivery:  4-5 weeks after receipt of purchase order</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide One 5500xl-u Sequencer Upgrade from SOLiD 4 which includes the 5500xl SOLiD Sequencer and workstation computer, instrument control software, and sequencer accessories.</p>
<p>The government will be trading in the SOLiD 4, serial number 1380000145.</p>
<p>Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>1.  Statutory authority:</p>
<p><br />Statute:  This acquisition is conducted under the authority of section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(1).</p>
<p>(b) Soliciting from a single source.</p>
<p>(1) 	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).</p>
<p>No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.</p>
<p><br />AB has improved their sequencing capacity since the instrument was installed. The newly improved 5500xl SOLiD System includes better and faster sequencing chemistry, higher throughput by increasing bead density and updated software. The other improvement of the upgrade consists of better QC and reduced reagent costs. In summary, 5500xl SOLiD<sup>TM</sup> System will make the sequencing faster, more accurate, higher throughput and thus cost-efficient for the Oncogenomics Section.</p>
<p>AB is the major leading manufacture in sequencing technology and the human genome project had been completed mainly using the AB sequencing technology based on Sanger method. AB has launched its next-generation sequencer, SOLiD in October 2007 and the performance of this sequencer has been proven to be exceptional. The Oncogenomics Section has been using AB SOLiD next-generation sequencers since 2008 to perform genomic analyses of pediatric tumors.  Up to date, the AB SOLiD platform still has advantages over other platforms in terms of accuracy and throughput.  The NCI has invested heavily in accessory equipments to support SOLiD sequencers, and built bioinformatics pipelines for analyzing SOLiD data. Therefore, it is imperative that the equipment is compatible with existing accessory equipments in order to maintain continuity in data.  In order to complete the on-going genomic studies in pediatric cancers in the Oncogenomics Lab in a faster, more throughput and cost-effective manner, the NCI plans to purchase the upgrade of 5500xl SOLiD System. Since AB is the only manufacturer for the SOLiD system and they own patents on the instrumentation and technology, AB is the only known vendor that can provide this upgrade.</p>
<p>The salient characteristics that apply to the AB SOLiD 5500xl are:<br />&bull;	99.99% accuracy with the exact call chemistry module from current 99.9% accuracy.<br />&bull;	Independent flow channels allow independent sample sequencing, thus save reagents and time.<br />&bull;	Faster speed to complete a paired-end run in 7 days vs. current 12 days <br />&bull;	Reduced reagent cost per Gb sequencing</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on March 18, 2011.  No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax). An original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Ward, Contract Specialist, atwardmr@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference solicitation number NCI-1100138-MW on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to UVP, LLC, 2066 W. 11th Street, Upland, California 91786-3509 to procure a Biospectrum 500 Imaging System.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives.  The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) has begun transitioning into the broader scope, TRND. TRND is accountable for the authentication of novel compound probes through the validation of existing assays (cell and biochemical), development of novel assays, animal studies, and eventually support of human clinical trials that will ultimately lead to the discovery of a pharmaceutical drug. The TRND research laboratory is responsible for the development of target specific cell based assays for rare and neglected diseases, while maintaining full system compatibility with the automated robotic qHTS facility at the NCGC. This will insure that assays transfer and developed between the two laboratories can be immediately implemented in small and large scale drug discovery campaigns with confidence.  

The TRND research laboratory will extend applications related to Cellomics, Genomics, and Proteomics.  Our area of work will involve handling of DNA, RNA and protein samples. In order to perform our experiments we are in dire need of an imaging system that will enable us to document our results and right now we do not have a gel documentation system.  In order to extend beyond the existing technology available to NCGC we need to purchase the Biospectrum 500 Imaging System from UVP, LLC in order to execute the new program initiatives that our group will explore as being a part of TRND.  This request is required for this Laboratory in order to develop and deploy new technology and assays for the screening of rare and neglected disease targets.

The BioSpectrum Imaging System is one powerful unit that enables multiple applications including imaging of chemiluminescent (Westerns, Northerns and Southerns), fluorescent, bioluminescent and colorimetric samples in various formats (plate,gel, blots). Chemiluminescent imaging of protein blots using the BioSpectrum greatly speeds up and simplifies analysis. Once positioned on the imaging platform, the membrane is focused, door closed and the image is captured with a one button preset in VisionWorksLS. Multiple captures are easily taken to get a full range of exposures using the Sequential Integration feature. Chemiluminescent imaging of protein blotting and the sensitivity of this procedure compares to film showing the BioSpectrum with cooled BioChemi 500 camera to be superior to film in sensitivity, accuracy, dynamic range, speed, and simplicity. Due to the high sensitivity and resolution of the BioSpectrum 500 system, the resultant image is both quantitative and publication quality.  The UVP, LLC Biospectrum software uses a template creation feature that allows the user the ability to store settings such as stage height, exposure time. The unit has a motorized stage that is raised and lowered by the computer so the sample can be as close to the lens as possible, important when running Western blots. The purchase of the Biospectrum 500 system is the only choice for NCGC/TRND Laboratory, no other substitutes will satisfy this requirement.

This is set-aside for a small business. Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 335129, Other Lighting Equipment Manufacturing, with size standard of 500 employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001).and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-48 (January 31, 2011). 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by March 8, 2011, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.

Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2011-120-DLM, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition,   COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Dorothy Maxwell.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Bellbrook Labs, LLC, 5500 Nobel Drive, Suite 250, Madison Wisconsin, 53711-1089 to procure GDP Fluorescence Polarization and GDP Alexa Tracer.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives.  The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) mission is to apply the tools of small molecule screening and discovery to the development of chemical probe research tools, for use in the study of protein and cell functions, and biological processes relevant to physiology and disease. The reagents are needed to screen chemical libraries for inhibitors against g-alpha proteins and regulators of g-protein signaling (RGS). The importance of RGS proteins are that they are highly localized and in the human brain, makes this family of proteins attractive targets for pharmacotherapy of central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as Parkinsons disease, schizophrenia, and anxiety. 

All the assay optimization was performed with the two major components in the Transcreener GDP (Guanosine diphosphate) kit (which measures GDP levels), the GDP Antibody and GDP Alexa 633 Tracer. Going forward, the screening needs to be done with the same reagent to yield comparable and readily interpretable results. A switch to a different detection reagent would necessitate re-optimizing the assay. GDP Alexa 633 tracer shows a more robust signal in the RGS assay. NCGC is using components of the detection kit to screen chemical libraries for GDP formation present in this reagent.  The volumes requested are needed to screen about 2,000 1,536 well plates.  NCGC is requesting Bellbrook Labs GDP Kit and Alexa 633 Tracer and no other substitution is acceptable.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Florida intends to issue a sole source purchase order using the simplified acquisition process to Wind River Systems, 500 Wind River Way, Alameda, California 94501-1171.  The purchase is for One (1) ea.

  P/N 535-103796.   Currently, Wind River Systems is the only manufacturer of VX Works in the configuration required to support the LCAC C4N Software Support Activity.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition as the Government does not own the technical data packages or specifications to compete the procurements.  The items requested have been tested, certified, and approved for Navy Use and are the only known items that fulfill the LCAC C4N use requirements.  Although other manufacturers or equipment providers may supply this type of software, they have not been tested or certified for use in the LCAC.  Therefore, to ensure operational capability and compatibility with other LCAC components, purchase action must be limited to Wind River Systems.
  In accordance with FAR 13.5, a firm fixed price type award is anticipated.  Delivery will be via electronic download.   NAICS Code 511210 applies, FSC is 7030.  SBA size standard is $25 Million.  Questions can be addressed to sharon.hess@navy.mil.  Award will be based on responsive proposal at a fair and reasonable price.  Anticipated award date is 16 March 2011.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Air Force is seeking sources for a potential 100 percent set-aside for HUBZone or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns. IF ADEQUATE RESPONSES ARE NOT RECEIVED, THE ACQUISTION MAY BE SOLICIATED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS. <strong>This is a sources sought notice for planning purposes only.</strong>
<p>This requirement is for the renovation of INVENT Building 20019 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This project renovates an existing 240' x 60' steel structure, masonry infill building constructed in 1927, into a modern test facility for propulsion research. Included in this project are interior demolitions of existing concrete equipment support and first floor slab areas, new interior structural members, exterior brick, masonry and window refurbishment, new HVAC system, new electrical and communication systems, new mezzanine for data collection offices , and new sprinkler/fire alarm mass notification systems. Also included in this project is a continuation of the research air piping system supported on exterior pier structures into the building test stand platforms.</p>
<p><strong>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS:</strong> Building 20019 has been identified as a candidate for listing on the United States National Register of Historic Places. Preservation of the exterior is of high concern. Because of the deteriorated condition of the brick, masonry, and steel framed windows due to age, the contractor needs specialty experience in the repair and refurbishment of these items. Experience working with Historic Preservation Guidelines and the State of Ohio Preservation Office is suggested.</p>
<p>With a building of this vintage, and the scope of renovation, experience is also suggested with environmental hazards remediation including lead based paint, asbestos containing material, etc. The research air system is a specialized application. The contractor should have experience in ASME B31.3 process piping code and appropriate welding certifications. This project includes furniture, and has four separate funding sources and should be bid accordingly. Refer to the bid schedule for more detail. The facility is currently unoccupied and will remain that way until construction is complete.</p>
<p>There will be furniture involved in this project. However, most of the furniture deals with ten workstations which are to be tied into the building systems (i.e., electrical, communication, data, etc.).</p>
<p>In addition, contractors must have:<br />&bull; Experience with renovation of historic buildings.<br />&bull; Experience with environmental hazard (asbestos and lead paint) remediation <br />&bull; Experience in process piping (ASME B31.3).</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 420 calendar day period of performance. The estimated magnitude of the entire contract is over $10,000,000.00</p>
<p>Prime contractors who are HUBZone or SDVOSB and who intend to submit a bid for this solicitation MUST submit the following by 4:00 p.m. (local Dayton time) on Friday, 18 March 2011.<br /><br />Responses should include the following: <br />(1) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this solicitation as a Prime Contractor; <br />(2) date of HUBZone certification; and <br />(3) Documentation of SDVOSB status; and<br />(4) listing of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact with their phone numbers, and an explanation of the relevancy of the project; <br />(5) Documentation from surety or their agent of your capability to be bonded for bid, performance and payment bonds for this project;<br />(6) If you are a HUBZone considering a joint venture that has not been formalized, you will need to specify the firm(s) you intend to partner with and how you plan to officially form the joint venture.</p>
<p>Firms interested should provide the above documentation, fax or e-mail responses will be accepted. All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on the availability of interested HUBZone or SDVOSB concerns. Responses shall be limited to 5 pages. Please include your DUNS Number and CAGE Code on your response.</p>
<p>Failure to submit all information requested would result in a contractor being considered "non-responsive" in this requirement. A decision on whether this will be pursued as a set-aside or an unrestricted basis will be posted as a modification in Federal Business Opportunities.</p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, management, and financial capability of such offerors to perform this type of work.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside is warranted or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is: 541620, Environmental Consulting Services.  The small business size standard for NAICS Code 541620 is $7 million. The purpose of the proposed project is for soil moisture monitoring at select Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation Program (MSCP) Habitat Creation and Restoration Sites.   The contractor must provide all personnel, equipment, tools and materials supervision and other items and services necessary to perform soil moisture monitoring at an estimated 300 to 500 acres of land.      The need for microclimate and soil moisture data associated with wildlife species and their surrounding habitat is unarguably of primary importance to any habitat creation and restoration program. Microclimate, including soil moisture, is known to influence wildlife species' use of riparian habitat. Likewise, riparian habitat could not exist without sufficient soil moisture needed to support this complex system. 
In order to effectively evaluate the habitat at select habitat creation sites, microclimate data are needed for correlations with vegetation data that in turn can help explain the presence or absence of MSCP covered species.Soil moisture is one of the most important variables when measuring the following; planting success (mortality), changes in size and structure of plants, community composition, and soil quality attributes. Should you be interested in this effort, please submit a capability package to Brian Switzer at the address listed below.  Capability statements are to be submitted no later than March 4, 2011.  The capability statement shall address the work listed above, demonstrate the company's capability to perform the work,  describe previous procurements performed of similar size and complexity, and to provide examples of past performance related to soil moisture monitoring.   Additionally, all responses to this sources sought shall include company name and address, business size and type (8(a), HubZone, Small Business, etc), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number.   Capability statements shall not exceed five pages in length.  This information will be used to assist the Contracting Officer in developing the procurement strategy, in particular, including whether an 8(a) or Hubzone set-aside is warranted or if another socio-economic set-aside strategy is more appropriate.  All responses to this sources sought notice shall be provided to Brian Switzer/LC-10114, Contract Specialist, P. O.  Box 61470, Boulder City, NV 89006-1470 or via e-mail bswitzer@usbr.gov.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes. No formal solicitation exists at this time.  This information presented in this announcement will not obligate the Bureau of Reclamation in any manner.  The Estimated Price is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.
 All qualified concerns that may be interested in performing the proposed project may submit capability statements for consideration.  Based upon response to this announcement and capability statements, the Government may determine to set this acquisition aside, proceed with an unrestricted solicitation or decide on an alternate procurement strategy.  
The Proposed Project:  The intent of the project is to construct a reinforced concrete fish barrier on Blue River, approximately  mile north of the confluence of the Blue and San Francisco Rivers, within a roadless area in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. Vehicles will not be allowed to drive to the site. Vehicular access is prohibited within 8 miles of the fish barrier site. A separate construction staging area near Clifton, AZ will need to be established to support construction activities on the project site. Air support is expected to be necessary.
Construction of the fish barrier will include: diversion of surface flows, foundation dewatering,  excavation, placement and compaction of backfill, placement and removal of concrete forms, placement of concrete reinforcing bars, drilling holes for and placement of anchor bars into surrounding rock formations, placement of approximately 1,200 cubic yards of reinforced concrete, 6,000 cubic yards of roller compacted concrete, construction of an armored flood berm and cleanup of the site and removal of all waste materials at the end of the project. Length of construction contract is 180 days.
Contractors must show evidence of the following criteria:1.	Bonding capacity.2.	Experience in the last five years with heavy civil construction in extremely remote areas.3.	Experience in the last five years with roller compacted concrete construction.4.	Experience in the last five years with remote aggregate processing operations.5.	Experience in the last five years with diversion of streams and riverbed dewatering operations.

History of the Proposed Project:  The proposed Blue River native fish restoration project complements similar projects being implemented by Reclamation and other agencies to assist in the recovery and conservation of federally-listed fish and amphibian species in the Gila River Basin. Reclamation's fish barrier construction program is mandated by a May 15, 2008 US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) biological opinion (BO) that addressed delivery of water through the Central Arizona Project (CAP) and its potential to introduce and spread nonnative aquatic species in the Gila River Basin.  A key conservation measure of the BO requires the construction of fish barriers to "prevent or hinder upstream movements of non-indigenous fish and other [nonnative] aquatic organisms into high-value native fish and amphibian habitats" during the 100-year life of the CAP. Potential fish barrier sites were selected primarily "to protect existing populations of listed fishes or facilitate the repatriation and stocking of native fishes" into suitable habitat to achieve enhanced status toward recovery.
Sources should submit statements showing ability as a prime contractor and construction services on similar projects as identified above.
Should you be interested in this requirement, please submit a capability package to Deborah Talbert at the address listed below.  Capability statements are to be submitted no later than March 15, 2011, 3:00 PM PST.  The capability statement shall address the work listed above and the company's ability to meet the qualification requirements with this type of work.   It should also describe previous procurements performed of similar size and complexity.  Additionally, all responses to this sources sought notice shall include company name and address, and represent whether it is a small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business concern, DUNS number and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number.   Capability statements shall not exceed five pages in length.  This information will be used to assist the Contracting Officer in terms of developing the appropriate procurement strategy for this acquisition.

<DESC>This "Sources Sought" posting is for market research purposes only, any solicitation resulting from this market research will be competed through the issuance of a separate Request for Quote at a later date. Your request to provide a demonstration in response to this posting will be reviewed and considered by the government, but note that not all requests may be granted. A representative sampling will be chosen and may be limited due to various reasons such as time constraints and the same software being presented by multiple re-sellers. <br /><strong><br />Date: March 21-22, 2011<br />Location: Embassy Suites, 900 10th Street NW, Washington, DC, 20001<br />Audience: Approximately 25 Government Personnel<br /></strong><br /><strong>Background<br /></strong>Through various Presidential and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directives , Federal agencies have been directed to detect and prevent improper payments through a Do Not Pay List (DNPL). These directives require the establishment of a DNPL to serve as a source through which all agencies check the status of a potential contractor, grantee, or beneficiary by linking the agency to relevant eligibility databases, to the extent allowed by law.
<p>The objective for this Vendor Day is to conduct market research to identify possible solutions, which will assist with eligibility determination in order to prevent an improper payment from being made to ineligible recipients. In the case where an improper payment is made, the solution should assist with detecting the payment, so that appropriate action can be taken.<br /><br /><strong>Improper Payments Defined<br /></strong>An improper payment is any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements. Incorrect amounts are overpayments and underpayments (including inappropriate denials of payment or service). An improper payment includes any payment that was made to an ineligible recipient or for an ineligible service, duplicate payments, payments for services not received, and payments that are for the incorrect amount. In addition, when an agency's review is unable to discern whether a payment was proper as a result of insufficient or lack of documentation, this payment must also be considered an error.</p>
<p>The term "payment" in this guidance means any payment (including a commitment for future payment, such as a loan guarantee) that is:</p>
<p>1. Derived from Federal funds or other Federal sources; <br />2. Ultimately reimbursed from Federal funds or resources; or <br />3. Made by a Federal agency, a Federal contractor, a governmental or other organization administering a Federal program or activity.</p>
<p>This includes Federal awards subject to the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C. Chapter 75) that are expended by both recipients and sub-recipients.</p>
<p><strong>High-Level Requirements<br /></strong>Vendor should have the capability to design and host a single Do Not Pay Portal, in which Federal agencies can quickly and efficiently access distributed databases, in order to verify eligibility information for various government programs.</p>
<p>Vendors should be able to quickly demonstrate an existing Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) analytic platform, via either Software as a Service or a stand-alone system. These services or products must demonstrate the ability to detect and potentially prevent improper payments, by applying fuzzy logic, to compare specified criteria against data maintained in the distributed databases mentioned above.</p>
<p>These programs are exceedingly complex, maintaining large databases, and will require a solution that can conduct timely and accurate analysis. Examples of existing solutions/customers are required.</p>
<p>Since the requirements for this project are still being defined, the above mentioned product/service may require the vendor to create a database, on which to run the analysis. The database will need to pull data from various existing databases, while only duplicating data necessary to conduct the analysis. The data, which is pulled from the distributed databases, may be in a non-standard form, requiring the product to structure the data, prior to entering it into the database.</p>
<p><strong>Vendor Day Specifics<br /></strong>Vendors should limit attendance to five personnel. Included in the vendor representatives should be enough technical expertise to provide a good overview of the product/service and to address technical concerns, as well as, compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines.</p>
<p>Equipment that will be provided by the Vendor Day host (Bureau of the Public Debt) includes:<br /><br />&bull; Laptop computer with MS Office 2007.<br />&bull; Projector.<br />&bull; Screen.<br />&bull; Internet connection.</p>
<p>Presenters will be responsible for operating the computer; and anything other than the equipment listed above will need to be provided by the presenters.</p>
<p>Demonstration Methods:<br />Live demonstrations of existing solutions are the only acceptable forms of presentation.</p>
<p><strong>To Schedule a Demonstration<br /></strong>Please email <a href="mailto:psb3@bpd.treas.gov">psb3@bpd.treas.gov</a> in response to this notice. Please be prepared to provide an organizational POC,&nbsp;so that once specific times and dates are available, that information can be relayed.</p>

<DESC>Title: <br />National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation (NHM&amp;E) Continuing Training and Materials Maintenance Project Capability Statement
<p><br />Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>This is a sources sought notice to determine the availability of potential vendors (including, but <br />not limited to, small business (e.g. 8 (a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantage business, and women-owned small business) that can provide continuing development and maintenance of training and materials, including on-line training materials, for the National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation (NHM&amp;E) and related software for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for up to 5 years.</p>
<p>Background: <br />CDC currently funds approximately 240 community based organizations (CBOs) and health departments (HDs) to provide HIV prevention programs. The Program Evaluation Branch (PEB) within the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP) has promoted the use of the National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation (NHM&amp;E) variables for standardized data collection and reporting for national and local HIV prevention monitoring and evaluation. PEB has also provided an optional web-base software, the HIV Prevention Program Evaluation and Monitoring System (PEMS), to assist grantees. The collection and analysis of standardized HIV prevention evaluation data allows CDC to report on HIV prevention efforts at the national level. Funded agencies are required to report the NHM&amp;E required data and either use PEMS or other CDC-provided software for data submission to CDC or submit data compliant with NHM&amp;E requirements and formats to satisfy the terms of their cooperative agreements. PEB also promotes the use of data for monitoring and evaluation at the local level. The PEMS software provides functionality for grantees to track their program efforts and review their own data for program monitoring and improvement.</p>
<p>Three large-scale software training sessions consisting of 18 trainings, each a week long were conducted , after each of the first major releases of the PEMS software. One representative from participating health departments and community-based organizations received the software training and related materials in order to train their staff members. Each of the training sessions focused specifically on technical skills required to implement PEMS. In addition to software training activities, CDC conducted training on HIV prevention program data collection strategies and required variables.</p>
<p>A lesson learned from these experiences was that grantees need continuing, integrated training. The training should:<br />&#61607; focus on collecting and using the NHM&amp;E data,<br />&#61607; emphasize how required data can be used for program evaluation and monitoring activities, <br />&#61607; focus on activities necessary for using PEMS or other data collection software, <br />&#61607; assist grantees to improve program planning, management, and delivery of services.</p>
<p>Due to high turn-over rates among these organizations and agencies, many participating HDs and CBOs may currently have no staff trained to use PEMS software, contributing to great variation in the level of implementation and use of the PEMS. Staff may also not have an understanding of CDC's data requirements and how data can be used for improving HIV prevention programs. Hence, CDC is currently in the process of developing NHM&amp;E training materials and presentations to cover a wide variety of needs. The goal is to develop web-based training materials that can be used by grantee staff on an as-needed, on-demand basis as self-paced learning, materials that can be used in webinars and other electronic training media, materials that can be used electronically or printed by grantees for their own use in conducting training for their own employees or contractors or as reference, and to develop and deliver training in a variety of settings (e.g., in-person, electronically, etc.). The task order to develop the initial set of materials and deliver these trainings ended December 31, 2009. A follow-on task order will end February 25, 2011. The proposed contract includes the development and completion of remaining training modules.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the NHM&amp;E requirements are evolving as the epidemic and program monitoring needs change, and since the PEMS software will also be modified or replaced to accommodate grantee requests, changes in requirements, and improvements in system function, there is also a need to continue developing the NHM&amp;E training and to maintain and improve the components of the training. This is the basis for this NHM&amp;E Continuing Training Development and Maintenance Project contract request.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives: <br />The goal for this contract is to complete, maintain, revise, improve, and expand the NHM&amp;E training to continue to provide the appropriate CDC, contracted staff, and staff at health departments and community-based organizations with the training and skills necessary to implement and utilize the NHM&amp;E variables and HIV Prevention Program Evaluation and Monitoring System (PEMS) or other government-provided reporting software for reporting to CDC and for their own monitoring and evaluation needs.</p>
<p>The purpose of this sources sought document is to assess contractor capabilities for NHM&amp;E training and materials maintenance. Specific objectives include the following:</p>
<p>1. Developing NHM&amp;E training plans and materials for approximately 240 CDCD-funded CBOs and health departments, CDC contractors, and CDC staff <br />2. Developing related materials <br />3. Providing training and technical assistance to the same groups. <br />4. Maintaining web-based access to the training materials</p>
<p>The Vendor shall demonstrate capability with the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. Demonstrate evidence of ability to develop training curricula using adult learning principles and multiple modes of communication, including web-based, on-demand training. <br />2. Demonstrate evidence of ability to development training materials that are well written and appropriate for specific audiences. <br />3. Demonstrate evidence of familiarity with HIV prevention and public health. <br />4. Demonstrate evidence of ability to develop training materials for community-based organizations and state health departments. <br />5. Demonstrate evidence of ability to maintain access to and track the use of web-based training materials. <br />6. Demonstrate evidence of ability to develop publications, presentations, and promotional materials. <br />7. Demonstrate experience in providing technical assistance to customers to meet technical needs.</p>
<p>Capability Statement:</p>
<p>Vendors that believe that they have the ability to satisfy all of the above stated objectives are encouraged to submit a capability statement. The capability statements will be evaluated based on the information provided in relation to the objectives and requirements above and the current in-house capacity to perform the work including: (a) staff availability, experience, and training; (b) prior completed projects of a similar nature; and (c) examples of prior completed contracts, dollar value of the contracts, references, and other related information.

<p>As discussed during the industry day held on 9 November 11, the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is defining its competitive acquisition strategy to procure an avionics and software integration solution to satisfy a requirement to upgrade 20 US Navy C-130T aircraft under the Avionics Obsolescence Upgrade (AOU) Program. The anticipated contract requirement is that an avionics and software integrator chosen from industry will provide hardware and software solutions to increase flight crew situational awareness, productivity and safety through the modernization of the C-130T's communication suite, flight management system, cockpit displays, navigation computers, autopilot and automatic flight control system with an integrated, open system architecture solution capable of future system and software growth. The avionics and software integrator will provide communication suite, flight management system, cockpit displays and navigation system solutions that retain specified legacy avionics communications and navigation systems. In addition, the government will specify and furnish a "B-Kit" of systems which will include, but not be limited to, the following replacement systems; color weather radar, Ultra High Frequency/Very High Frequency and High Frequency (UHF/VHF/HF) radios, Embedded Global Positioning System (GPS) Inertials, Protected Instrument Landing System (P-ILS), and Standby Instruments to be incorporated into the contractor's avionics and software integration solution. The avionics and software integration solution will reuse necessary existing aircraft systems where specified, reduce total life cycle costs and specific item obsolescence through the leveraging of existing cockpit modernization programs, fielded solutions and proven technology. Production installations of the avionics and software integration solution are not part of this requirement.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis for acquisition planning purposes; no formal solicitation for this work exists.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  The Government will use the statements as a basis for determining the availability of technical expertise and administrative and management capability to perform the effort.  

The Sealift Support Program Office (SSPO) has a requirement for the overhaul, repair, and fabrication of Side Connectors (connectors) for the Improved Navy Lighterage System (INLS). The INLS systems that use the connectors include the Roll-On-Roll-Off Discharge Facility (RRDF) and the Floating Causeway (FC) system.

2.	Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved (FAR 6.303-2(a)(2)).
This Limited Source Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) sets forth the facts and requests approval for the issuance of a Sole Source, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) commercial services contract to American Engineering & Manufacturing Inc. (AEM), a corporate entity, 8085 Leazitt Road, Amherst, OH, 44001-2711.  


3.	Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs (including estimated value) (FAR 6.303-2(a)(3)).  
AEM will provide a full-time resource to deliver information technology (IT) services in support of the VA eCMS user administration.  The resource shall be fully-trained with experience in using eCMS, and have knowledge of VA acquisition business processes and have the ability to provide direct support to eCMS users nationwide.  The term of this contract will be for one (1) year at an estimated cost of $135,600.00 per year for the base year and option year renewals for continued coverage/renewal of the contract.  


4.	Statutory Authority (FAR 6.303-2(a)(4)) - Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.
The statutory authority for this justification is FAR 6.302-1 - 
FAR 6.302-1  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 
(a) Authority. 
(1) Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). 
(2) When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for. 

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for a service-disabled, veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) firm is Public Law 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Healthcare and Information Technology Act of 2006, Sections 502, as codified at 38 U.S.C. 8127(c) - 

FAR 19.1406  Sole source awards to service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. 
(a) A contracting officer may award contracts to service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns on a sole source basis (see 19.501(d) and  6.302-5(b)(6)), before considering small business set-asides (see Subpart 19.5) provided none of the exclusions of 19.1404 apply and- 
(1) The contracting officer does not have a reasonable expectation that offers would be received from two or more service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns; 
(2) The anticipated award price of the contract, including options, will not exceed - 
(i) $6 million for a requirement within the NAICS codes for manufacturing; or 
(ii) $3.5 million for a requirement within any other NAICS code; 
(3) The requirement is not currently being performed by an 8(a) participant under the provisions of  Subpart 19.8 or has been accepted as a requirement by SBA under Subpart 19.8; 
(4) The service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern has been determined to be a responsible contractor with respect to performance; and 
(5) Award can be made at a fair and reasonable price. 
(b) The SBA has the right to appeal the contracting officer's decision not to make a service-disabled veteran-owned small business sole source award. 

819.7007 Sole source awards to service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.
(a) A contracting officer may award contracts to SDVOSB concerns on a sole source basis provided:
(1) The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will not exceed $5 million;
(2) The requirement is synopsized in accordance with FAR part 5;
(3) The SDVOSB concern has been determined to be a responsible contractor with respect to performance; and
(4) Award can be made at a fair and reasonable price.
(b) The contracting officer's determination whether to make a sole source award is a business decision wholly within the discretion of the contracting officer.  A determination that only one SDVOSB concern is available to meet the requirement is not required.
(c) When conducting a SDVOSB sole source acquisition, the contracting officer shall ensure businesses are registered and verified as eligible in the VIP database prior to making an award.


5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above (FAR6.303-2(a)(5)).
(Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.)  
The Department of Veterans Affairs intends to award a sole-source contract to work in collaboration with the eCMS PMO.  The contractor offers the following:

"	E-Mail accessibility
"	A individual knowledge in eCMS and IT
"	 Internet accessibility
"	 Phone accessibility
"	 Understanding and knowledge of the VA Acquisition policies and procedures
"	 Understanding and knowledge of the VA's eCMS PMO operations and procedures
"	Can provide eCMS Administrative Support without training 



6.	Description of Efforts To Ensure That Offers Are Solicited From As Many Potential Sources As Practicable, Including Public Notice Requirements (FAR 6.303-2(a)(6)).
(A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.)  
Market research was conducted on VetBiz Registry; no other contractors were found who could provide these eCMS support services.


7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost (FAR 6.303-2(a)(7)).  
(A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.)  
The Government will negotiate with AEM to ensure optimal terms and prices for the Government, while appropriately meeting the Veterans First Contracting Program.  The contracting officer will perform applicable and appropriate cost or price analysis to determine that the proposed price is fair and reasonable.


8.	Market Survey (FAR 6.303-2(a)8)).  
(A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.)  
Market research was conducted on VetBiz Registry; no other contractors were found who could provide these eCMS support services.


9.	Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition  (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9)).  
(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:
(i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.
(ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived.
(iii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.)  
AEM has been providing eCMS support services to the VA under contract VA798A-10-PO-0289, and their past performance has been exemplary.  An effort to secure another contractor would result in additional administrative costs and cause a disruption in the continuity of services.


10.	List of Sources, If Any, That Expressed A Written Interest In The Acquisition (FAR 6.303-2(a)(10)).  
(A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.) 
None


11.	Actions, If Any, That Are Being Taken to Remove and Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisitions for The Supplies or Services Required (FAR 6.303-2(a)(11)).  
(A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.)
The Department of Veterans Affairs anticipates limited competition amongst vendors, if deemed appropriate.


12.  Technical Requirements Personnel Certification (FAR 6.303-2 (b):
I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
 		
		Date


12.	Contracting Officer's Certification (FAR 6.303-2 (b)).
I have determined that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable and certify that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7930-00-NIB-0583<br />Name: Refills, Bathroom Cleaner and Deodorizer, Cartridge Concentrate<br />Description: Bathroom Cleaner and Deodorizor; Cartridge Concentrate Refills; 12-.2oz Cartrideges per BX</p>

<p>NSN: 7930-00-NIB-0592<br />Name: Starter Kit, Disinfectant Cleaner-Degreaser Cartridge Concentrate<br />Description: Disinfectant Cleaner-Degreaser Cartridge Concentrate Starter Kit; 6 Pre-Labeled Bottles and 12-.2oz Cartridge Refills Included</p>

<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7930-00-NIB-0583<br />Similar Items: 3410, 511-MDSSK6, 54108</p>
<p>NSN: 7930-00-NIB-0584<br />Similar Items: 3410, 554-MDSSK6, 54106</p>

<p>NSN: 7930-00-NIB-0594<br />Similar Items: 3910, 551-MDSSK6, 54109, CPC06160</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than Mach 18, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCEUSFWS Region 7
Notice of intent to award a sole source contract to: Advanced Telemetry Inc, Advanced Telemetry Inc. will provide Radio tags to complete 4th year of Togiak River Chinook Salmon Spawning Abundance, Distribution and Run-timing Study.  Specific supplies are as follows:-Two hundred (200) implant radio tags consistent with ATS model # F1840B tags with mortality codes as follows: 163.00-164.00 Mhz; Pulser R 45.8 ppm; Pulser W30 ms;weight 22 g; warranty life 63 d; battery life 127 d; antenna option 16in, 45# steel with CLR, NO FIT; bottle shape; coded with mortality circuit 8 hr.  Pulse codes to be divided between 10 of the 16 approved frequencies: Estimated value: $34,740.Shipping by May 1, 2011. 
2011 is the 4th year of the Togiak River Chinook Salmon Spawning Abundance, Distribution and Run-timing Study.  This project was initiated in 2008 with ATS coded tags and tracking equipment (receivers and antennas).  USFWS already has a substantial investment in tracking equipment for this project (9 receivers and antenna valued ~ $70,000).  Continuation of this project necessitates that new tags be trackable with this equipment.  Further, there were some recovered ATS tags from 2010 that will be deployed in 2011.  New tags for 2011 must dovetail with these existing pulse codes and frequencies.  ATS (Advanced Telemetry Systems) is a reliable and established provider of telemetry equipment for fish and wildlife applications.   ATS coded tags have a proprietary signal that only interfaces with our existing ATS tracking equipment.  Likewise, the existing ATS tracking equipment will only correctly decode ATS-manufactured coded tags.  ATS is the sole distributor of their telemetry equipment 

This Notice of Intent is not a request for Expressions of Interest (EOIs), proposals or quotations. This supply will be procured under Firm Fixed Price Supply in accordance with FAR part 12 procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized IAW FAR 6.302-1(b)(4) The anticipated award date is March 15, 2011 Point of contact for this acquisition is Randall Miller at (907)786-3466

<DESC>Solicitation Number: <br />AG-82X9-S-11-9002 Pagosa-Area Biomass Utilization Long-Term Stewardship Project
<p>Notice Type: <br />Special Notice</p>
<p>Description: <br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SYNOPSIS FOR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).</p>
<p>This notice is being used as a mechanism for obtaining comments and ideas for the purpose of creating a long-term stewardship contract that will provide fuel reduction and timber removal services needed by the San Juan National Forest in Southwest Colorado. The Government will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Request for Information. The Government is not looking to provide grants or financial assistance as a result of this request. Responses to this request will be confidential if so requested by respondent.</p>
<p>PROJECT NAME - PAGOSA- Area Biomass Utilization Long-Term Stewardship Project</p>
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: <br />The Rocky Mountain Region (R2) of the Forest Service is considering soliciting a 10 year forest restoration project for multiple project areas near the community of Pagosa Springs and surrounding Archuleta County, in southwest Colorado. Depending on contractor's capacities, one or several awards may be made. The project would be solicited under the authorities of the 16 U.S.C. 2104 Note, Stewardship End-Result Contracting Projects Act. The overall objective of the contract is to reduce hazardous fuels that increase wildland fire risk to communities and infrastructure and promote restoration of the landscape by thinning overly dense stands and removing disturbance-susceptible species. Use of stewardship authorities will allow the Forest Service to exchange the value of products removed during the land restoration activities for the cost of the treatments. The area covered by the contract will primarily be on the Pagosa Ranger District, and secondarily, the Columbine Ranger District. The Forest Service has 15,600 acres through the NEPA process at this time,</p>
<p>Recent assessments indicate that between 1.0 and 1.25 million green tons of excess trees on approximately 50,000 acres are in need of removal from forested areas where fire exclusion and insect and disease infestations have led to unsustainable forest conditions. Removal from these areas can be accomplished with conventional ground-based harvest systems. Available material may be in the form of sawlogs, small round wood, and limbs, tops, and brush. Most of the trees to be cut are green but project areas do include some standing dead. Some temporary road construction and minor amounts of specified road construction or reconstruction may be required for removal.</p>
<p>The purpose of this request is to solicit information from industry, local communities and others to help the Forest Service determine the details of the solicitation and resultant contract.<br />The USDA Forest Service will not release any information received in response to this request marked as "confidential" to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USDA Forest Service without written permission.</p>
<p>Contract Type</p>
<p>Since 2009, the Forest Service has advertised similar projects in a variety of ways. The Front Range Long Term Stewardship Contract established firm prices up front for many different types of fuel reduction services, and was awarded to one contractor. The successful contractor gets all work covered by the Front Range Long Term Stewardship Contract and the dollar amount of the individual projects (task orders) is determined by multiplying the established prices submitted in response to the solicitation by the number of acres to be treated. The Schedule of Items for this project is approximately 30 pages in length to cover all of the different types of projects that may be encountered during the 10 life of the project.</p>
<p>More recent projects on the Medicine Bow and Routt National Forests and the White River National Forest have had awards to several contractors who make up the qualified contractor pool. The contractors in the qualified contractor pool are the only contractors allowed to compete for subsequent task orders. When a project area is identified, the contractors in the qualified contractor pool are invited to a show me trip, and have the opportunity to walk the project area. The contractors then submit pricing for the project area (task order).</p>
<p>Questions - are you interested in being the only contractor awarded a contract, or will being one of several awardees work for your company?</p>
<p>If you are interested in a single award, can you give us an idea of how you think the Schedule of Items should be set up?</p>
<p>Capacity</p>
<p>One of the main factors in determining whether single award or multiple awards will be made is the capacity of the successful contractor(s).</p>
<p>Question - What is your annual capacity of sawlog, POL (products other than logs) and Biomass removal at this time? How much would you be willing to increase your capacity if awarded a contract?</p>
<p>Biomass</p>
<p>If a contractor does not remove biomass (generally this includes trees less than 5.0 inch DBH and limbs and tops from all trees), the Forest Service will have to burn the treatment areas, or piles at a later date. This increases the Forest Service's cost. These burning costs can be eliminated if the contractor can remove a significant portion of the biomass.</p>
<p>Question - if you were awarded a contract, would your plan include the removal of biomass? If so, what is the approximate cost to remove biomass?</p>
<p>Unit of Measure</p>
<p>Some previous contracts are based on per acre pricing, and the quantity of sawlogs and POL material is estimated. The contractor submits a firm price on a per acre basis, and the estimated quantity of sawlogs and POL may not be accurate. Other projects have been based on actual tons of material removed.</p>
<p>Question - which is the better unit of measure - acres or tons?</p>
<p><br />Question - What recommendations do you have for project design and implementation that could help reduce treatment costs?</p>
<p>Question - Is there other information you feel the Forest Service should consider in developing a project that will be successful in meeting the needs of industry, the Forest Service, and local communities?</p>
<p>Please feel free to provide us with any other information, comments, or ideas that may be useful in developing a successful project.</p>
<p>This is a request for information only. No formal solicitation or contract has been developed. The exact location of treatment areas and the number of acres to be treated have not been identified. The exact amount of wood or biomass to be removed has not been determined to any degree of precision.</p>
<p>Submission Requirements:</p>
<p>So that we may better determine capabilities and requirements for this prospective project, we request that you submit your answers to the questions above and any additional comments or concerns you may have by 3:00 pm Mountain Time on Monday, April 4, 2011 with "Pagosa-Area Biomass Utilization Long-Term Stewardship Project" in the subject line. Please be advised that all public information available about this requirement is provided in this notice. The preferred method of communication is by email.

<DESC>I.	Introduction<BR><BR>PM TRADE, in support of the PEO STRI, is soliciting industry, government, and academic participation related to the realization of several architectural evolution strategies across the live, virtual, or constructive training domains. These strategies, which include service-oriented architecture (SOA), cloud computing, and virtualization, are capable of improving the interoperability of current and future training systems. The software product-line architecture (PLA) framework paradigm has proven successful in minimizing stovepipe system development, and reducing system life-cycle cost and schedule.  However, as the DoD and Army strive to further reduce system life-cycle costs, and as technology improves, software PLAs must evolve further to align with future acquisition strategies and more easily adapt to advanced technology concepts. <BR><BR>A 2-day workshop will consist of an information session and facilitated discussion that will address future training architecture needs and strategies. The workshop will be held in Orlando, FL at the Partnership III building in conference room 321A/B on 3 May and 4 May, 2011 from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm each day. Additional details will follow. <BR><BR>II.	Objective<BR><BR>The key objective of this workshop is to initiate collaboration and technical exchange between industry, government, and academia involved with SOA, cloud computing, and virtualization activities within training or related initiatives.

<SOLNBR>W912QR-11-HOSPPLA
<ARCHDATE>06022011
<CONTACT>Tom Dickert, (502) 315-6177

<a href="mailto:tom.e.dickert@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Louisville</a>
<DESC>The Corps of Engineers, Louisville District, is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for a large scale construction project (exceeding $100 million) within the Dayton (Fairborn), OH area. The project consists of the design and construction of the Renovation of the Wright-Patterson AFB Medical Center to modern clinical and operational standards.  The construction entails the relocation, reorganization, and modernization of inpatient and outpatient departments consisting of clinical, surgical, support administrative and ancillary spaces. A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:  a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades;  b. The complexity of the project;  c. Shortage of skilled labor in region;  d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time;  e. The use of PLAs on other comparable projects;  f. The promotion of the Governments long term program interests, such as training of skilled workforce for future projects;  g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion;  and h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <BR>The construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:  a. Should a PLA be executed on the Dayton (Fairborn), OH Renovate Wright-Patterson Medical Center contract? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in the contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?  b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?  c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?  d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?  <BR>e. The project will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on the project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?  f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.  g. Completion of the anticipated project will require an extensive performance period. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?  <BR>h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?  i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?  Responses shall be submitted via email to Tom Dickert at tom.e.dickert@usace.army.mil no later than 1:00 PM Louisville Time (EDST) on 22 March 2011.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this survey.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

<a href="mailto:yesenia.rodriguez1@amedd.army.mil">Center for Health Care Contracting</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Health Care Acquisition Activity (HCAA), Center for Health Care Contracting (CHCC), Fort Sam Houston, Texas intends to award a cost reimbursement contract on a sole source basis to the American Registry of Pathology (ARP), 14th Alaska Ave. NW, Washington, DC  20306-0001.  The requirement is for non-personal professional and administrative support services for the National Museum of Health and Medicine (NMHM) in support of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).  The NMHM is a highly collaborative environment which comprises three integrated divisions, whose overall mission is the development, planning, analysis, management and implementation of all activities related to its holdings, their use, or any other activity related thereto.  The NMHM is the permanent steward of the nation's National Historic Landmark medical collection.  The NMHM is responsible for its cultivation and development and all activities related to its missions.  The contractor will support this mission by providing highly qualified, experienced personnel necessary to perform professional, scientific,  administrative support and courier services, seamlessly integrating current operations with transition-period and future operations.  Support includes a normal work day in addition to early, weekend, holiday, and occasional evening work, if required.  Travel to CONUS/OCONUS is required.  Through a BRAC directive, the NMHM will be relocating from the current museum location on the campus of Walter Reed Army Medical Center to existing structures located in Gaithersburg, MD and a new construction located in Forest Glen, MD.  The relocation of the NMHM entails a high degree of uncertainty and will at a minimum require increased contractor support and operations.  The basis for sole source justification is that in carrying out the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 176, the AFIP is authorized to contract with the ARP for the services of such professional, technical, or clerical personnel as are necessary to fulfill their cooperative enterprises.  Public Law 96-513 effective Dec. 12, 1980, amended 10 U.S. C. 176 to include the NMHM as a public facility of the AFIP with the purpose of displaying and interpreting the collections of the AFIP.  This effort has been performed by ARP for the last 15 years through a cost reimbursement, sole source contract under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5) and 10 U.S.C. 176(b)(1)(C), as implemented by FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute.  As such, ARP is the only contractor that can start full performance on April 1, 2011.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 712110.  The CHCC intends to award a 5.5-month bridge contract no later than March 31, 2011.  The anticipated period of performance is April 1, 2011 through September 15, 2011.  This is a sole source award.  The CHCC intends to solicit and negotiate only with the American Registry of Pathology under the authority of FAR 6.302-5.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A solicitation will not be published.  However, any quotes, proposals, or capability statements received by close of business on March 18, 2011, will be considered by the contracting officer.  The CHCC reserves the right to amend this notice if needed.  The Contracting Officer is Mr. Gary D. Hankins, (210) 221-3876, email gary.hankins@amedd.army.mil.  The Contract Specialist is Ms. Yesenia C. Rodriguez, (210) 221-5963, email yesenia.rodriguez1@amedd.army.mil.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Health Care Acquisition Activity (HCAA), Center for Health Care Contracting (CHCC), Fort Sam Houston, Texas intends to award a cost reimbursement contract on a sole source basis to the American Registry of Pathology (ARP), 14th Alaska Ave. NW, Washington, DC  20306-0001.  The requirement is for non-personal services to provide on-site scientific, professional and administrative support services for designated departments, divisions, and staff offices to transition consultative services to the Joint Pathology Center (JPC) to support the disestablishment and closure of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).  The Contractor shall provide qualified personnel, services, materials, equipment, supplies, and facilities, as necessary, to perform professional, technical, and administrative support services to designated AFIP departments, divisions, and staff offices.  The basis for sole source justification is that in carrying out the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 176, the AFIP is authorized to contract with the ARP for the services of such professional, technical, or clerical personnel as are necessary to fulfill their cooperative enterprises.  Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Law Section 2904(a)(5) states that the closure and realignment of military installations shall be completed not later than the end of the six-year period beginning 15 September 2005.  This legal mandate requires the AFIP to cease all mission support and prepare the Institute for full and complete closure not later than 15 September 2011.  Closure will require the relocation of several AFIP organizational entities located on the campus of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) to newly constructed facilities at the Forest Glen Annex, Silver Spring, MD; Dover Air Force Base, Dover, DE; Malcolm Grow Medical Center, Andrews Air Force Base, MD; and Walter Reed National Medical Center, Bethesda, MD.  Additionally, residual AFIP organizations, departments, and divisions located in Building 53 and 54 on the WRAMC campus must be fully disestablished and closed down in accordance with BRAC law.  These critical BRAC milestone events entail a high degree of uncertainty and will, at a minimum, require increased contractor support and operations to meet closure mandates.  Related laboratory and administrative supports efforts have been successfully performed by ARP for the last 15 years through a cost reimbursement, sole source contract under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5) and 10 U.S.C. 176(b)(1)(C), as implemented by FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute.  As such, ARP is the only contractor that can start full performance on 01 April 2011 and meet the immediate staff augmentation needs of the AFIP without a critical lapse of service in meeting congressionally-directed BRAC closure mandates.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 621511.  The CHCC intends to award a 5.5-month bridge contract no later than March 31, 2011.  The anticipated period of performance is April 1, 2011 through September 15, 2011.  This is a sole source award.  The CHCC intends to solicit and negotiate only with the American Registry of Pathology under the authority of FAR 6.302-5.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A solicitation will not be published.  However, any quotes, proposals, or capability statements received by close of business on March 18, 2011, will be considered by the contracting officer.  The CHCC reserves the right to amend this notice if needed.  The Contracting Officer is Mr. Gary D. Hankins, (210) 221-3876, email gary.hankins@amedd.army.mil.  The Contract Specialist is Ms. Yesenia C. Rodriguez, (210) 221-5963, email yesenia.rodriguez1@amedd.army.mil.

Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest.<BR><BR>	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated.	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day.	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>Technical Capability, and Past Performance, when combined, shall be approximately equally important to Price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability:</p>
<p>Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not.</p>
<p>Past Performance:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price:</p>
<p>Quoted price will be evaluated for reasonableness.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Simplified Acquisition Branch intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with PAJLS Electronics, Inc. using procedures in FAR Parts 6 and 13. The NWS, Observing Systems Branch has a requirement to find a solution to extend the capabilities of the iMet-1500 systems in terms of it being able to process data from the newer type of radiosondes .
<p>The NWS has international agreements with nine countries to support ten upper air stations as part of the Cooperative Hurricane Upper-Air Stations (CHUAS) network in the Caribbean basin. These observations are extremely important not only to the forecasters of the National Hurricane Center (NHC) but also to each participating Caribbean country in support of its hurricane forecasting activities and to provide data for research. All the countries currently have the iMet-1500 systems installed to support the CHUAS network upper-air activities. These systems currently can only be used with B2 radiosondes.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service has acquired many iMet 1500 and iMet 2000 systems for use through out the upper-air sounding network. Since there is a proprietary conversion process performed by the Signal Processing System (SPS) on the radiosonde data, the 10.7 Mhz converter module must be compatible with the iMet-1500 SPS. In addition to the proprietary nature of the processing, there are technical challenges in maintaining computer using 5 &frac14; floppy drives need to input the calibration coefficients for the LM Sippican B-2 radiosondes.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 334519, 500 employees small business size. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements. Responses must also be accompanied by descriptive literature, warranties, and/or other information that demonstrates that the quote meets all of the foregoing requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Amy.Sanderswhite@noaa.gov by March 21, 2011, 1:00 p.m. local time. Award will be made using FAR 13, Simplified acquisition procedures, current through FAC 2005-49. The determination to compete or not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.

The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Offerors are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all information and the Government does not assume the responsible for conducting research as a result of incorrect reference information of any kind.  The references should be provided in descending order, with the most relevant contracts appearing first.<BR><BR>               c.  Performance information will be used for both the  responsibility determination  as well as an evaluation factor.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.<BR><BR>                d.  Offerors may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate exceptional capacity to provide the service or product described in Performance Work Statement.<BR><BR>                e. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) may use past performance information obtained from other than the sources identified by the offeror.  USACE shall determine the relevance of similar past performance information.<BR><BR>4.   part 3 - Management APPROACH factor <BR><BR>a. Offerors must submit written data to support their understanding of the requirement and their proposed means of fulfilling the requirement.  Offerors should provide a complete narrative for each element listed under the Management Approach Subfactors as stated below.  NOTE:  Statements that the Offeror understands, can or will comply with all specifications, statements paraphrasing the specifications or parts thereof, or phrases such as "standard procedures will be used" or "well known techniques will be used" will be considered insufficient and could render the proposal as unacceptable.<BR><BR>b.  Subfactor 1:  Overall Organization of Personnel:<BR><BR>(1)	Demonstrate ability of overall personnel plans/structure to provide a reasonable number of personnel, with sufficient training, to provide all the tasks and services identified in the overall Performance Work Statement.  <BR><BR>(2)  Demonstrate efficient methods of communication with personnel and with Government Representatives.<BR><BR>c.

The Offeror's Price proposal must consist of the signed copy of the SF 1449 and total prices for the services requested for the Base and Option Periods included on the Continuation Page of the SF 1449.  It is expected that this contract will be awarded based upon a determination that there was adequate price competition; therefore, the offeror is not required to submit or certify cost or pricing data.  However, after receipt of proposals, if the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition does not exist in accordance with FAR 15.804-3, the offeror shall be required to provide cost or pricing data.<BR><BR> <BR>6.  5.  BASIS FOR AWARD:<BR><BR>	a.  Award will be made to the responsible Offeror whose proposal contains the combination of those criteria offering the best overall value to the U.S. Government, in accordance with FAR 15.101-1.   The Government reserves the right to consider only those proposals submitted in accordance with all instructions set forth or referenced in this solicitation.  A proposal that omits material elements required by the RFQ may be eliminated from further consideration.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is determined to be in the Government's best interests and in accordance with the criteria set forth in this solicitation.  <BR><BR>              b.  The evaluation will be based on a complete assessment of each Offeror's proposal.  The Government will evaluate proposals based on the Evaluation Factors/Criteria identified above.  It is important that Offerors possess a complete understanding of what each factor requires and accurately interprets their relative order of importance when preparing proposals in response to this solicitation.  The cumulative relative importance of the non-pricing evaluation factors are significantly more important when compared to the pricing factor.<BR>  <BR>              c. Evaluation Factors are in descending order of importance with the Technical Approach Factor being significantly more important than the  Past Performance Factor , which is more important than the Management Approach Factor.  Subfactors listed under major factors are of equal importance within their respective major factor.<BR><BR>d.  At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions.   IAW with FAR 15.101-1(2), the evaluation factors other than  price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. <BR><BR>    	e.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR>(End of clause)<BR><BR><BR><BR>Wage Determination for Schofield Barracks, HI (See Attachment)<BR>Wage Determination for Fort Belvoir, VA (See Attachment)<BR>Wage Determination for Fort Bragg, NC (See Attachment)<BR>Contract Manpower Reporting Clause (See Attachment)<BR><BR>Clauses may be accessed electronically in full text through http://farsite.hill.af.mil or www.acquisition.gov/far.

<DESC>The Air Force is seeking sources for a potential 100 percent set-aside for HUBZone or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns. IF ADEQUATE RESPONSES ARE NOT RECEIVED, THE ACQUISTION MAY BE SOLICITED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS. <strong>This is a sources sought notice for planning purposes only.</strong>
<p>This requirement is for the renovation of INVENT Building 20019 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. This project renovates an existing 240' x 60' steel structure, masonry infill building constructed in 1927, into a modern test facility for propulsion research. Included in this project are interior demolitions of existing concrete equipment support and first floor slab areas, new interior structural members, exterior brick, masonry and window refurbishment, new HVAC system, new electrical and communication systems, new mezzanine for data collection offices , and new sprinkler/fire alarm mass notification systems. Also included in this project is a continuation of the research air piping system supported on exterior pier structures into the building test stand platforms.</p>
<p><strong>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS:</strong> Building 20019 has been identified as a candidate for listing on the United States National Register of Historic Places. Preservation of the exterior is of high concern. Because of the deteriorated condition of the brick, masonry, and steel framed windows due to age, the contractor needs specialty experience in the repair and refurbishment of these items. Experience working with Historic Preservation Guidelines and the State of Ohio Preservation Office is suggested.</p>
<p>With a building of this vintage, and the scope of renovation, experience is also suggested with environmental hazards remediation including lead based paint, asbestos containing material, etc. The research air system is a specialized application. The contractor should have experience in ASME B31.3 process piping code and appropriate welding certifications. This project includes furniture, and has four separate funding sources and should be bid accordingly. Refer to the bid schedule for more detail. The facility is currently unoccupied and will remain that way until construction is complete.</p>
<p>There will be furniture involved in this project. However, most of the furniture deals with ten workstations which are to be tied into the building systems (i.e., electrical, communication, data, etc.).</p>
<p>In addition, contractors must have:<br />&bull; Experience with renovation of historic buildings.<br />&bull; Experience with environmental hazard (asbestos and lead paint) remediation <br />&bull; Experience in process piping (ASME B31.3).</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 420 calendar day period of performance. The estimated magnitude of the entire contract is over $10,000,000.00</p>
<p>Prime contractors who are HUBZone or SDVOSB and who intend to submit a bid for this solicitation MUST submit the following by 4:00 p.m. (local Dayton time) on Friday, 18 March 2011.<br /><br />Responses should include the following: <br />(1) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this solicitation as a Prime Contractor; <br />(2) date of HUBZone certification; and <br />(3) Documentation of SDVOSB status; and<br />(4) listing of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact with their phone numbers, and an explanation of the relevancy of the project; <br />(5) Documentation from surety or their agent of your capability to be bonded for bid, performance and payment bonds for this project;<br />(6) If you are a HUBZone considering a joint venture that has not been formalized, you will need to specify the firm(s) you intend to partner with and how you plan to officially form the joint venture.</p>
<p>Firms interested should provide the above documentation, fax or e-mail responses will be accepted. All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on the availability of interested HUBZone or SDVOSB concerns. Responses shall be limited to 5 pages. Please include your DUNS Number and CAGE Code on your response.</p>
<p>Failure to submit all information requested would result in a contractor being considered "non-responsive" in this requirement. A decision on whether this will be pursued as a set-aside or an unrestricted basis will be posted as a modification in Federal Business Opportunities.</p>

No response to this posting is required.  <BR><BR>The United States Army Contracting Command anticipates purchasing approximately 370 Standard Ground Stations, with potentially up to 537 units based upon additional requirements and funding approval.<BR><BR>The Army is requesting feedback from contractors to determine the status of currently available commercial, Non- Developmental Items/products, technologies, and manufacturing sources of supply capable of producing and integrating the SGS capability for the current and future fleet of the BETSS-C FoS. The BETSS-C integrated FoS is comprised of existing mobile and semi-fixed sensors providing targeting and persistent surveillance, force protection, and counter Improvised Explosive Devices and counter insurgent capabilities for 360 degree, day and night coverage.  BETSS-C sensor systems combine to meet the aggregated requirements of operational needs for US forces in the field.  SGS is the ground station subsystem that provides the primary sensor interface and common tactical picture for the BETSS-C FoS.  For purposes of this RFI, the SGS capability includes the SGS laptop and ground station subsystem and the following modules:  Rapid Aerostat Initial Deployment (RAID) communications (integrates with the RAID platform to normalize input/output for video, control and status information to the SGS); Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS); Cerberus Sensor Interface (integrates with a Cerberus platform and transmits control, status and video information to the SGS); and initial provisioning spares.  Additionally, the army is interested in commercial solutions that are supported by industry's ability to commence high rate monthly production of 64 systems per month within 60 days of contract award, and a test system within 45 days from contract award.  This will eventually lead to the delivery and integration of 300 or more SGS systems.<BR><BR>The SGS version 2.2.2 Level II Technical Data Package (TDP) is comprised of drawings, interface control documents and system specifications.  The TDP provided should be considered in final draft stage.  The government reserves the right to make any changes deemed necessary for the final TDP released with the forthcoming RFP.  Version 2.2.2 is the version that the SGS production and integration effort will be based upon. It is the Government's belief that the 2.2.2 design will give interested Sources sufficient detail to understand the requirements, provide feedback, and prepare for the RFP.  All subsystems contained in 2.2.2 are Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) products.  Salient characteristics, product description and performance parameters are set forth below.<BR><BR>SGS Capability: video ingest capability providing inputs for analog video outputs; video distribution amplifier capability for analog video distribution providing inputs and outputs used to boost signal strength and prevent signal loss and picture degradation when split and disseminated, enabling input video to be routed to multiple outputs; analog/digital video matrix capability that combines multiple, independent matrix switchers in a modular and configurable frame for display; NTSC Composite Video Board providing NTSC composite inputs and outputs to route composite video signals; HDCP Compliant DVI Matrix Switcher Board providing DVI inputs and outputs to route HDCP interface video signals and switch HDMI compatible signals; Serial/IP server used for converting between serial and IP, providing RJ45 serial ports that can be configured independently for RS-232, RS-422, and RS-485 signals; video processing/visualization providing computer processing to perform both video processing and visualization; integrated switch and router used for routing between devices on the local-area network and wide-area network or external side as well as  providing network address translation between those respective virtual LANs; displays capable of providing high resolution, composite analog handling of underscan video components, composite analog and DVI / HDMI; two (2) rack mountable computers, 1-U height, dual HexaCore processors for controlling sensors, processing information, and archiving video data; miscellaneous standards, commercially available computer, video and networking cables of various lengths; and, all components integrated into a hardened, weatherproof rack-mount transit case.<BR><BR>RAID Communications Module:  Fiber modem that decodes the analog video and serial metadata from the sensor platform; serial/IP server used for converting between serial and IP, providing RJ45 serial ports that can be configured independently for RS-232, RS-422, and RS-485 signals; 4 port Network switch; Fiber Ethernet switch; custom rotary switch for override mode; MIL-DTL 38999 connector interface for the FLIR Star Safire III Laptop Control Unit; a fabricated housing for above electronic components; a mechanical housing for wireless radio power over Ethernet injector components; miscellaneous standard, commercially available computer, video and networking cables of various lengths; and, all components integrated into a hardened, weatherproof rack-mount transit case.<BR><BR>Uninterruptable Power Supply Module:  Battery powered and all components integrated into a hardened, weatherproof rack-mount transit case, that supports 30 minutes of uninterrupted operation when primary power source is lost. <BR><BR>Cerberus Sensor Interface Module:  Common Criteria Certified network router; video server capable of ingesting, processing and disseminating analog input to H.264 format; serial to IP conversion capable of interface via asynchronous serial communications with imagers as well as with other sensors and devices; relay controls providing an electrical relay switch that can be set to turn on, turn off, or pulse a number of devices - allowing power cycling and resets of certain components; unattended ground sensor receiver capable of receiving radio link transmission from several types of sensors (i.e., seismic or acoustic); power over Ethernet injector capable of supplying power over Cat 5/6/7; DC-DC converter required for converting voltages as necessary for different power supply requirements; thermal management provided by an active cooling system required to maintain proper operation; custom circuit boards for power distribution, relay interference, voltage and temperature monitoring; custom control cables using MIL-DTL-38999 and MIL-C-5015 connectors to connect with several sensors on the Cerberus trailer mast; and a rugged fabricated rack mount enclosure designed to protect the components from the environment, shock, and vibration on the Cerberus trailer.<BR><BR>SGS laptop/control station:  environmentally hardened laptop computer integrated into a hardened, weatherproof MIL-STD-810F transit case.<BR><BR>Interested sources are requested to review the TDP and provide any feedback such that the Government can prepare the final RFP.

<DESC>(Q1) Reference Q&A 36 and others related to CECOM's plans for NexGen SB awards/partial SB set-asides.  Will SB primes awarded NexGen IDIQ contracts be permitted to submit proposals for unrestricted task orders?  If the answer to this question is yes, will the SBs have to meet the requirements of FAR 52.219-14 on such tasks?<BR><BR> (A1)  Only primes awarded under the non-set-aside portion will be permitted to submit proposals for non-set-aside task orders.  Only Small Business primes awarded under the set-aside portion will be permitted to submit proposals under the set-aside portion. <BR><BR>(Q2) Reference the multiple questions addressing restrictions on teaming arrangements (Q&A 3, Q&A 34, Q&A 73, and Q&A 75).  The answers to Questions 3, 34, 73, and 75 all indicate that offerors can propose both as prime and as subs but that any offeror who is awarded a prime contract will not be eligible to participate as a subcontractor.  We respectfully suggest that the Government reconsider its position on this matter.   Such a restriction may run counter to the Government's best interest for a number of reasons.  For example, it limits the ability of small businesses to participate in the NexGen procurement because a SB prime would not be eligible to provide support to a LB prime on unrestricted requirements that it might otherwise be ineligible or incapable of bidding as a prime.  In addition, this restriction will almost certainly greatly complicate the evaluation.  For example, if Company A submits a proposal with Company B as a subcontractor and cites Company B's experience or past performance, and Company B also submits a winning proposal as a prime contractor, how will the Government take into account in the evaluation the fact that Company B is no longer eligible to serve as Company A's subcontractor without first providing Company A and opportunity to "backfill" the now irrelevant experience or past performance?<BR><BR>(A2) Prime Contractors are allowed to be subcontractor under other primes.  The vendors may be a subcontractor under multiple primes.<BR>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY. WE ARE NOT SOLICITING PRODUCTS AT THIS TIME.<BR><BR>The Army LNA is the baseline enterprise NetOps reference architecture for the Army's LandWarNet. As an integrated architecture, the LNA provides an enterprise level Army statement of NetOps requirements through the Operational, Systems, and Technical views. These views together depict a holistic approach to NetOps with functional capabilities designed to support NetOps products, software, tools or systems, evaluation/selection.<BR><BR>Achieving NetOps systems interoperability and integration across the Army Enterprise Infostructure is challenging due to the extraordinarily large and diverse organizations and existing stove-pipe tools and systems. Standardizing a scalable NetOps toolset is an Army priority.<BR><BR>An optimal way to achieve standardization and increase NetOps systems interoperability and integration is to address the acquisition process. As a result, it is the intent of the Army to enforce Compliance of the Army's LNA Capabilities into the NetOps systems selection and acquisition process to enhance and ensure interoperability and integration across the Army Enterprise.<BR><BR>Army Regulation (AR) 25-1 mandates the assessment of NetOps products against the architecture to ensure they meet functional and interoperability requirements within the Army Enterprise. As a part of the Certificate of Networthiness - CoN approval process, all NetOps products - software, tools or systems must be compliant to the LNA.<BR><BR>NETCOM/9th Signal Command has responsibility to ensure all NetOps products are compliant to the LNA, prior to issuing a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN to acquire, field or connect to the Army's Enterprise. NetOps software, tools, and systems are those products - COTS/GOTS utilized on or for the LandWarNet, which monitor and manage the networked devices within the Army Enterprise Infostructure. These NetOps products securely manage, operate and maintain the network; they are not the network devices or elements themselves. NetOps software, tools, and systems are those products - COTS/GOTS which monitor and manage the networked devices within the Army Enterprise Infostructure. <BR><BR>LNA Compliance generally refers to the measurement of a NetOps product in meeting the Army LNA Key Performance Parameters - KPPs and interoperability requirements and standards. The heart of the LNA Compliance process is the initial product assessment mapping to the LNA Capabilities, validation of the products functional capabilities and data flow interaction with other LNA Capabilities within the LNA.<BR>NETCOM/9th Signal Command has developed LNA Compliance Checklists for each of the Army's current LNA Capabilities. Posting of these documents on the FedBizOpps is to provide the criteria required for NetOps products to be compliant to the LNA. These Checklists are available to Industry, providing vendors the ability to review and perform assessments of their NetOps products against the LNA requirements. Vendors desiring to access these LNA documents should MAP their NetOps product to the appropriate LNA Capability(s) identified in the NETCOM/9TH Signal Command LNA Bin Chart.  To access the LNA Bin Chart scroll down to 'Additional Info' located near the bottom of this Synopsis page then place cursor and click mouse on URL text "LNA Compliance Checklists/Documents".                                                                                                                       <BR>(Hyperlink to LNA BIN Chart is:  http://www.netcom.army.mil/LNA_Webpage/LNABIN.htm) <BR><BR>Compliance Checklists exist for each of the current LNA Capabilities and are linked via their respective capability block on the LNA Bin Chart identified above. To view LNA material related to any particular LNA Capability, click the text in the respective capability block of the LNA Bin Chart. This links to a Word Document which provides an overview or description of the specific LNA Capability, a graphical representation of the capabilities interface requirements with other LNA capabilities to include data exchanges, and further provides a link to the detailed LNA Compliance Checklists outlining functional and Interoperability requirements.<BR><BR>In order for NetOps products, for use on the Army LandWarNet - LWN, to be considered for selection, Army requiring activities must obtain a Certificate of Networthiness from NETCOM/9th Signal Command, as stated in AR 25-1. See chapters 2-2, 2-15 thru 2-27, and 6-3. As a part of the CoN approval process, all NetOps products software, tools, or systems must be Compliant to the LNA. <BR><BR>Industry is encouraged to utilize these LNA Checklists to perform a self-assessment of their NetOps products to ensure their products compliance with the Army's LNA Compliance requirements. <BR><BR>It is recommended Army requiring activities utilize these checklists, as part of their market research, evaluation and acquisition process, for new or enhanced NetOps products, to ensure the products compliance to the LNA prior to seeking a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN from NETCOM/9th Signal Command.<BR><BR>When reviewing or preparing to acquire COTS NetOps products, for use on the Army LandWarNet, Army Requiring Activities should obtain a completed LNA Compliance Checklist, from the vendor, for the LNA capability to which the NetOps product maps. The completed checklist is the vendor's assessment of their products compliance to the LNA and will be viewed as the vendor's certification of their NetOps products compliance to the Army LNA functional and interoperability requirements.<BR><BR>Army requiring activities should e-mail completed LNA Compliance Checklist and supporting documentation to the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team at compliance.team@conus.army.mil. Vendors should not directly submit their completed checklists to the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team.<BR><BR>These LNA Checklists and supporting documentation will be utilized by the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team in their assessment of the NetOps products compliance to the Army LNA, prior to a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN being granted by NETCOM/9th Signal Command.<BR><BR>Prospective procurement of such products will be advertised and procured by Army Agencies requiring products. <BR><BR><BR>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY. WE ARE NOT SOLICITING PRODUCTS AT THIS TIME.<BR>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs
Office of Acquisition and Logistics
      Technology Acquisition Center
      260 Industrial Way West
      Eatontown, NJ 07724
         
2.	Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a one (1) year, firm-fixed-price contract for support services for the continued deployment of the Content Distribution Network (CDN).

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  The purpose of this proposed action is to provide support services for the continued deployment of the CDN.  CDN is an enterprise system that delivers Veterans Affairs Knowledge Network (VAKN) broadcasts and Content on Demand (COD) videos to employee desktops across the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) via internet protocol (IP).  The Contractor shall provide support services that fall into three (3) categories: Primary Network Support, Web Application Maintenance and Web Application Project Management.  Primary Network Support entails the services required to maintain the CDN, provide technical support to CDN users and local information technology (IT) staff, implement major infrastructure upgrades, implement one-time 2011 CDN goals and provide support during equipment installations across the VA as the enterprise-wide rollout continues.  Web Application Maintenance entails services necessary for one (1) year of hardware and software maintenance for the VA's CDN web application.  This includes all tasks necessary to maintain the CDN application at its current level of operation and to host the supporting hardware components at the CDN Server Farm at the Network and Security Operations Center (NSOC) Hines Data Center.  Finally, the contractor shall provide Web Application Project Management.  The contractor shall coordinate all web application support, maintenance and development activities.  The contractor shall also serve as a liaison between the contractors CDN Web Development Team, the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), and Government CDN Leadership Team.  The total estimated price of the proposed action is $2,948,893.92.    

4.	Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 38 U.S.C. 8127(c), Veterans First Contracting Program.  Contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by written justifications as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-5, "Authorized or required by statute".

5.	Reason for Authority Cited:  The proposed source for this action is Superior Communication Solutions, Inc. (SCSI), 3301 7th Street, S.E., Moultrie, GA 31788, a certified service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB).  SCSI provided a capabilities statement on December 26, 2010 demonstrating that it has the knowledge, expertise, and skill sets to perform the required tasks in this highly specialized and complex environment.  In fact, SCSI has performed similar work, on Government contracts for the past seven (7) years, thereby exemplifying its capability to provide the type of support services required for continued deployment of the CDN.  Furthermore, SCSI has partnered with two (2) contractors who are performing as subcontractors on the current CDN contract.  Although SCSI has confirmed that it will be performing at least 51% of the work required by this effort, it intends to utilize these experienced partners, as subcontractors, should it receive the award.  In light of the above, the Government's technical experts have determined that SCSI is capable of meeting all of the Government's requirements and is considered a responsible SDVOSB.       

6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted and the details are contained in the market research section below.  

7.	Actions to Increase Competition:  Consistent with the guidelines of the Veterans First Contracting Program, the proposed action described herein will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities Page in accordance with FAR Part 5.  In the future the Government will continue to utilize a Request for Information (RFI) in order to identify additional SDVOSBs capable of performing this work in an effort to maximize competition.

8.	Market Research: Market research was conducted by searching the VetBiz.gov database on December 29, 2010 to determine that SCSI is a SDVOSB.  This search concluded that SCSI is registered and certified in the VetBiz.gov database and qualifies as a SDVOSB in accordance with federal small business size standards for the applicable North American Industry Classification System code 541512.  Additionally, a search in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) performed on December 29, 2010 showed that SCSI is registered under CCR.  Based on this market research and an assessment of their capabilities, the Government's technical experts have determined that SCSI is a SDVOSB and can meet the Government's requirements.

9.	Other Facts: The Procuring Contracting Officer has determined that this proposed action meets all the requirements of the statute 38 U.S.C 8127(c).  This procurement is below the $5,000,000 statutory threshold, SCSI is a responsible SDVOSB, and in the estimation of the Contracting Officer, the contract award will be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the Government.

10.	Technical and Requirements Certification:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Approval



As the Contracting Activity Competition Advocate and based on the foregoing justification, I hereby approve a one (1) year, firm-fixed-price, contract for support services for the continued deployment of the Content Distribution Network, on an other than full and open competition basis pursuant to the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8127(c), subject to availability of funds, and provided that the services herein described have otherwise been authorized for acquisition.
