The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />Factor A -- APPROACH AND CAPABILITIES - Offerors will be evaluated based on their corporate and individual qualifications to perform the work; adequacy of equipment, materials and facilities proposed; and experience with the types of services identified in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Factor B -- PAST PERFORMANCE -- Performance by the quoter and its subcontractor(s) as it relates to all solicitation requirements will be evaluated. The evaluation will include the quality of supplies and services previously performed, timeliness of performance, customer satisfaction and indication of ability to improve performance through proactive management. Evaluation of this factor will be based on the information contained in the proposal and information provided by references.

Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br /><br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p>The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.</p>
<p>1352.209-73 COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APR)</p>
<p>The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />1352.209-74 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:<br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and<br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.<br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.<br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver. <br />1330-52.203-70 Scientific Integrity and Research Misconduct<br />As prescribed in 1330-3.70, please insert the following provision:<br />Scientific and Research Misconduct</p>

<p>Scientific integrity means the condition resulting from adherence to professional values and practices when conducting and applying the results of science that ensures objectivity, clarity, and reproducibility, and that provides insulation from bias, fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, interference, censorship, and inadequate procedural and information security.</p>
<p>Presentation of scientific activities results includes the analysis, synthesis, compilation, or translation of scientific information and data into formats for the use of the Department of Commerce or the United States of America.</p>
<p>Scientific and Research Misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing scientific and research activities, or in the products or reporting of the results of these activities. It specifically includes intentional circumvention of the integrity of the scientific and research process and actions that compromise that process, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion.</p>
<p>Investigation is formal collection and evaluation of information and facts to determine if scientific or research misconduct can be established, to assess its extent and consequences, and to recommend appropriate action.</p>
<p>(b) General Guidelines<br />1. Maintaining Integrity. The Contractor shall maintain the scientific integrity of research performed pursuant to this contract award including the prevention, detection, and remediation of research misconduct, and the conduct of inquiries, investigations and adjudications of allegations of research misconduct.<br />2.

By executing this contract, the Contractor provides its assurance that it has established an administrative process for performing an inquiry, investigating, and reporting allegations of scientific and research misconduct; and that it will comply with its own administrative process for performing an inquiry, investigation and reporting of such misconduct.<br />5. The Contractor shall insert the substance of this provision in subcontracts at all tiers that involve research being performed under this contract.</p>
<p>(c) Investigating Misconduct Research<br />1. Initiating Investigation. If the Contractor determines that there is sufficient evidence to proceed to an investigation, it shall notify the contracting officer and, unless otherwise instructed, the Contractor shall:<br />a. Promptly conduct an investigation to develop a complete factual record and an examination of such record leading to either a finding of scientific and research misconduct and an identification of appropriate remedies or a determination that no further action is warranted.<br />b. If the investigation leads to a finding of scientific and research misconduct, obtain adjudication by a neutral third party adjudicator. The adjudication must include a review of the investigative record and, as warranted, a determination of appropriate corrective actions and sanctions.<br />2. Finalizing Investigation. When the investigation is complete, the Contractor shall forward to the contracting officer a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report, any recommendations made to the Contractor's adjudicating official, the adjudicating official's decision and notification of any corrective action taken or planned, and the subject's written response (if any).<br /><br />(d) Findings and Corrective Actions<br />1. If the Contractor finds that scientific and research misconduct has occurred, it shall assess the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact on the research completed or in process and shall:<br />a. Take all necessary corrective actions, which includes, but are not limited to, correcting the research record, and, as appropriate, imposing restrictions, controls, or other parameters on research in process or to be conducted in the future, and<br />b. Coordinate remedial action with the contracting officer.<br />(e) Department of Commerce Actions<br />1.

Such remedies and actions may include, but are not limited to, disallowance of costs, recoupment of contract payments, and suspension or debarment.<br />52.203-99 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTING WITH ENTITIES THAT REQUIRE CERTAIN INTERNAL CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS (FEB 2015) <br />(a) The Contractor shall not require employees or subcontractors seeking to report<br />fraud, waste, or abuse to sign or comply with internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information.<br />(b) The contractor shall notify employees that the prohibitions and restrictions of any <br />internal confidentiality agreements covered by this clause are no longer in effect.<br />(c) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this clause does not contravene requirements <br />applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information.</p>
<p>(d)(1) In accordance with section 743 of Division E, Title VII, of the Consolidated and <br />Further Continuing Resolution Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) <br />(1) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <br />(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br />(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />52.232-40 PROVIDING ACCELERATED PAYMENTS TO SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTORS (DEC 2013)</p>

FAR - SUBPART 42.15 - CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE INFORMATION 

LOC - SUBPART 42.15 - CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE INFORMATION (DIAPR) 2010-14, Amendment 1 
CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTING SYSTEM (JULY 2010)

(a) FAR 42.1502 directs all Federal agencies to collect past performance information on contracts. The Department of the Interior (DOI) has implemented the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to comply with this regulation. One or more past performance evaluations will be conducted in order to record your contract performance as required by FAR 42.15. 

(b) The past performance evaluation process is a totally paperless process using CPARS. CPARS is a web-based system that allows for electronic processing of the performance evaluation report. Once the report is processed, it is available in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for Government use in evaluating past performance as part of a source selection action.

(c) We request that you furnish the Contracting Officer with the name, position title, phone number, and email address for each person designated to have access to your firm's past performance evaluation(s) for the contract no later than 30 days after award. Each person granted access will have the ability to provide comments in the Contractor portion of the report and state whether or not the Contractor agrees with the evaluation, before returning the report to the Assessing Official. The report information must be protected as source selection sensitive information not releasable to the public.

(d) When your Contractor Representative(s) (Past Performance Points of Contact) are registered in CPARS, they will receive an automatically-generated email with detailed login instructions. Further details, systems requirements, and training information for CPARS is available at http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/. The CPARS User Manual, registration for On Line Training for Contractor Representatives, and a practice application may be found at this site.

(e) Within 60 days after the end of a performance period, the Contracting Officer will complete an interim or final past performance evaluation, and the report will be accessible at http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/. Contractor Representatives may then provide comments in response to the evaluation, or return the evaluation without comment. Comments are limited to the space provided in Block 22. Your comments should focus on objective facts in the Assessing Official's narrative and should provide your views on the causes and ramifications of the assessed performance. In addition to the ratings and supporting narratives, blocks 1 - 17 should be reviewed for accuracy, as these include key fields that will be used by the Government to identify your firm in future source selection actions. If you elect not to provide comments, please acknowledge receipt of the evaluation by indicating "No comment" in Block 22, and then signing and dating Block 23 of the form. Without a statement in Block 22, you will be unable to sign and submit the evaluation back to the Government. If you do not sign and submit the CPAR within 30 days, it will automatically be returned to the Government and will be annotated: "The report was delivered/received by the contractor on (date). The contractor neither signed nor offered comment in response to this assessment." Your response is due within 30 calendar days after receipt of the CPAR.

(f) The following guidelines apply concerning your use of the past performance evaluation:

(1) Protect the evaluation as "source selection information." After review, transmit the evaluation by completing and submitting the form through CPARS. If for some reason you are unable to view and/or submit the form through CPARS, contact the Contracting Officer for instructions. 

(2) Strictly control access to the evaluation within your organization. Ensure the evaluation is never released to persons or entities outside of your control.

(3) Prohibit the use of or reference to evaluation data for advertising, promotional material, preaward surveys, responsibility determinations, production readiness reviews, or other similar purposes.

(g) If you wish to discuss a past performance evaluation, you should request a meeting in writing to the Contracting Officer no later than seven days following your receipt of the evaluation. The meeting will be held in person or via telephone or other means during your 30-day review period.

(h) A copy of the completed past performance evaluation will be available in CPARS for your viewing and for Government use supporting source selection actions after it has been finalized.

If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.

	l. Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. 

	The options are:
	(1) Vendor must accept the system without the drive;
	(2) VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original 	drive at time of turn-in; or
	(3) VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of 	purchase. 
	(4) Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;

	(a) The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; 

	(b) Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be preapproved and described in the purchase order or contract.

	(c) A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed.
	The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.

	4. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

	a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

	b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.

	c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.

	d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover.

	5. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH

	a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. However, it is the policy of VA to forgo collection of liquidated damages in the event the contractor provides payment of actual damages in an amount determined to be adequate by the agency.
		
	b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. 
	Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be 	deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.

	c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:

	(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
	(2) Description of the event, including:
	(a) Date of occurrence;
	(b) Data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
	(3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
	(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
	(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
	(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control; 
	(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons); VA information, obtain monetary or other
	(8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
	(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
	(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and
	Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
	(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.
	d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
	(1) Notification;
	(2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
	(3) Data breach analysis;
	(4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
	(5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
	(6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.
	6. CONFIDENTIALITY AND NONDISCLOSURE
	      It is agreed that:
	a. The preliminary and final deliverables and all associated working papers, application source code, and other material deemed relevant by the VA which has been generated by the contractor in the performance of this task order are the exclusive property of the U.S. Government and shall be submitted to the CO at the conclusion of the task order.
	b. The CO will be the sole authorized official to release verbally or in writing, any data, the draft deliverables, the final deliverables, or any other written or printed materials pertaining to this task order.  No information shall be released by the contractor.  Any request for information relating to this task order presented to the contractor shall be submitted to the CO for response.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Medical Q-Coded Services (MQS) Industry Day</strong></span></p>
<p>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Contracting Operations Division - San Antonio (COD - SA), is conducting an Industry Day to promote an early exchange of information in a market research effort in anticipation of awarding a common sourcing platform that will provide medical services under Product Service Code (PSC) Q for the Military Health System (MHS).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span>:</strong> DHA and the Military Department (MILDEP) Surgeon General's operate Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) world-wide that make up the direct care delivery system. The complement of MTFs include clinics (stand alone, non-bedded facilities), community hospitals, and medical centers with teaching responsibilities, which are staffed by Department of Defense (DoD) military personnel, civilian employees and contract staff. The contract staff is comprised of numerous medically-related occupations. These include health care workers in the following broad functional categories supporting inpatient and outpatient facilities:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;Physician Services (includes primary and specialty care physicians) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;Nursing Services (includes Licensed Practical / Vocational Nurses, Registered Nurses, Advance Practice Nurses and other Specialty Nurses)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;Ancillary Services (includes clinical positions other than nursing, physicians, or dental)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;Dental Services (includes dentists, dental specialists, hygienists, assistants and technicians)</p>
<p>The acquisition that will make up the DHA common sourcing platform will consist of functionally segmented (e.g., Physician, Nurse, Ancillary, and Dental), multiple award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Firm Fixed Priced (FFP), Commercial contracts using both personal and non-personal service arrangements. The contracts will have a 5-year ordering period, with no option periods at the contract level (options may be applied at the Task Order level). The acquisition will be a total small business set-aside. The DHA common sourcing platform will be designed to allow MTFs within each of the MILDEPS (Army, Air Force, and Navy) and DHA to acquire medical and dental staffing services to augment the existing military and civilian staffs in a standard, cost effective, and efficient manner. <br /><br />It is not mandatory that you attend Industry Day.
