V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:  (a) Ability to Meet Program Milestones and Proposed Schedule - The white paper/proposal establishes a clear and reasonable schedule with well-defined research milestones to be used as exit and entry criteria for government approval to progress through phases of the proposed effort.  The feasibility and likelihood of the proposed approach for satisfying the program milestones are explicitly described and clearly substantiated.  The white paper/proposal reflects a mature and quantitative understanding of the proposed milestones, the statistical confidence with which they may be measured, and their relationship to the concept of operations that will result from successful performance.  NOTE:  This criterion will not be used to evaluate single phase/short duration (12 months or less) efforts, unless the Government requests research milestones be provided in the request for proposal; (b) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The proposed technical approach is feasible, achievable and.  Task descriptions and associated technical elements provided are complete and in a logical sequence with all proposed deliverables clearly defined such that a final product that achieves the goal can be expected as a result of award.  The white paper/proposal identifies major technical risks and planned mitigation efforts are clearly defined and feasible; (c) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the AFRL Mission - The potential contributions of the proposed effort with relevance to the national technology base will be evaluated.  Specifically, AFRL’s mission is to maintain the technological superiority of the U.S. Air Force and prevent technological surprise from harming our national security by sponsoring revolutionary, high-payoff research that bridges the gap between fundamental discoveries and their military use; (d) Offeror’s Capabilities and/or Related Experience - The offeror's prior experience in similar efforts must clearly demonstrate an ability to deliver products that meet the proposed technical performance within the proposed budget and schedule.  The proposed team’s expertise to manage the cost and schedule will be evaluated.  Similar efforts completed/ongoing by the offeror in this area are fully described including identification of other Government sponsors; (e) Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition - The capability to transition the technology to the research, industrial, and operational military communities in such a way as to enhance U.S. defense, and the extent to which intellectual property rights limitations creates or may create a barrier to technology transition; and (f) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  

No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. 

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.  

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service contracting and General Services Office in Portland, Oregon has a requirement for a contractor to mechanically and chemically treat weeds to prevent the spread of wildfires and increase wildlife habitat quality.  The project area consists of three treatment units in the Sweetwater River channel between Willow Glen Drive and the Sweetwater Reservoir in Rancho San Diego, California (Maps 1-4). The majority of the project area (Treatment Units 1 and 2; Maps 2 and 3) consists of Southern Cottonwood-Willow Riparian Forest dominated by Gooding's willow {Salix goodingii), arroyo willow (Salix lasiolepis), California sycamore {Platanus racemosa), Fremont cottonwood {Populus fremontii ssp. fremontii), and mulefat {Baccharis salicifolici). Upland areas adjacent to the project area are classified as Diegan coastal sage scrub and southern mixed chaparral. A wide variety of non-native, invasive woody species can be found throughout the project area. The primary non-native species to be targeted for removal include giant reed {Arundo donax), salt-cedar (Tamarix spp.), Peruvian peppertree {Schinus molle), eucalyptus {Eucalyptus spp.), Mexican fan palm {Washingtonia robusta), Canary Island date palm {Phoenix canariensis), and castor bean {Ricinus commiinis) (Table 1). These species, especially giant reed, tamarisk, and the palms, are known to significantly increase fire hazard in the wildland-urban interface. Treatment Unit 3 consists of privately-owned land occupied by the Cottonwood Golf Course. Two concentrations of invasive plants on the golf course will be targeted (Map 4). The first extends westward from the end of Par Four Drive along the edge of the refuge, and the second is located around a pond just east of the Steele Canyon Road Bridge. The total area of the three treatment units is 278 acres (Unit 1: 124; Unit 2: 118; Unit 3: 36). However, the target plants are scattered throughout the units, and the actual area to be treated is approximately 20 acres. Patches of giant reed are typically small (less than 0.02 acres) and are scattered throughout the project area.  Prior to the start of the project, contractor will develop a map of invasive woody species with the project area using a GPS unit.  This will be a base with 4 option years, with period of performance starting the beginning of July, 2008.
Award of this contract will be based on best overall value you to the government with past performance and cost as factors.
Solicitation no. 801818Q243 to include all attachments shall be made available by the beginning of June 2008 and will be available electronically through a link to the National Business Center (NBC) Interior Electronic Acquisition System-Electronic Commerce at www.fedbizopps.gov or www.nbc.gov .  For assistance in downloading information from NBC, please contact their helpdesk at (703) 390-6707.
Interested contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration www.ccr.gov (CCR) and complete Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) www.bpn.gov.  
This will be a set aside for small businesses residing in the State of California only.

The Policy Simulation Group has developed proprietary software which allows analysts to perform both macroeconomic and distributional analyses of Social Security policy changes.  The SSASIM and GEMINI software is a proven economical and technical solution for SSA’s policy research and analysis, which makes the continued use of SSASIM and GEMINI the most efficient and effective technical and cost solution at this time.    This procurement will be accomplished in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5 as applicable.  This acquisition will be processed under the simplified acquisition procedures. The NAICS code for this procurement is 511210, and the small business size standard is $23 Million. 

This requirement will include software licenses and the continued maintenance, technical support and training of SSASIM and GEMINI Software.  The contract will have one base year and four option years beginning August 10, 2008.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct any future competitive procurement.  Any vendor capable of performing the preceding requirements must present electronic/written evidence of such capability by close of business June 6, 2008. The evidence must include a discussion of how the software would satisfy the proposed requirements, contact information for no more than three (3) customer references, and associated GSA Schedule or commercial price information on the software and support. The Government does not intend to pay for information received and does not intend to provide evaluation results to the sender.  All responses must be sent to traci.leach@ssa.gov by Friday June 6, 2008, 5:00 p.m. EST.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this &ldquo;sources sought&rdquo; is to identify hotels willing to provide meeting space, lodging, and meals in the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area, in light of new guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Justice Programs. Two of the new requirements prescribe limits for meals and refreshments served at breaks. Regarding meals, the new guideline states that the cost of any meal provided, plus any hotel service costs, cannot exceed 150 percent of the locality M&amp;IE per meal. For example, if breakfast is provided, in a locality with a $64.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the breakfast rate in the locality is $12.00 per breakfast. Therefore, the cost of the breakfast provided at the conference cannot exceed $18.00 ($12.00 X 150%) per person. If lunch will be provided in a locality with a $64.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the lunch rate in the locality is $18.00 per lunch. Therefore, the cost of the lunch provided at the conference cannot exceed $27.00 ($18.00 X 150%) per person. The new guideline defines refreshments as light food and drinks served at breaks and include such items as coffee, tea, milk, juice, soft drinks, donuts, bagels, fruit, pretzels, cookies, chips, or muffins. Under the new guidelines the cost of these items, plus any hotel service costs, cannot exceed 23 percent of the locality (M&amp;IE) for both morning and afternoon breaks. For the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan area, the M&amp;IE rate is $64.00 per person. Therefore, the cost of the refreshments cannot exceed $14.72 ($64.00 X 23%) per person per day. Any hotel source interested and capable of providing lodging at the Federal per diem rates and meeting the new guideline requirements should submit a statement of capabilities, to include sleeping and meeting capacity, floor charts, and food and beverage menus, to the point of contact identified. The food and beverage menus should support the pricing mentioned above, including hotel service costs: breakfast, $12.00 per person; lunch, $18.00 per person; and refreshments for both morning and afternoon breaks, $14.72 per person. Interested hotels should respond by 3:00 p.m., Thursday, May 29, 2008</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Robert M Nolin, Contracting Officer, Phone 937-255-6291, Email robert.nolin@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC><p>This is a combined Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information (RFI). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI.
<p>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only. In accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation the Government is conducting Market Research. This Market Research is for information and planning purposes only. Before submitting any information to the Government, be advised that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of these questions or to otherwise pay for the information you provide. Your responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal. This information will be used to assist in developing the acquisition strategy. Any information provided by the Government at this time is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to a formal release of a Request for Proposal.</p>
<p>Background: The government has pursued the Joint Precision Airdrop System concept for nearly ten years via several contracts as a proof-of-concept program through AFMC's Electronic System Center and the Army's Natick Soldier System Center. The incumbent research and development contractor, Planning Systems, Inc. (PSI) has developed, produced and fielded one hundred and sixty (160) developmental JPADS to date. PSI is presently under contract to accomplish development and operational testing of the development articles. These developmental units have been deployed operationally. Due to the research and development nature of the program with PSI, the government has not acquired a data package of sufficient scope and detail to allow a competent manufacturer to reproduce the development article. Additionally, there are unresolved issues regarding the government's rights in the technical data delivered to date for this specific product.</p>
<p>Sources Sought: This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market research effort being conducted by Air Force Material Command, Aeronautical Systems Center to determine the viability of pursuing a competitive production acquisition of the current PSI JPADS design. Air Mobility Command desires that production deliveries of production JPADS begin in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Industry input is solicited on whether sources exist that could produce a production version of the PSI-developed JPADS product given the technical data constraints identified above. To assist industry assessment of this initiative, the JPADS overall system performance attributes are set forth below in the PADS General Requirements section. A sample of the existing JPADS mission system equipment is not available for reverse engineering or technical assessment at this time; however, if sufficient industry response indicates this is a viable method of establishing an alternate manufacturing source, this may be explored.</p>
<p>Request for Information: An alternative acquisition strategy being considered by the government is to competitively acquire a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) or military-off-the-shelf (MOTS) precision airdrop system that would meet the same system performance requirements set for in the PADS General Requirements. The government is interested then in obtaining information from industry on whether you currently produce or have developed equipment that meets the PADS General Requirements. If not, do you currently produce a product that could be modified on a non-developmental basis that would meet the General Requirements? The government would be willing to review any technical information on candidate products industry deems capable or potentially capable of meeting the General Requirements. As part of our market research, one-on-one Industry Days may be offered so that more detailed discussion of potential product solutions can be provided. Additional information on the annual production rate possible for candidate products would be appreciated as would any information on past sales and prices paid.</p>
<p>Although the JPADS/PADS production program has not yet been approved, Air Mobility Command foresees a potential for up to 260 sets of PADS mission equipment sets through fiscal year 2015. If approved, the production program may include a low-rate initial production phase prior to full-rate production authorization.</p>
<p>PADS General System Description: The PADS Mission Support Equipment will provide common PADS aircraft equipment that will integrate with the C-17 and C-130 variants and interface with the (existing) Joint PADS mission planner and U.S. Army GPS-guided payloads to realize the capabilities documented in the JPADS Capability Development Document (CDD). The system shall provide/enable the following capabilities to execute precision airdrop missions: 1) the re-broadcast of GPS signal in the cargo compartment for the dropsonde and payload Autonomous Guidance Unit to acquire time and location data prior to deployment from the aircraft; 2) Collection and processing of near-real-time dropsonde data from aircraft flight-level to ground-level at or near the planned point(s) of impact to feed the PADS mission planning system for Computed Air Release Point and Launch Acceptability Region generation.</p>
<p>PADS Operational Overview: The required PADS mission support equipment (MSE) will consist of a GPS retransmit capability and dropsonde data collection and processing capability to determine winds at or near planned points of impact. C-17 and C-130 aircraft are PADS MSE hosts. The requirement is for a common, transportable MSE Installation Kit for C-17s and the various models of the C-130 aircraft. The PADS is a roll on/roll off system.</p>
<p>PADS Mission System Equipment: The kit will consist of one half ATR line replaceable units for the GPS rebroadcast and dropsonde reception functions and include all cabling to utilize existing aircraft antennas and power receptacles to the maximum extent possible. Aircraft integration should be addressed with a common modular approach that can be used on multiple aircraft. No permanent modifications to the aircraft will be required.</p>
<p>PADS General Requirements</p>
<p>Note: A "T" following a performance requirement indicates a system threshold requirement.</p>
<p>Personnel shall be able to operate and maintain the Mission Support Equipment (MSE) system while wearing:</p>
<p>Night Vision Goggles (T)<br />Laser Goggles (T)<br />Cold Weather Gear (Gloves) (T)<br />Flight Gloves (T)<br />Chem Warfare Gear (T)</p>

This requirement has been met as part of a single National Aviation Maintenance Contract for approximately 20 years. The CBP P-3 aircraft are being separated from this contract to enable dedicated support for this complex aging asset.   The general nature of the required solicitation support has remained essentially the same; however, locations, equipment, and numbers of aircraft have varied.  The Government aircraft are assigned on a permanent and temporary basis to P-3 Operations Centers located at military air bases, civilian air facilities and alternate sites in the United States and foreign locations. The aviation program also provides air support to other government and law enforcement agencies upon request.

<DESC>Request for Information

The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) / Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) is exploring an effort to implement an Integrated Logistics Partnership (ILP) Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract that increases supportability of the KC-135 Flight Control Overhaul Program (KC-135 Overhaul) at OC-ALC, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center, Tinker Air Force Base.  This ILP establishes a contractual partnership for parts and services with a third party, private sector supplier of goods and services, hereafter known as the “ILP Contractor” and the government.  The ILP Contractor will be responsible for providing spare parts and services for the KC-135 Flight Control Overhaul Program to OC-ALC on a daily basis while being co-located with OC-ALC.  The ILP Contractor will coordinate and synchronize logistics and production processes to provide a predictable and reliable supply of items to meet normal, increased, and contingency (surge and sustainment) maintenance requirements.  

Sources are sought for a potential, initial 5 year program (single award) that will provide third party support for the KC-135 Flight Control Overhaul Program at Tinker Air Force Base. The prospective ILP Contractor will act as the single point of contact for all KC-135 Flight Control Overhaul Program parts.  Outcomes will lead to increased operational availability, improved operational reliability, reduced logistics response time, and reduced cost per overhaul.  An estimated 2500-2800 NSNs may be covered under this initiative with the possibility for additional NSNs after contract award.  An initial list of NSNs is available at the website listed below under ILP KC-135 NSNs.  However, items to be included in this effort may not be limited to those identified in this notice.  The anticipated scope of services is:

Procurement/purchasing – 
	Order parts from DLA
	If not available, purchase parts from OEM or other approved suppliers.
	
Inventory management/storage/warehousing –
   The ILP Partner will maintain a separate warehouse in the area of Tinker AFB.
   Provide storage and warehousing of all required NSNs.
   Required to fill the KC-135 Overhaul bins at Tinker AFB.
   Expedite parts when necessary

Forecasting collaboration with OC-ALC –
        Forecast future requirements/demand patterns.  
       Zero Stock outs – 100% Stock Availability of all NSNs/parts
       No lost production man-hours
      A Continuous flow of parts
     Flexibility for program changes

The Naval Air Systems Command, Aircrew Endurance Program seeks interested vendors to support production of a new man mounted survival item/body armor carrier. This carrier will be a replacement for the currently fielded survival vest and body armor worn by USN and USMC operators of H-46, H-53, UH-1, H-60, V-22, and AH-1 aircraft. Competitive production contract(s) to a Navy specification will be awarded in 2010. This notice is to announce an industry day to be held 19 June 2008 so that potential suppliers may be prepared to present webbings, hardware components, harness components, and fabrics that may be incorporated into the manufacturing specification to enhance the capability of the system. The USN intends to present design and integration requirements as well as system design concepts during this Industry Day. Participation in this Industry Day is not mandatory and will not preclude any interested vendors from participation in the subsequent procurement. 

Specific hardware components sought include but are not limited to: webbing closures, pocket attachment hardware, pocket closures, garment closures, rip-cords, and friction adjusters that can be blind-operated with a wetted, gloved, hand; that will operate in the sandy conditions of the Middle East as well as wet rainy conditions; that are durable in extreme heat and cold, that have a matte finish; that have a 66 lb hardware retention strength, are snag resistant; that exhibit salt-fog corrosion resistance, high heat resistance, flame resistance; are  lightweight, low bulk, consistent multiple use, easily replaceable, and that have no parts or components that can accidentally detach or shed under rotor wash, high wind, or light impact.

Specific fabrics and tapes/ webbings sought include but are not limited to those appropriate for load-carrying  (e.g., 7-lb hard armor plate, 10-lb soft armor, 40 pounds of survival items). Such fabrics must be flame and high-heat resistant, and ideally, highly air permeable.  A fabric that can provide a slick yet durable lining for the hard armor plate to allow it to slip in and out of a durable outer pocket is also desired.   

Specific harness components sought include but are not limited to webbings, fasteners, friction adjusters, and closures that comply with ANSI Z359 for fall protection, and are flame resistant, high heat resistant.  Webbing fasteners shall meet not only all requirements of the hardware components above but in addition, be able to be quickly disconnected under tension, e.g., an aviator whose harness is snagged in an underwater emergency. 

Vendors may prepare a list of concerns and questions they may have regarding the requirements for this industry day. No written responses will be provided from the Government. Vendors are encouraged to bring product samples, test results, and evidence of Berry amendment compliance. Vendors are strongly encouraged to avoid the use of presentation software, and to avoid marketing and advertising content. Vendors are requested to provide the name of their company, organization, and/or division group. Vendor participation is limited to no more than 2 people per company. Vendors will have the opportunity to schedule an individual appointment for that day with Mary Marseglia of STV Inc beginning May 27, 2008 (301-862-2344). Each appointment will be no longer than 20 minutes in duration. The purpose of the appointment is to allow vendors to ask and answer questions in a closed forum. All questions and answers will be recorded and released to the general public. 

This is not a notice of formal solicitation. Requirements for delivery schedules, quantities, and qualification of units have not been established. However suggestions that may assist the Navy in preparing their solicitation are welcome. 

In order to request an appointment for participation in this Industry Day, interested parties shall contact Ms. Marseglia by electronic mail at mary.margseglia@stvinc.com only; no phone calls or other forms of contact shall be used. Industry Day will start at 830 a.m. and end no later than 4 p.m. on Thursday, the 19th of June 2008. Upon your request, directions will be provided, and you will be requested to reconfirm the appointment by a given date, and provide the names and titles of the parties who will be attending. The Navy will not pay for product research, development, qualification testing, re-packaging, re-design and/or information received in response to this announcement. Further, travel expenses will not be reimbursed by the Government for attendance at this event. The Navy may use support contractor employees from LME Incorporated, STV Inc, CSC, and KR Systems Inc to assist in reviewing any responses, product samples, or data received under this announcement and at the Industry Day.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATIONPursuant to FAR 15.202 (e)
Military Community and Family Support ServicesMILITARY ONESOURCE Program
The Department of Interior, Acquisition Service Directorate Herndon (AQD-Herndon) Procurement will handle this Request For Information.  AQD-Herndon is a Federal Franchise Fund Contracting Office within the Department of Interior under the authority of the Government Management Reform Act and provides contracting support to all Federal and DoD Agencies.   For an easier to read format of this RFI please go to our website at http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/solic/solicitations.asp.  
INTRODUCTION
On behalf of the Military Departments and the Guard and Reserve Components, the Department of Defense (DoD) requires a contractor to provide services in support of the Military OneSource program. This program, a primary source of information for troops and families, provides members of the Armed Forces and their families, about 4 million persons ("Client") at locations worldwide, with a broad array of information and referrals to both military and civilian resources for variety of needs to include counseling services.  
(i)  These services are available through the Internet, telephone (via 800 number and collect calls) e-mail, postal and face-to-face, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The contractor shall maintain the current 800 number and be responsible for all costs associated with the toll free services including service provider fees and usage charges. 
(ii)  It is understood that this is a dynamic environment encompassing comprehensive Support Systems related to military members and their families.  Unpredictable world events (such as terrorism attacks at home), military situations (such as deployments), and disasters may affect this contract, thus challenging DoD and the contractor with developing innovative options to support military members and their families in a "just-in-time" mode. 
BACKGROUND
Today, U.S. military forces are engaged in conflicts around the world in support of the Global War on Terrorism, most prominently in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). Ongoing deployments, changing demographics, and other challenges exert considerable stress on military members and their families. Concern over these and other issues can diminish mission readiness, particularly for those on the battlefield.
The GWOT has resulted in an unprecedented level of lengthy and repeated deployments of American military personnel to Iraq, Afghanistan and other international areas of extreme conflict.  These deployments into harm's way, which are viewed nightly on national television, have placed extreme stress on military families.  Stress on marriages is at unprecedented levels.  Military families are struggling to balance complex and competing demands requiring a wide range of problem solving skills to include: single parenting; communications; child care; financial stability; spouse employment; fluctuating family income; frequent relocations; isolation from other military families (Guard and Reserve families); family's education needs, etc.  The DoD recognizes that families also serve and is committed to supporting military families.  The Department intends to make expert telephonic consultation, referral, and information services and short term, situational, problem-solving counseling services available to troops, on demand.  
The Department of Defense (DoD) recognizes the reciprocal relationship that binds the military member, the military mission, and military families. Military OneSource demonstrates the commitment of the DoD to improving the quality of life for military members and their families. These information and support services, fully integrated with other resources available throughout the military community, reveal the concern of military leaders for the welfare of military members and their families. Military OneSource helps ensure that military members will continue to be mission deployable.

The Government is attaching a draft Statement of Work (SOW) for public comment as a part of this Request for Information.  The purpose of the draft is to afford the public an opportunity to comment on best practices and critical elements that should be included in the SOW.  Any comments provided should not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific approach to be proposed, but as an opportunity to improve an eventual solicitation package.  The Government has prepared a draft SOW to explain how the acquisition relates to the agency's program need and requirement for a contractor's solution.  The Government is in the process of finalizing the SOW and attempting to minimize questions prior to the release of the Request for Proposal.  The draft Statement of Work is being attached solely for the purpose of public comment and feedback.  This does not constitute a request for proposal.  Additionally, attachment 2 is provided and represents the vision for this requirement and a link to the Military OneSource website is also provided: http://www.militaryonesource.com/skins/MOS/home.aspx.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE & REQUEST FOR INFORMATION  

Sources Sought Notice & Request For Information Number:  YA1323-08-PB-0523

Release Date:     May 23, 2008
Response Date:  June 23 2008

This is a Sources Sought Notice (Notice) and Request for Information (RFI).  No solicitation is available.  This Notice and RFI is released pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry.

The U.S. Census Bureau is assessing the marketplace on the availability and viability of responding companies capable of meeting the fingerprint-training requirements detailed below:

BACKGROUND

The Census Bureau, Administrative Management Systems Division (AMSD), Census Hiring and Employment Check Branch (CHEC), is responsible for processing requests for criminal background checks on current Survey (Schedule A) employees, respondents, career appointees and Special Sworn Status employees.  This responsibility includes background check processing for the temporary employees hired to conduct decennial census pretests and for the Census itself.  The scope of the hiring effort is very large. During the peak hiring period for the 2000 Decennial Census, the Census Bureau conducted screenings on 3.7 million applicants, prior to selection and subsequent hiring of nearly 1 million employees.

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES

The Census Bureau seeks to procure services of a contractor to fingerprint and train newly hired fingerprint examiners in support of recruiting and hiring efforts for the 2010 Decennial Census, in the use of proper fingerprinting techniques to perform a successful fingerprint capture.

The contractor shall train the fingerprint examiners to properly fingerprint individuals using ink and cards during the course of a two-day training session totaling 9 to 10 hours.  The contractor shall also fingerprint all the Census fingerprint examiners during the training session and mail the completed fingerprint cards to the Census Bureau for processing.  The contractor will train and fingerprint over approximately 228,461 fingerprint examiners during an anticipated 18-month training period.

The training sessions will occur at various locations throughout the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the Island areas. The contractor shall be able to conduct the training at over 1,168 locations concurrently in late 2008 and early 2009 and over 14,156 concurrent locations in early to mid 2010.  The training sessions will continue through August 2010.  

The training sessions will be conducted in church basements, libraries, donated community space and the local census offices.  The training space for the sessions will not be known until a few weeks before the training occurs.   The training location is subject to change at any time, up to one day prior to the scheduled training date.

The contractor shall perform the following tasks to successfully train Census fingerprint examiners:

1.	Capture fingerprints of all class attendees for submission to FBI. Total number of attendees for whom fingerprints shall be captured is approximately 228,461.  

2.	Provide “hands-on” training that shall include (at a minimum):

Ø	Step-by-step training on how-to use fingerprint cards
Ø	Sep-by-step training on how-to perform fingerprint rolling of fingers and thumbs
Ø	Use of the inkpad
Ø	Step-by-step training on how-to perform 4-4-2 fingerprint process
Ø	Step-by-step training techniques for capturing legible fingerprints
Ø	Step-by-step training techniques to avoid fingerprint rejections
Ø	Testing of fingerprint candidates to validate the attendees are properly trained to fingerprint.

3.	During the training sessions, the Contractor will use Census Bureau-provided training materials, such as training videos, fingerprint examiner training manuals, and instructor training manuals.

DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTED

1.	Respondents shall submit appropriate information about their company that will provide the Census Bureau insight into their capabilities and experiences.  

2.	Respondents shall demonstrate relevant past performance relating to fingerprint training and provide referrals, if available.  The contractor must have demonstrated an ability to conduct a fingerprint-training session within the past year.

3.	Provide a detailed description of how the required training would be performed, along with the minimum lead-time and time frame anticipated to perform the trainings.  

4.	Provide an itemized cost estimate for the proposed fingerprint training including costs for trainers, general administrative costs, project management, and travel costs for a training session and overall total.   All travel expenses will be incurred by the contractor and shall be included in the cost estimate.  

5.	Respondents shall also provide information relating to business size and status (i.e 8(a), HUB Zone, etc), and any current Federal contracts and GSA schedules relating to fingerprint training services.

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  In accordance with FAR 15.201 (e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

Responses should specifically include (a) identification of the brand name (or equal) proposed, and (b) make or model number, (c) descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings that allow the Government a range of vision of the brand name (or equal) items.

The purpose of the RFI is to provide an opportunity for industry to enhance the success of any future procurement for these products.  Any information obtained as a result of this RFI is intended to be used by the Government on a non-attribution basis for program planning and acquisition strategy development. Providing data/information that is limited or restricted for use by the Government for that purpose would be of very little value and such restricted/limited data/information is not solicited. By submitting information in response to this RFI, submitters of such information impliedly consent to the release and dissemination of submitted information to any Government or non-Government entity to which WHS releases and disseminates the information for review. As such, to the extent that any information submitted in response to this RFI is marked as or construed to be proprietary or business-sensitive, submitters are hereby notified (a) about the potentiality that such information may be disclosed to third parties and (b) that submission of information in response to this RFI constitutes consent to such handling and disclosure of submitted information. This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only and the Government does not presently intend to award a contract at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI is subject to FAR 52.215-3.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION NOTICE ONLY for planning purposes. The US Geological Survey is a multi-disciplinary science organization that focuses on biology, geography, geology, geospatial information, and water.  Due to the varying sciences and related activities involved, the USGS is subject to most, if not all, environmental regulations.  However, not all research facilities are impacted by the same regulations.
The USGS is a matrix management organization.  Therefore, facility leadership comes from various directions. Given the complexity of the USGS, is it possible to create one Environmental Management System (EMS) that encompasses the entire bureau, and still follows the ISO 14001:2004 standard in order to comply with Executive Order 13423? Please provide your response with any comments or additional information via email only to jkelley@usgs.gov NLT 4:00PM EDT Wednesday, May 28, 2008.
NOTE: All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary - the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government. Materials submitted to the Government for review will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. This is not a request for proposals. The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses received under this announcement. 
All questions and concerns may be submitted to the Contracting Officer via email only at jkelley@usgs.gov.

<DESC>This is a notice of sole source intent by the Louisville District Corps of Engineers, to modify contract no. W912QR-07-C0007 with Hi-Way Paving, Inc. for Airfield Runway Upgrade at Johnstown-Cambria Airport, Johnstown, Pennsylvania.  This proposed contract modification is an out of scope modification to Hi-Way Pavings contract that was awarded in March 2007 with expected completion of June 2008.  The turn around addition (7,100 square yards of runway paving) must be completed by August 2008 to meet mission training requirements. The turn around pad for the 171st ARW (Air Refueling Wing) will allow the Johnstown Cambria County airport to be an alternate operating location (AOL) for the 171st ARW Alert Mission. Units located within the vicinity will not be able to air deploy unit equipment and supplies for mobilization and/or emergency relief operations until the turn around addition is completed. It is in the best interest of the government to modify Hi-Way Pavings on-going contract (90% complete), so that the turnaround addition may be fully coordinated by the prime on-site general contractor to avoid safety issues, possible contract claims from two contractors, warranty support and turn over delays. This announcement is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, for Other Than Full & Open Competition. This notice is not a request for offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written inquiries or comments regarding this announcement may be faxed to 502-315-6193, attn: Jennifer Anderson. See note: 22.<BR><BR>

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established five permanent regional offices and one sub-regional office.  The regional offices are located in San Jose, Costa Rica; Bangkok, Thailand; Dakar, Senegal; Nairobi, Kenya; and Pretoria, South Africa.  The Asia sub-regional office is in Kathmandu, Nepal.    
The OFDA/Asia offices cover the Asia–Pacific region, which includes twenty-six countries in South, Southeast, and East Asia and sixteen Pacific Island nations. This also includes the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which will soon receive disaster assistance from USAID, in transition from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The region of responsibility is comprised of rich and poor nations, and politically stable and failing states.  It is a region of diverse cultures, languages, topographies, and disaster vulnerabilities.

OBJECTIVE

The Asia Regional Team requires the services of a Regional Advisor (RA) based in its Bangkok, Thailand office to ensure that OFDA’s objectives for disaster assistance and strategic reporting and analysis are met. The RA will monitor and report on OFDA-funded programs and activities, and formulate disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This position requires an individual who is able to travel outside of Thailand on short notice for up to two-three weeks at a time, or longer, on occasion. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for on-going disaster activities related to disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs.  The incumbent will also work to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations (IOs), and non governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region. The Regional Advisor will be responsible for disaster analysis, program monitoring, and overseeing NGO partner implementation, and reporting to OFDA Washington, USAID Missions and US Embassies. 

A) Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the Principal Regional Advisor in Bangkok, the incumbent will:
•	Travel to the scene of a disaster or potential disaster and assist in initial assessments of damages and needs; determine appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions, in consultation with USAID/Washington and/or the Principal Regional Advisor; and provide timely reporting cables and other written analysis of these events;
•	Coordinate and maintain liaison responsibilities with representatives of host governments, donor governments, IOs, NGOs, U.S. Embassy, and USAID missions to facilitate cooperation and coordination in disaster response activities;
•	Monitor DCHA/OFDA-funded activities and report accordingly; 
•	Become certified and serve as a Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) for grants,  cooperative agreements and contracts under portfolio of responsibility; 
•	Serve as required on DARTs in times of disaster response; 
•	Maintain regular communications with the Asia-Pacific sub-regional office in Kathmandu, Nepal; 
•	Prepare specific requested field information and subject reports, as required by USAID/Washington. 
B) Disaster Preparedness - Working closely with OFDA/Washington and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the incumbent will assist representatives of host government organizations, IOs, and NGOs in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.
Specifically, the incumbent, in collaboration with OFDA/Asia team colleagues, will:
•	Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance for OFDA, USAID, local governments, and other donors/organizations as appropriate;
•	Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID and/or U.S. Embassy officials on OFDA efforts including the review of sector disaster response and plans;
•	Provide support for other OFDA initiatives in the assigned region as identified by the Asia-Pacific Regional Office.  Support may include assessment visits, project design/evaluation exercises and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;
•	Coordinate with other agencies/organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries and develop projects/activities for addressing these;
•	Work with representatives of local and regional institutions and private/public sector organizations to incorporate preparedness and mitigation into appropriate programs;
•	Prepare regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Regional Advisor will report directly to the Principal Regional Advisor for the Asia-Pacific Region.  However, for certain activities, the Regional Advisor will coordinate tasks with the Asia Regional Coordinator in OFDA/Washington.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
Supervisory controls will be minimal.  The Regional Advisor is expected to act independently with little direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.  The Principal Regional Advisor will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

12.  START DATE:  Immediately, once necessary clearances are obtained.

13.  POINT OF CONTACT:  See Cover Letter.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.

(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—


(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.

(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

 	(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

Filing Agency Protests
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>ADVISORY MULTI-STEP NOTIFICATION<BR><BR><BR>BIOMETRICS OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT SERVICES-UNRESTRICTED (BOSS-U) <BR><BR>Request for Corporate Qualifications <BR><BR>1.0 Description<BR>This Advisory Multi-Step (AMS) requests corporate qualifications from offerors responding to the Biometrics Operations and Support Services-Unrestricted (BOSS-U) acquisition, Request for Proposal W91QUZ-08-R-0032.  This pre-solicitation notice requests information from prospective offerors allowing the BTF/ITEC4 evaluation team to determine the likelihood of each respondents ability to provide the services and supplies needed to fulfill the BTFs BOSS-U requirements.  Based on an evaluation of each prospective offerors response to this notice, the firm will be notified as to whether they are considered a viable competitor for the BOSS-U contract.  Notification of a prospective offerors non viability is advisory, and respondents so notified can submit proposals should they elect to do so.  <BR>The authority and basis for conducting the Advisory Multi-Step process is contained in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.202.  The FAR describes the process as follows:<BR><BR>FAR 15.202 - Advisory Multi-Step Process. <BR><BR>(a) The agency may publish a pre-solicitation notice (see 5.204) that provides a general description of the scope or purpose of the acquisition and invites potential offerors to submit information that allows the Government to advise the offerors about their potential to be viable competitors. The pre-solicitation notice should identify the information that must be submitted and the criteria that will be used in making the initial evaluation. Information sought may be limited to a statement of qualifications and other appropriate information (e.g., proposed technical concept, past performance, and limited pricing information). At a minimum, the notice shall contain sufficient information to permit a potential offeror to make an informed decision about whether to participate in the acquisition. This process should not be used for multi-step acquisitions where it would result in offerors being required to submit identical information in response to the notice and in response to the initial step of the acquisition. <BR><BR>(b) The agency shall evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria stated in the notice, and shall advise each respondent in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. The agency shall advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion. The agency shall inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.<BR><BR>2.0 Introduction <BR>The BTF, in coordination with the Information Technology, E-Commerce, and Commercial Contracting Center (ITEC4), is seeking qualified offerors to support the DoD Biometrics Program. <BR><BR>The Army is seeking offerors who are willing to partner with the Army to meet its mission.  Per DoD Directive 8521.01E the BTF serves to act as the DoD proponent for biometrics, providing biometrics research, technology, and information management support to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Combatant Commanders, the Military Services, the Defense Agencies, and other DoD Field Activities, as required.  As such it:<BR><BR>1) Provides for the standardization of biometric data formats, technical interfaces, conformance methodologies, performance evaluations, and other related areas to permit interoperability, both internal and external to the DoD.<BR>2) Develops and maintain the policy, processes, and procedures for the collection, processing, transmission, archiving, caching, and tagging of biometrics data and associated intelligence.<BR>3) Develops the DoD Biometrics vision and strategy, in concert with the Military Services, Joint Staff, and Office of the Secretary of Defense.<BR>4) Provides a means for unified acquisition and procurement of common biometrics systems and equipment.<BR>5) Administers the DoDs Biometrics governance structure to enable the development and execution of common requirements, standards, architectures, and research and development initiatives to support common and joint requirements.<BR>6) Manages authoritative DoD repositories of biometrics samples and acts as a hub for biometrics data sharing, to include providing for continuity of operations and disaster recovery in accordance with ASD(NII/CIO).<BR>7) Coordinates all Biometrics program activities with identity protection and stakeholder organizations to ensure consistency with DoD identity management principles, directives, and vision.<BR>8) Conducts Biometrics Science and Technology, research and engineering for DoD, and other US Government sponsors in support of the DoD S&T roadmap.<BR>9) Designs, builds, fields, and sustains Biometrics solutions both in CONUS and OCONUS facilities.<BR><BR>The BOSS-U acquisition will be conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation.  Performance-based contracting (as described in FAR Part 37.6) is the preferred method for acquiring services. <BR>The DoD intends issue multiple awards, for a performance-based, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract.  The resulting contract has an estimated value of $498 million, and will have a three year base period with two one-year options.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the BOSS-U acquisition is 541611 (Administrative and General Management) under Sector 54 - Professional, Scientific and Technical Services.

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories.  In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.  The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.  The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.

Complexity

Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.  Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.

Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.  They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.  

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances – the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.  Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).  Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.  Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.

II.  Minimum Qualifications

•	U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.
•	Extensive experience in the engineering or project management field, including mastery of concepts, principles, laws and regulations associated with the broad areas of international relations, particularly as it relates to the development and implementation of post conflict and emerging development programs.  One year of this experience must be equivalent to the GS-13 level in the federal service. A Bachelor's Degree (B.Eng) from an accredited institution in Civil Engineering is desired at a minimum, Master’s Degree (MSCE) preferred.
•	Understanding of architecture and engineering principles sufficient to be able to investigate and provide information and guidance on the range of systems, processes, and components inherent in the design and construction of new buildings, training facilities and related structures.
•	Understanding of contract administration principles, regulations and procedures, including US Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), DOS Acquisition Regulations, and commercial procurement procedures.
•	Ability to communicate effectively, orally and in writing, as well as the ability to interact with individuals at all levels.
•	Ability to multi-task, working on and bearing responsibility for several simultaneous in country projects while keeping the overall program and bureau goals in perspective. 
•	Skill in using word processing, spreadsheet, and data base computer applications.  Significant Microsoft Excel experience and expertise is required.

III. POSITION ELEMENTS

Supervisory Controls: The incumbent receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the Division Chief, the Executive Director/Controller, the Assistant Secretary and DASs.  The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations.

Although acting independently, the incumbent coordinates and communicates with not only the AIJS Chief and the Executive Director/Controller, but also with senior level officials in the Department and at post, as well as senior officials in participating USG agency and foreign governments individually or jointly involved in carrying out the INL mission.  The incumbent’s actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.  Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.  The AIJS Chief, the RM Director, the Assistant Secretary and DASs rely on his/her judgment in carrying out this mission. 

IV.  EVALUATION CRITERIA

Description
The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) seeks to identify, and obtain information from, responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the electric distribution (NAICS 221122), natural gas distribution (NAICS 221210), water distribution (NAICS 221310), and wastewater collection (NAICS 221320) utility systems at Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), Florida.    Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2688 Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

Contractor will be required to assume ownership of the electric, natural gas, water, and wastewater utility systems at Tyndall AFB, Florida, and as the new owner, shall operate and maintain the system and provide utility services to the Government.  Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility systems.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter "Notice") is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.  Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 4:00 pm EST on Monday, February 20, 2008.  Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:  (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business).  The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool.  As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the March-April 2008 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.  Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.  

This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.

If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DESC Contracting Office.

Installation Description

The electric distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

Tyndall AFB purchases electricity from the Gulf Power Company (GPC).   The power is delivered through a Gulf Power owned electrical substation on the west end of the base near the hospital.  Power enters the Gulf Power substation by two 46 kV lines.  The Gulf Power substation steps the voltage down to the 12.47 kV distribution level. Each of the 46 KV lines capable of carrying 25 MW and installed in 1961, feed two separate transformers 20 MVA.  Both transformers at the Gulf Power substation serve Tyndall AFB.  In addition, Gulf Power owns approximately 52,400 Single Conductor Linear Feet (SCLF) of wire and 46 transformers associated with the Capehart feeder located in Bay View and School. 

The Gulf Power transformers supply power to four (4) Bays located within the Gulf Power substation.  Each of the four Bays has a vacuum circuit breaker and three regulators per phase.  The power is then distributed over the government owned distribution system by six radial distribution feeders.  Bay #1 has Wherry and Mississippi feeders, Bay #2 has Suwannee feeder, Bay #3 has Hospital and Capehart housing feeders, and Bay #4 Flight-Line feeder.   The electric system in the Bayview MFH area is owned by Gulf Power.

The nominal distribution system voltage is 12.47 kV grounded wye.  All of the government owned feeders at Tyndall AFB are operated as radial feeders with predominantly overhead construction using wood poles.  The backbone phase conductor size used leaving the substation on all these feeders is 4/0 copper.  However, there are generally a variety of conductor sizes used throughout the distribution system.  Most of the overhead conductors are copper, but aluminum conductors have been used in some portions of the system.

Tyndall AFB electrical distribution system consists of approximately 2,511,828 SCLF primary and secondary conductor.  The system is approximately 87.1% overhead and 12.9% underground construction.  The voltage is transformed down to the secondary utilization voltages at the load centers.  
  
The natural gas distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

Natural gas is supplied to the base via the Defense Energy Supply Center (DESC) contract and delivered to the base via Florida Gas Transmission (FGT) pipelines with local transmission by TECO Peoples Gas.  A single six-inch pipeline enters the base near the south side of the Dupont Bridge across the bay from Panama City and provides gas service for the entire base.  Service is supplied to the base at a pressure of 120 pounds per square inch gauge (psig), and distributed at approximately 55 psig.  The gas main passes through a regulator and valve station at the south end of the Dupont Bridge and all equipment after the regulator is owned, operated and maintained by Tyndall AFB.

The gas is distributed to the main base and two MFH areas (Wood Manor, and Felix Lake) on base through approximately 31 miles of underground pipelines.  The Shoal Point and Bayview MFH areas do not have natural gas distribution service. These lines are the property of the Air Force.  Most of these lines are steel (approximately 70 % of base total).  In some areas where it was necessary to replace lines due to new construction or repair, polyethylene pipe has been installed in place of steel (approximately 30% of base total).  The steel system average age is 40 to 45 years.  There is no tracer wire, marker tape or cathodic protection installed.  The average depth of burial is 36?.  The commodity supplier provides and maintains odorization for the system. 

TECO Peoples Gas meters the natural gas to the base at the fenced regulator station in front of building 5013 (Dupont Bridge).  There are approximately fifty-five additional secondary meters on base that are read, maintained and owned by the Air Force.  The contractor is responsible for monitoring, repairing and maintaining all gas meters.
The water distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

The water system being privatized is described as follows:  Tyndall AFB normally purchases all potable water for the main base complex from Bay County Utilities Department (Bay County).  In addition, there are six remote on-base sites that utilize their own wells.

Water from Bay County, for use by the base, enters the Tyndall AFB area at the Dupont Bridge, utilizing a single pipeline that feeds into the Bay County 5,000,000 gallon storage tank located northeast of Tyndall school across US Hwy 98.  The primary Bay County pump station then pumps to three distribution points along US Hwy 98 that connect to the Tyndall distribution system.  Delivered water pressure by Bay County averages about 70 psig; a pressure relief valve is installed at the master meters.  Pressures on base range from about 50 to 55 psig.  Three elevated storage tanks serve the main base for emergency use for fire protection should the main pump station fail.

Water is distributed throughout the main base through underground pipelines, ranging in size from 6 to 16 inches for the primary distribution system; in addition, there are smaller distribution lines and service lines to buildings and other facilities.  The original system was installed in the early 1940's using well water as the source, and upgrades and replacements have been added as the area expanded over the years.  There is no tracer wire, marker tape or cathodic protection installed on the system.  The average depth of burial is 36".

There are four backup wells on the main base, available only for emergency use.  These wells are connected to the primary distribution system and are flushed monthly, but are not currently permitted for use by the State.  However, consumptive use permits have been issued by the Northwest Florida Water Management Agency (NWFWMA) for emergency use only.  The backup wells are not included with the sale of the system.  The utility privatization contractor will be required to maintain the wells and operate them during emergency situations as part of a continuing service agreement.  Emergency operation requirements are described in Tyndall AFB Contingency Response Plan 702.

Tyndall AFB receives water from Bay County through its 5,000,000 gallon storage tank and has no operational water treatment facilities for the main base complex.  (Facility 909 was originally a water treatment plant, but is no longer operational and is not part of this solicitation.)  Water for fire protection is provided primarily by the potable water system.  There are also two deluge pumping stations, dedicated for fire protection; however, these are not included as part of the water system with respect to potential utility privatization.

The water system limits for privatization are from the master meter stations to building connections, including the building service lines.  Bay County maintains the master water meters and meter vault; however, the second vault containing the check valve pressure reduction valves are maintained by the Air Force and should be considered as part of the privatization process.  There are a total of three master meter (meters belonging to Bay County) connections along US Highway 98.  Point of demarcation for each will be at the outlet of the master meter box.

There are 25 secondary meters on base that are read, maintained and owned by the Air Force.  Meters that are found on site and that are not identified in table 5 and meters that are added as a result of new construction shall become the property of the contractor.  The contractor is responsible for monitoring, repairing and maintaining all water meters.  

The six remote on-base sites with well water systems are: Silver Flag; Wright Laboratories; Full-Scale Drone; Sub-Scale Drone; Alert Area; and Ammo Area.  Each site has one well, and the wells are permitted by the NWFWMA.  Chlorination is provided by a chlorine gas system at Silver Flag, and by a hypochlorite feed system at each of the other five sites.  A vertical turbine well pump is used at Silver Flag; submersible well pumps are used at the other five sites.  Silver Flag has a 150,000 gallon elevated tank, and the other five sites each utilize a small hydropneumatic tank for storage. Silver Flag is served by a single well with a 150-gallom per minute (gpm) pump.  The chlorination system uses chlorine gas and facilities include a Wallace & Tiernan V-100 chlorinator, chlorine booster pump and chlorine gas detector.  Point of use reverse osmosis systems are used at several of these sites, including Silver Flag, Wright Laboratories, Sky Ten test area and the ammo storage area.  To meet state requirements for removal of all wells, these sites will require connection to a permanent water source.  Bay County has installed a new water line feeding the City of Mexico Beach just a few miles southeast of Tyndall.  Tyndall AFB will require the Contractor to pursue its "best efforts" to assure that all these sites will be connected to the Bay County line and the wells put on stand-by for emergency use only.  Contractor will be required to work with Bay County to get these connections made.

The wastewater collection system being privatized is described as follows: 

	The wastewater system being privatized is described as follows:  Tyndall AFB sanitary sewer is connected to the Bay County Advanced Wastewater Treatment Facility (BCAWWTF) located north of Tyndall AFB.  Sewer system shall be maintained IAW the requirements of the government contract with Bay County Utilities Department (Bay County) for the treatment of Tyndall sewage.  The Bay County treatment facility is located on Tyndall AFB at the end of Boy Scout Road. 
	All wastewater on base (except military family housing) is collected and pumped into the primary wet well at the old-Wastewater Treatment Plant (old-WWTP).  The old-WWTP is non-operational for treatment; however, select components are used to facilitate collection and pumping of wastewater to the BCAWWTF.  The Pump House (Bldg 1722), Valve Control Facility (Bldg 1723), wet well, clarifiers, and primary force mains are Government owned.  These facilities collect and transport wastewater from Tyndall AFB and the City of Mexico Beach to the BCAWWTF.  The Bay County force main from the City of Mexico Beach also flows through the old-WWTP area to the wet well.  The two clarifiers at the old-WWTP are designated as holding tanks in case of emergency overflow.  There is no tracer wire, marker tape or cathodic protection installed on the system from Wood Manor, Redfish and Felix Lake.  The system average depth of burial is 42 inches.    
Housing sewage is collected through lift station facility 2873 and pumped to the BCAWWTF.  The force main ties into the primary force main along Boy Scout road.

<DESC>Amendment 001 is hereby issued to extend the closing date from June 2, 2008, 4:30 p.m. to June 9, 2008, 4:30 p.m. local time.

***********************The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement to purchase a multiple carrier wireless/cell phone in-building connectivity system, post implementation support and maintenance support.  MMAC is a campus environment and is comprised of over fifty buildings plus tunnels connecting certain major buildings.  The wireless/cell phone in-building connectivity requirement will start with the fifteen most heavily occupied buildings (see spreadsheet), the Security Command center and the tunnel area.  Options for adding buildings should be included.  This requirement is to provide all personnel with cell phone connectivity within buildings, in basements and tunnel areas.  This requirement should also take into account the radar signals at MMAC and should in no way interfere with those signals.
Various organizations have purchased and installed Wilson amplifiers, duplexers, and antennas.  However, the current equipment covers only specific areas of those buildings where it is installed.  The purpose for this request for information is to have connectivity throughout all buildings including the tunnel area.
If the MMAC telephone switch were to incur loss of function, the cell phone in-building connectivity would allow for communication to continue.  Also, when all personnel are sent to the basements and tunnel areas during times of impending weather, this connectivity would assure continued communication and could be utilized, if required, as part of disaster recovery communication.  
Drawings are currently available for the top fifteen buildings, however due to security risks, these drawings will be available on an as needed basis and will require a non-disclosure agreement.  The drawings will be signed out to the requesting party and will be returned to the FAA after use.  The drawings are in electronic format and require AutoCad software for viewing.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 517210; Wireless Telecommunications Carriers, with a small business size standard of 1,500 employees.
Responses to this market survey will be used to develop the source list for this requirement and to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, or the 8(a) program in lieu of opening the acquisition up for full and open competition.  
Interested vendors should respond with the following:1.	Documentation that clearly demonstrates that the interested vendor is capable of fulfilling the requirement as evidenced by answering the questions that follow.  (The format of the documentation is at the discretion of the vendor)a.	Can the vendor provide signal for wireless telecommunications (cell phones, pagers, Blackberry, etc) to building, including basement and tunnel areas.  If yes, please provide proof.b.	The FAA has a national wireless program and provides various carrier devices.  Can vendor's equipment provide non-carrier specific service?  c.	Explain how the vendor provides service in b.d.	What equipment is required?e.	Does the vendor install the equipment?f.	Does the vendor maintain equipment after installation?g.	Is there a instructional class that the FAA technicians can attend for certification to maintain the equipment?h.	Is the equipment currently installed in another government facility?  If so, include location and point of contact.i.	When is the vendor available to begin installation and how much time is required for completion?j.	The equipment would be located in our telecommunications' closets.  Is the equipment wall mounted, rack mounted, etc?k.	All buildings have shielding (older buildings have wire mesh, new buildings have metal faces).  Will vendor's equipment/signal work with shielded buildings?l.	Give an explanation of your company, equipment and services, not to exceed 20 pages.
2.	Complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.   The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.
The survey is not to be construed as a screening information request (SIR), nor request for offer (RFO).  As such, the FAA will not accept unsolicited proposals and will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial response.  The final determination by the FAA not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the FAA.
 All responses should clearly be labeled WIRELESS.  Vendors must respond by 4:30 p.m. (CST), June 2, 2008.  Responses should be submitted electronically in either a portable document format (ie. *.pdf file) or Microsoft Word to: Diana.Pickel@faa.gov.  FAA will not respond telephonic inquiries.
Note:  Any contract awarded resulting from this survey will contain the AMS Clause 3.3.1-33 Central Contractor Registration (April 2006).  Award cannot be made to a vendor that has not accomplished this registration.
