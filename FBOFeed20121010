<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), intends to award a sole source contract to Thermo Electron North America, 1400 N Point Parkway, Ste 10, West Palm Beach, FL 33407-1976, for the acquisition of PinPoint version 1.2 software licenses designed to process computer files generated by existing mass spectrometry instruments. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is 3 months.<br /><br />This acquisition is sole source to Thermo Electron North America because Pinpoint is the only software program that can be used to process data from all triple quadrupole instruments in use in our laboratory.<br />&nbsp;
<p>Pinpoint simplifies the creation of MRM assays by automating the preliminary selection of peptide transitions to be monitored. It predicts proteotypic peptides, determines the best MRM transitions, and builds the TSQ instrument method. We develop protein quantitation methods that require the incorporation of MRM methods into our mass spectrometry experimental method. Pinpoint makes this process easy by taking a protein sequence, doing an in silico digest, and reporting the parent and product ions that should be monitored by the instrument. This makes the development of new quantitative methods faster. In addition, the raw files generated by the entire family of TSQ instruments (including Velos-Orbitrap) can be analyzed using Pinpoint, providing unique data analysis for quantitative method development. The program is fully compatible with the instruments in use in our lab.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Thermo Electron North America. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 49879 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN August 30, 2012. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), intends to award a sole source contract to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 104 Airport Drive, Suite 2200, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-5023 for the acquisition of Analysis of Impact of Graduated Drivers License (GDL) Requirements in North Carolina. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 611310, Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools. The period of performance for this procurement is 19 months. <br /><br />The Highway Safety Research Center at the University of North Carolina has been a leading research institute that has helped shape the field of transportation safety. The University of North Carolina has been performing research analyzing the North Carolina crash database for many years and is familiar with the specifics of the state database.
<p><br />University of North Carolina is an internationally recognized leader in teen driver safety and the effects of graduated driver licensing (GDL). A previous study found that GDL decreases crash risk among new teen drivers (16 year olds), but might increase crash risk for teens who are no longer under GDL (18 year olds). This has serious implications for teen driver policies across the nation.</p>
<p>The current activity will take this research to the next step by analyzing North Carolina data month by month for the years 1991-2008. North Carolina is one of a few states that instituted GDL restrictions in 1997, so their data can be analyzed before and after the law.</p>
<p>Each state is responsible for collecting, managing, and analyzing their police-reported crash data. The result is that there is no nationally mandated way to uniformly perform these tasks. Moreover, data collection changes over time within a state. This makes every state's data different than the next, and different over time within the state; therefore, experience analyzing a state crash database is a uniquely developed expertise. Consequently, a contractor who has not immersed themselves in the North Carolina state crash data over the last several years (study period 1991-2008) would have to develop the expertise needed for this activity before acquiring the expertise needed to perform this contract.</p>
<p>The University of North Carolina is the only one known to possess all of the critical requirements necessary to successfully perform this project.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2012-Q-15093 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN September 2, 2012.</p>

The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing.
<p>The Eichrom products will be used to allow purification of Sr-90 from a mixture of radionuclides using the current CLIA certified method.

<a href="mailto:hq-nstrf-call@mail.nasa.gov">Claudia M Meyer</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters has released a solicitation, entitled NASA Space Technology Research Fellowships (NSTRF) - Fall 2013, on October 10, 2012. The solicitation is available by opening the NASA Research Opportunities homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/  , selecting "Solicitations," then selecting "Open Solicitations," and, finally, selecting the solicitation number "NSTRF13." NASAs Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT) seeks to sponsor U.S. citizen and permanent resident graduate student researchers who show significant potential to contribute to NASAs goal of creating innovative new space technologies for our Nations science, exploration and economic future. This call for graduate student fellowship applications, entitled NASA Space Technology Research Fellowships (NSTRF)  Fall 2013 (NSTRF13), solicits applications from individuals pursuing or planning to pursue masters (e.g., M.S.) or doctoral (e.g., Ph.D.) degrees in relevant space technology disciplines at accredited U.S. universities. This call is open to students pursuing advanced degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The goal of NSTRF is to provide the Nation with a pipeline of highly skilled researchers and technologists to improve America's technological competitiveness. NASA Space Technology Fellows will perform innovative space technology research while building the skills necessary to become future technological leaders. Selected candidates will perform graduate student research at their respective campuses and at NASA Centers and/or at nonprofit U.S. Research and Development (R&D) laboratories. In addition to his or her faculty advisor, each student will be matched with a technically relevant and community engaged researcher who will serve as the students professional mentor. Through this experience, students will advance their STEM education, gain relevant research experience, and enhance their understanding of the research process. Awards resulting from this competitive selection will be made in the form of training grants to accredited U.S. universities. This solicitation has two phases. Phase A is the application submission by the student. For the student applicant who is selected (Phase A selection), the accredited U.S. university, where the student will be enrolled for the fall 2013 term as a full-time graduate student, must submit a package (as specified in the NSTRF13 solicitation). The university submission constitutes Phase B of the solicitation; complete Phase B package submissions will result in training grant awards. The financial and programmatic support for NSTRF comes from the Space Technology Program within NASAs Office of the Chief Technologist. The fellowships are a component of the Space Technology Research Grants Program. Awards are planned to coincide with the start of the 2013 academic year and are subject to the availability of appropriated funds. This solicitation covers only new fellowship applications; renewal applications are handled separately. All Phase A applications must be submitted electronically through NSPIRES and are due on or before December 4, 2012. Detailed submission instructions for the student applicant are provided under "Other Documents" on the NSPIRES webpage associated with the NSTRF13 solicitation. Potential student applicants are urged to access the NSPIRES electronic proposal system well in advance of the proposal due date to register with NSPIRES, familiarize themselves with its structure, and to enter the requested information. Comments and questions may be addressed by e-mail to the Space Technology Research Grants Program Executive, Claudia Meyer, at hq-nstrf-call@mail.nasa.gov. Responses to inquiries will be answered by e-mail and may also be included in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document located on the NSPIRES page associated with the solicitation; anonymity of individuals/institutions who submit questions will be preserved.

<p>A Firm Fixed- Price, Indefinite- Delivery Indefinite- Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order type contract is contemplated. The Government anticipates the total life of the Contract shall not to exceed 60 months. The base period of performance will be twelve months from the date of award. Thereafter, the contract shall be renewable as provided in FAR 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (MAR 2000).</p>
<p>The solicitation will be issued as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health anticipates that the formal Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be available on or about November 1, 2012 and the pricing shall be provided as part of an on-line Reverse Auction. The IFB will be available under the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site at www.fbo.gov. The Government will not issue a hard copy of the IFB. All interested vendors must obtain the solicitation documents via the FBO web portal.</p>
<p>The IFB will require interested vendors to provide bid samples that meet or exceed the salient characteristics as specified in the statement of work. These samples will be evaluated by the Governments Technical Evaluation Committee and only those vendors whose bid samples are determined to meet or exceed all of the salient characteristics contained in the IFB will be invited to participate in an online reverse auction. In the event a vendor's bid sample fails to satisfy all of the salient requirements, the vendor's bid will be determined non-responsive and shall be eliminated for further consideration.</p>
<p>A reverse auction is a pricing mechanism used by the federal government. The reverse auction will be conducted by a firm that specializes in facilitating reverse auctions. Those vendors who are invited to participate in the reverse auction are then contacted by an enabler who the Government has contracted with to facilitate the reverse auction. The enabler ensures that the vendor's computer equipment is sufficient and then trains each vendor how to participate in the reverse auction. A mock auction shall be is held the day before the actual auction to assure that all participants are fully familiar with the procedures. The enabler shall address all technical questions concerning the reverse auction.</p>
<p>During the auction, the government sets a maximum price to start the bidding. Vendors place their bids electronically and are able to see the current lowest bid. Vendors continue to place lower and lower bids throughout the auction. Vendors will not know the name of the Vendor who has placed a bid but will only see the bid itself.</p>
<p>The date and time of the reverse auction will be made available as part of the IFB. The auction will continue until such time that the bidding stops and a final price is determined. The winning bid will be the lowest overall price for the specified linens and quantities.</p>
<p>Any question concerning this pre-solicitation should be submitted via email to the attention of the contract specialist Mr. Brian Lind at lindbj@cc.nih.gov.</p>

<DESC>The NAVSUP  Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) San Diego, Contracting Department intends to award a one year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Cost Plus Fixed Fee Delivery Orders on an other than full and open competition basis to Camber Corporation, 635 Discovery Drive, Huntsville AL 35806-280. Non-commercial procedures will be used. This requirement is for a one year bridge contract for continuation of technical, professional, and administrative support services for the Center for Civil-Military Relations (CCMR) at the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey CA. Camber will provide the following activities that promote defense reform through education on tailored subject matter areas including, but not limited to, International Mobile Education Teams and Civil-Military Relations courses, Professional Military Exercises, International Defense Acquisition Resource Management, Combating Terrorism, Stabilization and Reconstruction, Research and Education, Defense Institution Building, Defense Institution Reform, Global Peacekeeping Operations Initiatives, and Leader Development and Education.
 The contractor-developed course curricula and delivery will provide combat troops with vital cultural and language training and allow them to effectively address the cultural, as well as military obstacles, they must face in Afghanistan, Kosovo, Pakistan, and Iraq. This training is considered mission essential by commanders to ensure that these troops are combat ready upon arrival. Failure to accomplish this training will put soldiers in harms way.  The applicable NAICS code is 611710, business size:  $7.0 mil. Performance is expected to begin on 13 December 2011 through 12 December 2012. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, all quotes received by 1 November 2011, 3:00 pm PST will be considered by the Government for the purpose of determining whether or not to compete the requirement.
  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based upon the responses and is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NAICS 541620 - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Environmental Justice (OEJ) intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to the Local Government Commission (LGC) for $25,000.00 to act as a sponsor of the annual Smart Growth Conference in February, 2013. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.  It has been determined that the Local Government Commission has a cooperative agreement with the EPA to produce the annual Smart Growth conference with EPA on an ongoing basis. LGC has the expertise, experience, and conference management resources to produce the conference in a manner that supports the EPA?s Smart Growth office mission.  The Smart Growth Office has no justifiable need for additional event support through other contract services.  In order for OEJ to participate as a sponsor for the 2013 co nference, OEJ must work through LGC to provide funding support and to add environmental justice elements which support both the Smart Growth office and OEJ mission.  In order to participate as a sponsor, OEJ must also work with LGC to ensure EJ elements are integrated into areas of the conference as requested or identified by the Smart Growth office and OEJ.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA?s requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement must provide evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions or comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to Cara Lynch, at lynch.cara@epa.gov by October 25,2012.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. THIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION/REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  This is a sources sought notice for market research purposes only.  The US Army Contracting Command - Rock Island is planning an acquisition for the requirements of the Program Management Support Services-Three (PMSS-3) staff augmentation program. PMSS-3 is a follow-on to the current PMSS-2 Contract which expires 20 June 2014. The purpose of this synopsis is to identify qualified sources that can meet the Army's support services requirements. The PMSS-3 program is managed by the Program Executive Office, Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), Operations  Directorate (OD), Contracts Compliance and Management Division (CACD), Ft Belvoir, VA 22060. The purpose of PMSS-3 is to provide the full range of information technology-related program management support services, to include advisory and acquisition consulting services, required by PEO EIS headquarters, directorates, program/project/product offices, and PEO EIS related organizations in support of various missions and of command, control, and communications activities.  The PMSS-3 acquisition will provide the requiring offices with the means to acquire and select from new sources of assets and capabilities to support their program management support services requirements.  For more information about the PEO EIS organization, see the following website: www.eis.army.mil <br> <br>Statement of Need.  Successful PMSS-3 contractors shall ensure that a broad range of expertise is available in many disciplines and specifically in the functional areas of Program/Project/Product Management; Business Process Reengineering (BPR); Information Systems Security; Contingency Planning; Physical Security; Enterprise Design, Integration, and Consolidation; Systems Operation and Maintenance; Integrated Logistics Support; Acquisition Management Support and other Information Technology-related Services for the life cycle activities that are required by the organizations.  <br><br>Capability Statement. An interested source may provide a corporate capability statement. The statement shall explain why the source believes that it has the technical capability to meet the Government's requirements to include experience of personnel, organizational history on meeting this or similar requirements, corporate acumen in managing multiple government contracts of the same or similar nature, ability to expand its workforce to perform multiple, concurrent, high-value task orders, e.g. through teaming, hiring, internal reassignment, etc.  The statement should also include an example in which it has succeeded in rapidly expanding its personnel capacity.  The statement shall include the source's website address; most relevant Government or corporate client (one client reference only) and POC for this client; business size and applicable NAICS codes; socio-economic status; number of employees; and annual revenue for the last three Government fiscal years. This statement shall not exceed 7 pages. The page limit does not apply to advertising material such as company brochures and catalogs. <br><br>Acquisition Strategy.  The Government intends to award five, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts.  Three of the contracts will be awarded on the basis of full and open competition, and two awards will be reserved for small business.  However, the Government reserves the right to award less than five contracts.  Issuance of Task Orders will be limited to PEO EIS components.  The geographic scope of the contract will include CONUS and OCONUS, and onsite work may be required in hazardous locations, such as Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan. The contracts and task orders will be performance-based. Task orders will be competed on a fair opportunity basis among all PMSS-3 contractors. The contract life will be 3 years.  The applicable NAICS code is 541611. The applicable PSC is R408. <br><br>Pricing Strategy. The Government intends to utilize multiple contract types for PMSS-3 contracts e.g. Firm-Fixed Price, Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Fixed Price Level of Effort, Time & Material and Labor Hour Task Orders. <br><br>Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCIs). Interested sources are advised that the provisions of FAR Subpart 9.5 concerning OCIs will govern Task Orders issued under the PMSS-3 contract and that potential OCIs with current and future procurements and programs may exist, in accordance with FAR 9.505-1 through 9.505-4, because of the tasks in the PWS, such as requirements management, specification development, program oversight, independent testing, etc. Consequently, the PMSS-3 contractors will be excluded from participating in these procurements and programs. It is anticipated that at a minimum all current ITES2S prime contractors may be excluded from participating in the PMSS-3 competition. <br><br>Due Diligence. A draft solicitation, pre-solicitation conference, and pre-proposal conference are not planned.  A best value evaluation will be performed IAW FAR Part 15. The Government will select the proposals that are determined to be the most advantageous to the Government. The evaluation factors under consideration include, but not limited to, corporate capabilities, price, past performance, technical/management and small business participation. <br><br>Schedule. The Government plans on releasing the PMSS-3 solicitation in the third quarter of CY 2011.  At the appropriate time an additional solicitation synopsis will be issued and the solicitation will be posted on the FedBizOpps web site.  <br><br>Response Format.  Responses shall be single-spaced, 12-point font, and not less than 1 inch margins. Based on the page limits set forth above, the total length of the response shall not exceed 7 pages, excluding company brochures and catalogs. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), a response to this synopsis is not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Response to this synopsis is voluntary. The Government will not award a contract on the basis of this synopsis, nor pay for information provided in response to this synopsis. This information will not be returned.

<p>A. BACKGROUND. The Office of Afghanistan/Pakistan Programs (INL/AP) is part of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) in the Department of State. The Bureau is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State. INL/AP provides policy guidance and develops, executes and monitors programs to address the full range of counternarcotics issues as they relate to stabilization and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan. INL has been engaged in an effort with the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to ensure a comprehensive approach to the drug problem. The U.S. Counternarcotics Strategy for Afghanistan targets narcotics traffickers through interdiction, while also supporting agricultural development, eradication, demand reduction, public information, and rule of law programs throughout Afghanistan.</p>
<p>B. PURPOSE. The Counternarcotics Advisor will support, assist, and advise INL in its efforts to expand counternarcotics programs in Regional Command-South (RC(S)), Kandahar. The Counternarcotics Advisor would provide expertise in a wide variety of settings, including internal U.S. embassy and multi-national meetings, to assist GIRoA in reaching its stated goals and objectives in reforming the counternarcotics programs in Afghanistan. S/he would offer assistance in a variety of areas, to include counternarcotics policy development and coordination with the interagency and international community and counternarcotics program development, management, and oversight.</p>
<p>I. STATEMENT OF WORK<br />&bull; Serves as INL counternarcotics advisor in the area covered by the Regional Command (RC), as directed by INL or the Senior Civilian Representative in the RC. As directed, coordinate with State, the Regional Command, USAID, USDA, international partners, and provide advice to Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and Regional Platforms on counternarcotics matters.</p>
<p>&bull; Aid in ensuring lines of communication between INL/Kabul, DEA, USAID, U.S./ISAF military, the GOA, and other international partners on counternarcotics programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Acquire a good knowledge and understanding of activity under all eight pillars of the GIRoA counternarcotics effort, as well as an understanding of how the counternarcotics effort is linked with counterinsurgency, anti-corruption, and rule of law efforts.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the formulations and implementation of policies/programs at the local and regional level.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with conducting program development, implementation, and oversight for new and existing INL counternarcotics programs, including, but not limited to working with Provincial Development Councils to develop proposals for Good Performers Initiative programs, Governor-Led Eradication, the Counternarcotics Public Information, and drug abuse prevention and treatment programs. Also, aid in the solicitation and delivery of resources and funding from third party sources (for example UK Embassy, ISAF, CSTC-A).</p>
<p>&bull; As directed, work with relevant partners from the Office of the Governor, GIRoA Line Ministries, and provincial and district leadership to advance shared interests in counternarcotics.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in tracking counternarcotics and related developments in the area of responsibility, including CN efforts by partner entities including the civilian and military counternarcotics efforts and USAID alternative development efforts in the province, among others. As appropriate, facilitate and promote counternarcotics engagement and assistance to the provinces within the RC by other international parties, including the United Nations and Coalition member states.</p>
<p>&bull; Facilitate visits to the RC for GIRoA counternarcotics officials and visiting INL, Embassy, and State Department delegations.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with providing regular reporting on developments in the field to INL/Kabul, INL/Washington, the State Department Senior Civilian Representative in the RC, and INL counternarcotics advisors and program officers elsewhere in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&bull; As necessary and directed, serve as general INL Liaison at the RC, connecting RC-based officers with relevant INL staff in Kabul, the rest in Afghanistan, and Washington.</p>
<p>&bull; Work effectively under pressure, within short time constraints, and during times of rapidly developing events. <br />&bull; Work collaboratively and effectively with senior leadership and colleagues from other countries, agencies, and departments to accomplish INL's goals and objectives.</p>
<p>&bull; Inform INL on current developments in a given portfolio that must be consulted in advance of important briefings, meetings, or presentations of new initiatives.</p>
<p>&bull; Produce a brief written weekly report on status of programs, activities, and initiatives to be disseminated via email to designated points of contact at INL Kabul, and INL/AP on a mutually agreed upon day of the week. Upon reporting to post, propose a format for this report, which should include, but is not limited to: recent and planned activities, accomplishments, challenges, proposed solutions, administrative issues, and upcoming schedule (to include TDYs and leave). Photographs may be included, as well.</p>
<p>Guidelines</p>
<p>Guidelines consist of various letters of authorization and memoranda of understanding between the U.S. Government and the Government of Afghanistan, as well as existing federal regulations, Department of State policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account.</p>
<p>Complexity<br />Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of INL policies and programs, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.

Active planning involves anticipating future events and requirements, deciding or recommending what needs to be done, the people and other resources required, and the timing of the activities. <br />Operating within the country strategy, the incumbent will have ongoing opportunity to develop new ideas and approaches that impact on existing procedures and methods. The incumbent must absorb and understand a large volume of detailed information on policies and procedures for multiple disciplines. Within a loose framework, the incumbent will be responsible for meeting a series of mid-to-long term objectives through structuring work and resources. Often breaking new ground, this role will be highly complex and will require a highly developed analytical ability and judgment. The problems encountered in this position are often unique, highly complex, or conceptual. Covering a wide range of potentially conflicting issues, the incumbent must apply the highest analytical skill and judgment to determine the best solution from the range of possible alternatives. The work pattern will be typified by many different overlapping tasks with heavy disruption due to changes in priorities, external events, and other interruptions<br />The incumbent will interface primarily with mid-level officers inside the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and other international representatives at PRTs and civilian platforms in Afghanistan. The nature of the contact with embassy officers will be highly demanding, requiring the transfer of complex ideas and concepts. The incumbent will interact primarily with mid-level military, GOA, and international officials, although the advisor will sometimes meet with the governor of the province to which assigned. The nature of the contact will normally be routine, although often escalating to complex as competing/conflicting interests and security threats are encountered.<br />A broad range of highly developed oral communication skills are required for this position. The incumbent will, at various times, be required to transmit routine information, discuss sensitive matters with tact and diplomacy, provide complex explanations, persuade and influence, give formal presentations, express care and compassion, provide reasoned arguments, and resolve conflicts without compromising the organization's position. Finally, the incumbent must exercise leadership, in order to achieve objectives and get the job done well, quickly, and efficiently without recourse to close supervision or coercion.</p>
<p>Physical Demands</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, the work is principally sedentary, however frequent travel in and around Afghanistan is likely. While on a site visit there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances - the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Extended onsite visits to remote project sites may rarely be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.</p>
<p>C. POSITION ELEMENTS<br />Supervisory Controls: The incumbent will directly report to the Director of the INL Section (INL/Kabul) at U.S. Embassy Kabul through the INL/Kabul Counternarcotics Team Leader. The Department of State Senior Civilian Representative in Kandahar will provide daily supervision. Tasking will come from both INL/Kabul and INL's Afghanistan and Pakistan Program Office in Washington. The incumbent's actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations. Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.</p>
<p>Level of Effort: Hours for this full-time position will be the core hours of U.S. Embassy Kabul: 8:30am to 5:30pm Sunday through Thursday with a minimum of fifty-five hours per week.</p>
<p>Travel and Position Location: The position is located within Regional Commands throughout Afghanistan. Frequent travel in and around the assigned province is likely. All movements within Afghanistan will be covered by the U.S. military and/or INL air wing and motor pool assets, and all travel outside of Afghanistan will be covered by commercial airlines.</p>
<p>Pre-deployment support for the Afghanistan-based Advisor: The advisor will be required to attend four (4) weeks of basic familiarization training at the Foreign Service Institute in Washington D.C. prior to deployment.</p>
<p>Life Support: Life support for the Advisor will be provided by other USG service providers and is not to be included in this task order proposal. INL/INL Kabul will provide the incumbent with access to the Embassy compound. The incumbent will have access to hardened and/or regular cars (exact type will be dependent on the security situation) from motor pool for transportation. Housing will be assigned through the Embassy's PRT Office in coordination with INL and the PRT Commander.</p>
<p>D. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS<br />a. U.S. citizenship, eligible for a State Department Secret security clearance.</p>
<p>b. The incumbent should possess a university degree in a field related to the primary duties of this position. Examples include: International Affairs, International Development, Political Science; South/Southwest Asia, Middle East, Asian or Islamic Studies; Business Administration and/or finance; and Development Economics. A master's degree is preferred but not required.<br />c. A total of ten years of professional work experience directly related to one or more of the fields related to the primary duties of the position: program management, international development, public diplomacy/public information campaigns, agriculture or alternative livelihood assistance. NOTE: A SECURITY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUND ALONE IS INSUFFICIENT TO MEET THE EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENT OF THIS POSITION. <br />d. International experience is required; experience in Afghanistan or Iraq preferred. <br />e. Knowledge Areas<br />i. The incumbent must quickly acquire a detailed knowledge of INL programs, civilian and military planning, and applications to counternarcotics goals in the geographic area where assigned. The incumbent will be expected to give detailed advice on how these areas operate<br />ii. The incumbent must quickly acquire a detailed knowledge of the political situation; social, cultural, religious, economic, and legal frameworks; security situation; and the agricultural, infrastructural (roads, bridges, irrigation, etc.), counternarcotics strategy in his/her geographic area of assignment<br />iii. The incumbent should possess, at the time of assignment, detailed knowledge of at least one (but preferably at least two) of the following fields: counternarcotics policy, counternarcotics-related law enforcement, justice sector development, public information, agriculture livelihood development, economic livelihood development, alternative livelihood development, and/or drug demand reduction/treatment.<br />iv. Specialist knowledge may have been acquired through extensive training in the specialist area(s), through a considerable amount of work experience in the field, or a combination of the two. Due to this background, the incumbent will be influential within the entire program and will likely provide detailed advice to non-specialist and other specialists.<br />f. Any degree of fluency in Pashto or Dari is desired, as is experience in working with an interpreter.<br />g. A range of written communication skills are required for this position. The incumbent will, at various times, be required to transmit routine information to other international advisors through e-mail and fax, discuss sensitive matters with tact and diplomacy with the international community in both formal and informal letters and e-mails, as well as provide complex explanations, persuade and influence, and resolve conflicts in a written format without compromising the organization's position.</p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research.<br /><br />
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.<br /><br />Background<br />The Exhibition Program at the National Library of Medicine produces exhibitions about the cultural and social history of science, medicine, and technology for installation in the Library's Lobby, Rotunda Gallery and History of Medicine Reading Room, and for its traveling exhibition service. The Exhibition Program regularly produces educational resources, websites, and ancillary print pieces in association with these exhibitions. The Exhibition Program also occasionally supports minor architectural design requirements for the building manager.<br /><br />The exhibitions feature books, journals, photographs, and prints from the Library's collections. The exhibitions may include artifacts on loan from other institutions or individuals, and images, and graphics, used with permission, from other institutions or individuals, or produced by the Library for the project. Traveling exhibitions are graphic and not expected to include artifacts.<br /><br />To find more information about the Exhibition Program and its portfolio of exhibition projects please go to http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/about/exhibition/index.html.<br /><br />Purpose<br />The purpose of this procurement is to obtain professional creative services to develop exhibitions, ancillary graphics, and digital programs under the leadership of the National Library of Medicine's Exhibition Program staff and the Head of the Exhibition Program.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing a market search for large and small businesses in preparation for a future procurement.  Information submitted in response to this notice is merely used for internal market research purposes and no feedback will be offered to the interested parties that submit capability statements.
The EPA has a need for a contractor to provide the Office of Research and Development (ORD); National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) technical support for conducting risk assessments on environmental stressors and developing state-of-the-art methods, models, and guidance documents for human health risk assessment in three key areas of single chemical risk assessment, chemical mixture risk assessment, and microbial risk assessment.
Specific areas to be addressed in capability packages are as follows: (1) Experience in developing and revising component or comprehensive chemical hazard or qualitative risk assessment documents covering one or multiple endpoints. Specific experience with developing documents that serve as baseline health assessment documentation for the development of consensus positions in EPA?s Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS). Documents are generally focused on the development of cancer dose-response functions and deviation of oral Reference Dose (RfD) and inhalation Reference Concentrations (RfC) values and may include mode of action descriptions as well as dose response modeling; (2) Experience in developing and revising chemical toxicity assessments in accordance with EPA chemical toxicity assessment practices for less common chemicals with smaller databases; (3) Experience with exposure analysis for contaminants, mixtures, media- or site- specific cases to include determinin g exposure from pollution/contaminant sources, estimating and evaluating human populations, and performing statistical and computational analysis; (4) Experience with site or community based risk assessments; (5) Experience with public health outcomes; (6) Experience developing innovative human health risk assessment methodologies/procedures or the refinement and improvement of existing ones; (7) Experience providing risk assessment support to include science writing, risk communication, training, Superfund health risk support, data collection and compilation; (8) Experience with providing risk assessment data bases and computer tools; (9) Experience with analysis, document and issue paper preparations; (10) Experience providing risk assessment support; (11) Experience with providing information of the data collections and compilations activities pertaining to all sections of this acquisition; (12) Experience in the conduct of toxicological, health, economic, or exposure-spe cific literature searches. All products are required to be consistent with state-of-the-science approaches and methods in human health risk assessment, and will be expected to pass internal and external scientific peer reviews normally conducted prior to publication in peer reviewed journals.
The successful contractor shall provide all necessary labor, materials, facilities, and services in support of the efforts delineated by the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A draft PWS can be obtained from the OAM website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/index.htm.   It is anticipated that the contract will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE) starting in August 2013 with a one year Base Period and four Optional Periods of 12 months each. Approximately 76,000 LOE hours are anticipated for each contract period for a total of 380,000 hours.
The applicable NAICS code is 541990 with a size standard of $14,000,000. Any interested firms should submit a capability statement which demonstrates the firm?s ability to perform the key requirements described above. Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis. In the capabilities statements, contractors should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hubzone, 8(a), women-owned, small disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran owned concern. As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (FAR 52.219-14). The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses.
Responses to the above should be submitted to Adam Meier, USEPA, 26 West Martin Luther King Dr., Cincinnati, OH 45268, (or meier.adam@epa.gov) no later than 15 calendar days from date of posting. A separate synopsis will be issued for the Request for Proposal (RFP) resulting from this sources source synopsis.

In order to satisfy this capability gap, the PSPMO seeks to develop and field candidate products that meet or exceed the specifications provided in Attachment 1.  Of note is the Key performance parameter (KPP) of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance.  Commensurate with this goal, the PSPMO wishes to obtain information from commercial sources that possess candidate dengue diagnostic products capable of meeting (or have met) the KPP and that are capable of performing within or above the specifications provided in Attachment 1.  Respondents should describe only those candidates that:<br> 	Are capable of satisfying the specifications provided in Attachment 1<br> 	Are currently marketed or currently in development<br> 	Have a minimum maturity level equal to (at least) demonstrated proof-of-concept in a well controlled bench performance study<br><br>3.0 Background: Dengue Fever infection is the second ranked infectious disease priority of the US Military.  Development of a dengue diagnostic capability for use in a deployed setting is but one materiel solution being considered in the family of systems approach toward dengue infections.  In the absence of approved drugs and vaccines, prevention and early diagnosis remain the best option to mitigate the impact of dengue infection in US troops. Toward this end, the PSPMO assessing the commercial market for candidate dengue diagnostic products capable of fulfilling the capability gap. <br><br>At a minimum, dengue diagnostic system candidates must meet the threshold parameters shown in Attachment 1.  Ideal candidates will meet or exceed the objective parameters listed in Attachment 1.  At minimum, candidates must have demonstrated proof-of-concept in a well controlled bench performance study.  A preferred candidate is FDA-cleared or is capable of achieving FDA clearance within 3-years.   Candidate tests or technologies must be usable in an austere environment, preferably without the requirement for electricity or for ancillary laboratory equipment not provided with the diagnostic test.  It is preferred that the candidate will be usable by medical personnel (such as a medic or physician assistant) without specialized medical laboratory technician training (i.e., the test is CLIA-waived or capable of being CLIA-waived).  In addition to technical performance, the PSPMO is also interested in several non-technical characteristics.

The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) currently operates fourteen HC-144A aircraft. The end state for the fleet size is still under review but could include as many as 36 assets. The HC-144A aircraft is manufactured by EADS CASA based in Seville, Spain. The base CASA CN-235-300M provides the foundation for the USCG HC-144A aircraft. The USCG HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft are operated differently from general aviation in support of such Coast Guard missions as: Search &amp; Rescue, Surveillance, Logistic Support, and Law Enforcement Missions. These missions require frequent operation at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments which accelerate corrosion on airframe structures, engines and other components. The aircraft, the engines and their components are inspected by USCG personnel in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) periodic requirements and in conjunction with the USCG's specialized Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) and require tools and ground support equipment to accomplish this task.<br />USCG OBJECTIVES:<br />The USCG, Aviation Logistics Center, Elizabeth City, North Carolina is seeking alternate sources that can provide any or all spare component items listed in the attachment.

Additionally, detail if the product has been qualified for use in any Department of Defense (DoD) or Federal Government Aircraft. The applicable NAICS code is 336413 - Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing<br />REPLIES:<br />Please respond to the following questions: (1) is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified Hub Zone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm certified Service Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POCs and contract numbers? (9) If possible, provide POCs for civilian users for general usage of product questions.<br />After review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the USCG still intends to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published on the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) website. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future announcement. All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation separately.</p>
<p>Responses to this sources sought notice shall be mailed to Aviation Logistics Center, 1664 Weeksville Road, Elizabeth City, NC 27909, Attention: Richard Atha, Contract Specialist, MRS Division or emailed to Richard.L.Atha@USCG.mil.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast, Public Works Department, NAS Pensacola, FL intends to award a Task Order Modification to one source, (The City of Pensacola) under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2913 which allows the Navy to enter into agreements with gas or electric utilities to design and implement cost-effective demand and conservation incentive programs (including energy management services, facilities alterations, and the installation and maintenance of energy savings devices and technologies by the utilities) to address the requirement and circumstances of the installation. 

This Task Order Modification is referred to as ENERGY MODERNIZATION BLDGS 3221, 3460, 3828, & 3465.
 The Task Order Modification will implement several additional energy conservation measures (ECM) for NAS Pensacola as a result of a no-cost preliminary energy audit.  These ECMs were originally to be included in the existing task order, but removed prior to award.  NAVFAC SE has identified modification of the existing Utility Energy Service Contract Task Order as the preferred contracting vehicle to meet the requirements due to the nature and location of the work, and the potential benefits over other contracting vehicles to include avoiding duplication of costs and unnecessary delays.

Interested utilities may identify their interest and ability to meet the requirements stated herein and may submit their corporate capabilities for consideration.
 The submission must include the NAICS code and Cage Code.  A determination by the Government not to compete this task order modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6, Other That Full and Open Competition, FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and compelling urgency, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 8 intends to modify Contract No. EP-W-07-052 with Environmental Restoration, LLC., for continuation of existing environmental cleanup services and emergency environmental cleanup response services in support of Region 8's emergency and rapid response program at sites of release or threatened release of hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA); the Robert T. Stafford Natural Disaster Act and pursuant to the Federal Response Plan. These services cover sites in Region 8, which includes Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Utah, North Dakota and South Dakota.
<p>The planned contract action represents a three-month extension of the contract, effective October 23, 2012 through January 22, 2013, with a potential for three additional one- month option periods available, maximum extension through April 22, 2013. The modification is necessary in order to ensure continuity of critical environmental cleanups services at existing sites and to have the ability to respond to an emergency environmental cleanup within 2 hours of receiving an emergency response notification. Award of the contracts resulting from solicitation PR-R8-12-00139 is delayed, which necessitates the above existing contract be extended until the award can be made. Region 8's requirements to be covered by this extension include any actions required to mitigate or eliminate any hazard or damage to the environment resulting from: a release, or threat of release, of oil petroleum products; hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants into the environment; the threat of fire and explosion and incidents involving terrorist acts, weapons of mass destruction and nuclear, biological or chemical incidents; or natural or man-made disasters. In addition to emergency environmental responses, should they arise; the work to be extended represents approximately13 existing task orders under Contract EP-W-07-052. These on-going environmental cleanup services require uninterrupted support in order to address and reduce immediate risks to human health and the environment. It is in the best interest of the Government to extend the existing contract pending award of the follow-on contracts, which are currently under evaluation.<br />This notice is not a request for proposals. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written inquiries or comments regarding this announcement may be emailed to Kristin Farris at farris.kristin@epa.gov or Ellen Shannon at shannon.ellen@epa.gov.</p>

<DESC>INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE. The Federal Occupational Health (FOH) through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Division of Acquisition Management (DAM), intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis Magellan Behavioral Health, 14100 Magellan Plaza, Maryland Heights, MO, 63043.
<p><br />This action is being processed under the authority of the Subpart 15.002 (a) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Posting of this Special Notice is in accordance with Sub-Part 5.2. The intended award will follow policies and procedures set forth in Part 15 Contract by Negotiation.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 621330 with a size standard of $7M.</p>
<p>Federal Occupational Health (FOH), a component of the Program Support Center (PSC) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has provided occupational health programs for Federal employees for more than 65 years. FOH operates under the principles of the Health Promotion for Government Employees Act, Pub. L. No. 79-658, 60 Stat. 903 (1946), as amended and codified at 5 U.S.C. &sect; 7901, which authorizes the head of an agency to establish a health service program to promote and maintain the physical fitness and emotional well-being of Federal employees; 41 U.S.C. 231; and the Service and Supply Fund Charter.</p>
<p>To fulfill its mission, FOH designs and provides a suite of occupational health services for Federal agencies and their employees. FOH enters into agreements with customer organizations and either directly delivers occupational health services or contracts with qualified contractors to provide such services. When FOH uses a contractor, FOH monitors the contract and provides the technical oversight.</p>
<p>FOH is committed to an integrated approach to improving the health and productivity of the Federal workforce, which helps address both direct and indirect cost drivers impacting the Federal Government. To that end, FOH provides programs and services that support a wellness-focused culture of health rather than a treatment-focused culture of sickness.</p>
<p>FOH's goal is to align programs and services along a continuum designed to meet the needs of the Federal employees across all risk levels - health and wellness programs to keep healthy people healthy; health risk management for those at low and moderate risk; and referral for those with chronic health needs. Employee Assistance&nbsp;services play an essential role in FOH's overall integrated health strategy to maintain or improve the health of the Federal population. As part of a long-term strategy of integration and quality improvement, FOH follows the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) standards and criteria for Managed Behavioral Healthcare Organizations and Wellness and Health Promotion (WHP), which are outlined at http://www.ncqa.org/tabid/58/Default.aspx.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to continue the following services for the FOH Employee Assistance Program, currently being provided by Magellan Behavioral Health. The period of performance shall be for a base period of six (6) months, beginning November 1, 2012 with two (2) three (3) month option periods.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide a comprehensive EAP with services that include in-person and telephonic consultation and problem solving for wide range of personal concerns. The contractor shall provide educational and motivational activities; referral, monitoring, and follow-up services; behavioral health consultation and coaching; short-term problem-focused counseling; crisis intervention; management consultation and support; and union briefings.</p>
<p>Services shall be accessible through an FOH toll-free telephone number and will be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. The program shall include access to a national affiliate counselor network, work/life resources, 24-hour service center, and web-based resources.</p>
<p>Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit a capability statement that demonstrates their ability to provide the services required in the timeframe required. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE; THEREFORE, REQUEST FOR SUCH DOCUMENT WILL BE CONSIDERED INVALID RESPONSES. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days from the date of this synopsis, the Contracting Officer will proceed with issuance of a solicitation to Magellan Behavioral Health.</p>

<DESC>The US Marine Corps Base Miramar (San Diego, CA 92145) intends to award a sole source, firm fixed-price contract for cable services to Time Warner Cable.

This contract will cover cable television requirements aboard MCAS Miramar for the period of performance: 01 Ocdtober 2012 to September 30, 2013. The Government intends to award this contract on October 11, 2012. This is not a Solicitation for bids.

Time Warner Cable has been identified as the sole source for this requirement.

a. Cable television service to the Marine Corps Air Station-Wing & Base.
b. Cable television service will be provided by underground and existing vendor-owned lines to various locations within the Base.
c.
 Cable television service is required for Command Operations activities. Time Warner Cable, Inc. is the sole-licensed provider of cable service in the immediate vicinity to MCAS Miramar as defined by the city of San Diego.
d. Cable service agreements with the Government are for twelve month periods only.
e. Time Warner Cable, Inc. has provided this service for six years to MCAS miramar.
f. A Master Agreement with Time Warner Cable, Inc. was developed and undertook an expentive review of all options available to MCAS Miramar.

g.
 Satellite subscription services are not able to be hosted over the existing Base Communication framework without extensive and expensive upgrades.
h. There are no measures that can enhance nor increase competition for this requirement.
i. The estimated annual cost of calbe television service is $100,000.00.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>

The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

Hat size - your Blue Service Cap size may be different than<br>your beret size! We have many Soldiers who order the wrong Cap size. We have<br>set up a photo-based guide to help you take the proper measurement:<br><br><br>Collar - Measure around your neck at the point where the collar is worn,<br>pulling the tape tight enough to remove gaps between the tape and the skin,<br>but not so tight as to depress and discolor the skin. Round up to the next "<br>for your collar size. Another technique is to measure the collar of a<br>comfortably fitting shirt while laying it on a flat surface. Measure from<br>the center of the button to the outside edge of the button hole and round up<br>to the next 1/2'".<br>Chest/bust - While standing erect, but relaxed, measure around the largest<br>part of the chest or bust with the tape passing under the arms, remaining<br>parallel to the floor, and snug *. <br>Waist - While standing relaxed, measure around your waist where the trousers<br>are worn; generally this is the smallest part of the waist. Pull the tape<br>snug*.<br>Hips - While standing relaxed with your feet together, measure around the<br>fullest part of your hips (seat), keeping the tape parallel to the floor and<br>snug*. Remove wallets and cell phones from your pockets prior to taking the<br>measurement.<br>Skirt length - Measure from your waistline to the center of your kneecap.<br>Inseam - Measure the inside seam from the crotch to the bottom of the<br>trouser leg. A good technique is to measure a pair of well-fitting trousers<br>while laying them on a flat surface. <br>Sleeve outseam - With your arms held relaxed at your sides, measure from the<br>center of the back, over the shoulder, and to the bottom of the wrist bone<br>where the hand joins the wrist.<br><br> Description of Services/Introduction: The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment,transportation, tools, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform alterations services and provide requisite supplies as defined in this Performance Work Statement. The contractor shall perform to the standards in this contract.<br><br>  Evaluation Criteria/Basis of Award Seller whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Buyer on the basis of price, technical capability, delivery.

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor's CAGE code is in the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active".

<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.</p>
<p>(3) If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.</p>

<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Beginning in 2009, the USAID/OTI Sri Lanka Reintegration and Stabilization in the East and North (RISEN) program has worked to advance recovery in conflict-affected parts of the country by promoting increased social cohesion, economic security, and community resiliency in the East and North provinces. The program focuses on three main objectives: (1) Supports programming that builds confidence and resilience in conflict affected communities so that they can address issues nonviolently; (2) Strengthens capacity of and partnerships between local government and communities for improved service delivery, accountability and citizen participation; and (3) Promotes conflict prevention by building bridges between diverse ethnic and religious groups.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner, manages an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above. Activities range across numerous sectors including but not limited to media, stabilization, and peace-building activities.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Asia Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative or designee, and is based in Colombo, Sri Lanka.  This post is a family-accompanied post and does allow minor and/or adult dependents.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight, and management of the OTI country program.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Deputy Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the OTI Deputy Country Representative requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The OTI Deputy Country Representative is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The OTI Deputy Country Representative is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The OTI Deputy Country Representative has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The OTI Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the OTI Country Representative, the Deputy Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOS, international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with USG agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Evaluate proposals and work with diverse groups-many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	If required, travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull;	Mentor/train other OTI and implementing partner field staff as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/ editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	As appropriate, communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, the US Embassy, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation; 2) OTI contractor performance; 3) Foreign Service National (FSN) staff support needs and morale; 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other USG entities; 5) security concerns; 6) relations with local partners, including local, state and national government representatives; and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising the Foreign Service National Staff, including but not limited to program officers, administrative assistants, and drivers;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff as delegated by the Country Representative (e.g. Program Managers, Program Assistants, Program Admin Assistants, etc.).  Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests; and</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will report to OTI's Country Representative or designee in the designated country.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.  Though this is a senior field-based position for the OTI Sri Lanka program, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes.  Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the Supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Assessment teams or during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>While in Sri Lanka, the work is generally performed in an office environment.  However, the position also requires travel throughout the country of assignment, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>2. Is there any EMI requirements for these cables?</p>
<p>There are no requirements beyond those given on the drawings and/or the Description document.</p>
<p>3. Can we exceed 10 pages in our technical proposal (Solicitation states we are Limited to no more than 10 pages)?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>4. The PD states for delivery and Installation of the 17 cables (TC1-TC3, Adapter Cables shorting plug adapters) deliveries shall be made for the first 2 cable sets within 45 days of After Receipt of Order.... This is 6 weeks and for some of the material we need for the build the lead time is 4-6 weeks. We also need 2 weeks to build and test. Would it be possible to change the 45 days to 60days?<br /><br />If and only if there are no proposals that can meet this requirement it would be reasonable to assume that it would be extended to the shortest time frame given in an technically acceptable proposal. I would suggest providing a commitment date that can be realized in your proposal if you can not meet the specified one. At this time it will remain a requirement.</p>

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>The Government will not be responsible for returning equipment with a full tank of gas or paying to refuel the equipment at the end of the Period of Performance. DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>The Government will not be responsible for returning equipment with a full tank of gas or paying to refuel the equipment at the end of the Period of Performance.

Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PAST PERFORMANCE #2: PRICE #3: DELIVERY. PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC><p>The Program Management responsibility for the Test Mission Advisory Services (TMAS) effort, FA9304-12-R-0100, has moved from AFTC, Edwards AFB, CA to AFTC, Eglin AFB, FL. In addition, to more closely reflect the broader scope of the TMAS effort, the name for this acquisition has changed to Technical and Management Advisory Services (TMAS). The new TMAS program manager is Mr. Dale Bridges and the new PCO is Mr. Edward Miller. For historical purposes, previous TMAS synopses will remain under solicitation number FA9304-12-R-0100. The new TMAS synopsis is posted under FA2486-14-R-0002.<br /><br />The TMAS contract will provide for non-personal Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) to fully support Aerospace Research, Development, Test, Acquisition, and Evaluation (RDTA&amp;E) activities at Edwards AFB, Eglin AFB, Arnold AFB, and other alliance partners. TMAS embraces strategic and enterprise-wide concepts by making services available in support of interrelated and joint RDTA&amp;E efforts for partner and alliance units such as, but not limited to Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Eglin AFB, Western Test Range Partners (Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), Utah Test and Training Range (UTR), and Electronic Combat Range (ECR), System Program Offices (SPOs), Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC), Science and Technology (S&amp;T) communities, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and National Aeronautical Space Administration (NASA). An enterprise-wide approach provides, in terms of benefits, the ability to expand and create new relationships in pursuit of shared developments in new technical areas (e.g. directed energy and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)), and maximize synergies, efficiencies, and interoperability within and between these units, to fully support systems from concept to combat.<br /><br />The TMAS program will focus on both engineering and non-engineering program support, to include systems engineering, program management, acquisition, financial management, acquisition security management, information management, logistics, electronic warfare, and environmental management. It will also provide advice and assistance in the research, development, testing, acquisition, and sustainment of integrated flight test, air-delivered munitions, range support, and other areas as needed. It will be the primary source for satisfying A&amp;AS requirements as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101, Definitions, as supplemented.<br /><br />Information on the FA2486-14-R-0002 posting take precedence over information posted here.<br /><br />New Contracting Office Address: <br />AAC/PK<br />205 West D Avenue, Suite 433<br />Eglin AFB, Florida 32542-6864 <br />United States</p>

During the course of the on-line auction, offers' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A").

<DESC>Adversarial Modeling &amp; Exploitation Office<br />Request for Information (RFI): TASR Market Survey<br />Date: 10/03/12<br /><br />This is a request for information (RFI) issued by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) for information and planning purposes only. No awards will be made from the responses to this announcement. However, responses may be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a future acquisition. This RFI is issued solely for market research, planning and information purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the government pay for information solicited hereunder. All information received will be treated as public knowledge. Any piece of proprietary or confidential information should be clearly marked.
<p><br />I. Purpose</p>
<p>Through this RFI document, the Adversarial Modeling &amp; Exploitation Office (AMX), US Naval Research Lab seeks to identify software systems for possible inclusion and integration in a suite of crime and threat analysis tools for the Federal Protective Service (FPS). Specifically, we are interested in software applications developed by U.S. personnel which could be utilized for crime analysis, spatial analysis, or intelligence analysis by the law enforcement community. Software systems could include, but not be limited to, those which are currently utilized by organizations including municipal police departments, county and state crime and intelligence analysis centers, and by Federal organizations.</p>
<p><br />II. Background<br /><br />The FPS provides policing and security services to nearly all Federal buildings in the United States. It has approximately 1,200 sworn personnel and oversees the efforts of approximately 12,000 armed security personnel. The FPS is responsible for not only protecting Federal property, but also Federal employees, and the immediate geographic area surrounding Federal property. FPS personnel are therefore responsible for assessing and responding to information and intelligence at the local, state, and federal level.</p>
<p>The Adversarial Modeling and Exploitation Office, US Naval Research Lab is involved in an ongoing project with the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&amp;T) to assist the FPS to more efficiently and effectively use information. This effort is known as the Threat Analysis Systems Requirement (TASR) project. Through the TSAR Project, we are seeking to develop a full threat and crime analysis system specification for the FPS. The goal of this project is to identify and later develop tools which will assist them to use available data more efficiently and effectively to deploy resources and protect against threats.</p>
<p>III. Requested Information</p>

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice that a solicitation is scheduled to be released via FebBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) in the near future detailing requirements for a supply IDIQ requirement entitled: " Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) Tags".<br>  <br>SYNOPSIS:  The US Army Corps of Engineers plans to purchase passive integrated transponder (PIT) (134 - 136 kHz) tags for the next three years for research purposes associated with the Northwestern Division's Anadromous Fish Evaluation Program (AFEP).  A PIT tag is classified as a sonar reading tag under the Standard Industrial Code #3812 and is subject to radio frequency licensing.  The PIT tags needed are glass-encapsulated electronic device measuring approximately 12-12.5 mm long by 2.0- 2.1 mm in diameter for the large smolts and 8.5-9.0 mm long by 2.0-2.1 mm in diameter for the small smolts.  The tag can be coded with one of 35 billion unique codes.  As the tagged fish out-migration occurs, it passes though electronic interrogation coils established at seven permanent juvenile detection sites located at federal dams in the Columbia River Basin and other rivers, streams, adult ladders, etc.<br><br>Each PIT tag must provide the necessary readability, reliability, high performance standard, and uniquely coded passive integrated transponder tag designed for all detection devices on the Columbia River Basin.  Each tag must satisfy the Corps's requirements (without requiring major purchases of new receiver equipment (134-136 kHz range), new design of the Corner Collector technology, or compromised reliability).  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has a series of tests to evaluate how well new tag models would perform in the current network of interrogation systems. The type of test performed on the PIT tags are physical and electrical parameters (measurements, weight, resonant frequency, turn-on voltage), read ranges under different noise levels, maximum read speed under different noise levels, and impact of tag grouping on reading efficiencies (how close different groups of tags could be to each other without interfering with the transceiver's ability to detect the individual tags). Performance test are held in a controlled laboratory environment as well as under field conditions.  PIT tags must have been tested by Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission and approved by the PIT Tag Steering Committee which consists of members of various regional fisheries organizations.<br><br>PIT tags cannot interfere with other manufacture products that are already in use.  There can be no measureable effect on other manufacturer's products already used in the Columbia River Basin.<br><br>The supplier must be able to produce and provide large quantities of PIT tags in a short time frame in order to meet delivery dates driven by the timing of out-migrating juvenile salmonids and research activities.<br><br>Other Information: The solicitation will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities web site (www.fbo.gov) when released. Solicitation is scheduled to be issued as an IDIQ contract. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. <br><br>Conducting Business with the Government: In order for contractors to conduct business with the Department of Defense, the contractor must provide registration information to the System for Award Management (SAM). All Offerors must be SAM registered prior to receiving an award. Registration instructions may be obtained, and online registration may be accomplished, at www.sam.gov. By submission of a quote, a vendor acknowledges the requirement to be registered in the SAM database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from the solicitation.  No CD's or hard copies will be available.  The Government is not responsible for any loss of interest, connectivity, or for an offeror's inability to access the document posted at the referenced website. <br><br>Please indicate your interest by submitting a detailed statement of your firm's capabilities to supply the required items in a timely manner.<br><br>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Solicitation No. VA101-12-R-0053, Correction of Seismic Deficiencies, Building 100 Nursing Tower (NT) and Community Living Center (CLC), Seattle, WA
7.	X Company would like to request the addition of a second walk thru of the project for the second or third week of June.  This will allow subcontractors the ability to review the plans prior to this additional walk-thru.  If this is allowable, X Company would also request a postponement of the proposal date by approximately two (2) weeks.

Response:  The VA will not schedule a second site walk.  The hour and date specified for receipt of offers is not extended.
  
8.	The table of contents in volume 1A does not list specification section 01 32 16.13 Network Analysis Schedules although it is included in the body of the specification.  Please clarify if this specification is part of the contract documents.

Response:  Section 01 32 16.13 is part of the contract documents.

9.	Page 130 of the Solicitation, Offer and Award paragraph 1.19 E 1 states that the contractor is required to meter and pay for power usage with relation to "electric cranes and hoisting devices, electrical welding and any electrical heating devices".  With the amount of welding required for this project can this paragraph be modified to eliminate welding as requiring metering?

Response:  No.  

10.	Page 11 of the Solicitation, Offer and Award paragraph 1.21 A states equipment designated with an R symbol will require relocation.  We cannot locate any of this equipment on the bidding documents.  Please confirm that the successful contractor does not have to relocate any existing equipment or items.

Response:  1.21.A states, "Contractor shall disconnect, dismanble as necessary, remove and reinstall in new location all existing equipment and items indicated by symbol "R" or otherwise shown to be relocated by the Contractor."  Permanent relocation is generally not in the scope of this project; however, temporary relocation will play a major role in successfully completing the work, as will removal, storage, and reinstallation of existing equipment and items. 

11.	Page 7 of CD2 Project Narrative, Item #9 Noise states the following: "It is recommended that the VA engage an acoustical engineer to determine how noise may impact patients and the acceptable decibel level of both ambient and impact noise for this specific project.  This would also help inform the VA departmental phasing plan."  This paragraph also states the following: "mitigations may add cost and/or time to the construction project and are not currently within project scope beyond the basic VA specifications for construction noise limits, tool use, and working hours."  What, if any, noise mitigation factors are contractors to include beyond those noted in the specification section 01 57 19 in their proposal?

Response:  The Construction Noise and Vibration Analysis report was provided in Amendment 001.  The report contains recommendations.

12.	 Specification section 11 12 00 Parking Control Requirement is listed in specifications volume 1A but is not contained within the bidding documents.  Please clarify if any work is required related to parking control equipment.  If so, please issue a specification via addendum.

Response:  Parking control equipment is not part of this solicitation. 

13.	Looking through the specifications for the above project, I noticed that this project requires the fabricator is certified by AISC.  I feel that we are more qualified to perform this work as we have demonstrated on another VA project.  I would like to submit a substitution request to have this requirement waived for X Company, but I did not see a substitution request form in the specs.  Is there one in the specifications that I just did not see?

Response:  AISC waiver is not granted for this solicitation.  

14.	Are you aware of the various types of remodel projects and what they specifically are?

Response:  Refer to attached Revised Suggested Construction Schedule by VA dated June 22, 2012.  The Minor Projects are identified as 7 West Renovation and 6 East Renovation.

15.	Will the remodel projects be contracted out of your office?

Response: No.  The remodel projects will not be contracted out of the VA CFM Western Region Contracting Office. 

16.	Will those remodel projects be ongoing in the same phases/work areas as the seismic project?

Response:  Refer to attached Revised Suggested Construction Schedule by VA dated June 22, 2012.  The Minor Projects are identified as 7 West Renovation and 6 East Renovation.

17.	In the event of schedule impact by the remodel projects, will the VA give consideration to modifications to the project schedule and subsequent impacts to those schedule changes?

Response:  Refer to attached Revised Suggested Construction Schedule by VA dated June 22, 2012.  The Minor Projects are identified as 7 West Renovation and 6 East Renovation.

<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED</p>
<p>This individual Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) is for the authority to award a sole source Cost-Plus-Incentive Fee (CPIF) contract to L3 Communications/Interstate Electronics Corporation. The authority for this action is 10 &sect; U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii)(A), Only One Responsible Source and Not Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements due to substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE <br />AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>The proposed contract will require L3 to perform requirements analysis, design and development of MGUE receiver cards - i.e., Common Global Positioning System (GPS) Module (CGM), Ground-Based (GB) GPS Receiver Module Military Code (GB-GRAM-M), Standard Electronic Module (SEM) based GRAM-S/M for aviation, Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Mezzanine Card (PMC) for maritime applications - encompassing Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) technology to support the four domains identified in the MGUE Capabilities Development Document (CDD) through Preliminary Design Review (PDR). This contract will apply the technologies L3 developed under the Modernized User Equipment (MUE) contract toward design and development of a CGM and its integration into the GB-GRAM (Type II), GRAM S/M and PMC receiver cards. In addition to the new military M-Code signal, the CGM will enclose secure functions required to support user-applicable new GPS Information Assurance (IA) requirements defined in the GPS III CDD and MGUE CDD.</p>
<p>This contract will not require the delivery of any receiver cards; rather, it will require the delivery of technical data (e.g., PDR data package, CGM Interface Control Document for the interface between the CGM and its host receiver card, CGM/receiver card specifications, test plans, test procedures, test reports, documentation necessary to enable integration of CGMs into a wide range of application, special studies), computer software (e.g., Beta version of CGM software toolkit) and cost/schedule/financial data via Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs). It will be funded with 3600 appropriations.</p>
<p>IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN <br />COMPETITION</p>
<p>This request is made pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE <br />QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE <br />USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF<br />AUTHORITY</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A), full and open competition is not required when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The GPS Directorate has determined that the supplies described in Section III are only available from the source listed in Section II and from two other MUE contractors, because it is likely that award to any other sources would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Air Force that is not expected to be recovered through competition. GPS, an ACAT ID program administered by the GPS Directorate, is a navigational radio positioning, time transfer, and Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System consisting of three segments: Space Segment, Control Segment, and User Equipment Segment. The radio positioning and time transfer provides a signal environment, which enables GPS users to precisely determine three-dimensional position, velocity, and system time. The NUDET Detection System (NDS) provides the capability of near real-time detection, location, identification and characterization of worldwide nuclear events.</p>
<p>The Space Segment consists of the GPS satellite constellation with its associated ground equipment. The operational constellation includes Blocks II, IIA, IIR, IIR-M satellites, and will include III satellites. The Control Segment provides on-orbit operational control of the satellite constellation. That segment consists of the Operational Control System (OCS), Architecture Evolution Plan and Launch, Early Orbit, Anomaly Resolution and Disposal Operations capability, which will be replaced with the Next-Generation GPS Ground Segment (OCX). The User Equipment Segment consists of various handheld, shipborne and airborne platform receivers (e.g., Defense Advanced GPS Receiver, Miniaturized Airborne GPS Receiver 2000) and prototype receivers in various stages of development (i.e., MUE, MGUE).</p>
<p>As mandated by 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2281, the GPS Directorate's number one priority is to sustain GPS capabilities for military and civil users worldwide. To achieve this objective requires that the GPS Directorate maintain a constellation of satellites, an intricate and complex ground infrastructure to command and control those satellites, and thousands of fielded GPS receivers to enable military and civilian customers around the globe receiving signals transmitted by GPS satellites to carry out their missions each and every day. Modernization of the constellation with new signals and capabilities involves properly synchronizing changes to the Space, Control and User Equipment Segments, as well as the development of the next generation of GPS satellites. Current efforts are underway to develop a new generation of satellites with multiple blocks (GPS III), a new net-centric ground control segment (OCX), and a full spectrum of new modernized receivers (MGUE) which is itself a separate ACAT ID program. Recently Congress mandated that no appropriations provided to DoD may be obligated or expended to procure GPS user equipment after 30 September 2017 unless (1) the equipment is capable of receiving M-Code from the GPS or (2) the Secretary of Defense determines that suitable user equipment capable of receiving M-Code from the GPS is unavailable or DoD does not require that user equipment be capable of receiving M-Code from the GPS. (Pub.L. No. 111-383 &sect; 913).</p>
<p>The GPS Directorate competitively awarded a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) MUE contract to L3 (Contract FA8807-06-C-0003) on 26 May 2006 and that contract will expire on 26 July 2013. During its performance of that contract, L3 had to design, develop, fabricate and document two types of Y-code, M-code and CA-code receiver cards and their required internal support components based on the GPS Receiver Applications Module SEM-E/Modernized (GRAM-S/M) and Ground -based GPS Receiver Applications Module - Modernized Small Serial Interface (GB-GRAM-M-SSI). L3's receiver cards demonstrated the ability to receive and process the MUE signal as well as validate the Protection of Navigation security architecture. Accordingly, the proposed contract will be a follow-on acquisition for the continued development of a major system.</p>
<p>As a result of its performance of its MUE contract, L3 possesses extensive experience developing prototype modernized GPS user equipment featuring M-Code, encryption/ decryption, Selective Availability Anti-Spoof (AS) capability and Anti-Tamper (AT) protection. L3 has a subcontract with IBM, which is a trusted foundry. IBM's proposed role regarding the MGUE acquisition is to produce ASICs, which are then integrated into the receiver cards by L3. Utilizing IBM as a trusted foundry is a requirement of the proposed contract. Since the integration of Y-Code, M-Code and CA-Code onto an ASIC has never been done by any firm other than those firms that have performed on MUE contracts, L3 is part of a limited group within the industrial base that has personnel who possess knowledge and familiarity with the technology that will be developed.</p>
<p>The GPS Directorate believes that award to any sources other than L3, Raytheon and Rockwell Collins would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Air Force that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Since 2006, the GPS Directorate has expended over $155M for L3 to mature the technologies needed to successfully deliver the supplies described in Section III above. Any other source would have to expend at least the amount expended by L3 to be in a position to provide those supplies to the Air Force, to which would have to be added the cost needed to further mature those technologies through PDR (i.e., $31M).</p>
<p>Accordingly, L3 is one of a limited number of firms capable of providing the supplies described in Section III above without the Air Force experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition.<br />VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE <br />SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED <br />PRACTICABLE</p>
<p>In July 2010, the GPS Directorate issued a Sources Sought Synopsis for the supplies described in Section III with a posting through the Government Point of Entry (www.fbo.gov) under Solicitation Number FA8807-10-R-0002. The GPS Directorate received four responses to its request for Statements of Capability (SOC) before the Sources Sought Synopsis response period closed from L3, Raytheon, Rockwell Collins and Mayflower. The GPS Directorate determined that L3's, Raytheon's and Rockwell Collins' SOCs were acceptable but that Mayflower's SOC was deficient. To successfully deliver the supplies described in Section III, MGUE contractors must (1) satisfy Special Access Program (SAP) requirements (which include possessing a familiarity with SAP requirements and a SAP facility) and (2) the ability to produce ASICs capable of receiving Y-Code, M-Code and CA-Code within size/weight/power constraints. It took L3, Raytheon and Rockwell Collins two to three years to acquire that expertise and those SAP-cleared facilities. The GPS Directorate notified Mayflower that its SOC was determined to be deficient since Mayflower lacks SAP clearance, a lengthy process, and has no experience developing an ASIC that can handle Y-Code, M-Code and CA-Code, a new technology. Mayflower provided no response back to the GPS Directorate. Additionally, a pre-solicitation notice was issued on 19 Jan 2012 stating the Government's intent to award a sole source contract to L3 as one of only three responsible sources that has the necessary knowledge of GPS' next generation user equipment card technology. There was no response to notice. Given the extensive market research by the Air Force over the past 4 years has not yielded contractors outside of the 3 MUE incumbents who have demonstrated the ability to perform under MGUE, award to others would result in large duplicative costs to the Air Force.</p>
<p>This substantiates the government's position that only one responsible sources is capable of performing the work in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A).</p>
<p>&nbsp;VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE <br />ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND <br />REASONABLE</p>
<p>Based upon (1) historic cost information currently available under the existing MUE L3 contract FA8807-06-C-0003, (2) certified cost and pricing data that L3 will be required to provide, (3) Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) audit reports, (4) Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) recommendations, and (5) technical evaluations performed by the GPS Directorate, the Contracting Officer anticipates that the prices for these supplies will be fair and reasonable. To evaluate and determine whether the proposed prices are fair and reasonable, L3 will be required to provide Basis of Estimate (BOE) with supporting hours, labor mix and rates and factors.</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE <br />RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH <br />WAS NOT CONDUCTED</p>
<p>As described in Section VI above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition, and soliciting inquiries from interested parties.</p>
<p>IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND <br />OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE <br />ACQUISITION</p>
<p>See Section VI above.</p>
<p>XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO <br />REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE <br />MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES <br />REQUIRED</p>
<p>After L3 has successfully completed PDR and the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) has authorized the MGUE program to enter Milestone B, if authorized by the MDA, the GPS Directorate will conduct a full and open competition. This approach will result in the award of two contracts to commence Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) through Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) of MGUE receiver cards so as to meet the statutory deadline to field M-Code capable receivers not later than 30 September 2017 as described in Section V above. The technical data and computer software - and associated rights to that technical data and computer software - which L3 will deliver to the Government under the proposed contract, will permit other contractors to manufacture CGMs at their own expense, thereby permitting CGMs to be used in more platforms than the GB-GRAM-M and GRAM-S/M prototypes delivered under the MUE contracts. In short, the CGM will become the GPS engine for a new modernized GPS handheld receiver, as well as being easily adapted for integration into other applications beyond the lead platforms identified in the MGUE Capability Development Document (CDD).</p>
<p>XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION</p>

<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED</p>
<p>This individual Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) is for the authority to award a sole source Cost-Plus-Incentive Fee (CPIF) contract to Raytheon. The authority for this action is 10 &sect; U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A), Only One Responsible Source and Not Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements due to substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE <br />AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>The proposed contract will require Raytheon to perform requirements analysis, design and development of MGUE receiver cards - i.e., Common Global Positioning System (GPS) Module (CGM), Ground-Based (GB) GPS Receiver Module Military Code (GB-GRAM-M), Standard Electronic Module (SEM) based GRAM-S/M for aviation, Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Mezzanine Card (PMC) for maritime applications - encompassing Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) technology to support the four domains identified in the MGUE Capabilities Development Document (CDD) through Preliminary Design Review (PDR). This contract will apply the technologies Raytheon developed under the Modernized User Equipment (MUE) contract toward design and development of a CGM and its integration into the GB-GRAM (Type II), GRAM S/M and PMC receiver cards. In addition to the new military M-Code signal, the CGM will enclose secure functions required to support user-applicable new GPS Information Assurance (IA) requirements defined in the GPS III CDD and MGUE CDD.</p>
<p>This contract will not require the delivery of any cards; rather, it will require the delivery of technical data (e.g., PDR data package, CGM Interface Control Document for the interface between the CGM and its host receiver card, CGM/receiver card specifications, test plans, test procedures, test reports, documentation necessary to enable integration of CGMs into a wide range of application, special studies), computer software (e.g., Beta version of CGM software toolkit) and cost/schedule/financial data via Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs). It will be funded with 3600 appropriations. <br /><br />IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN <br />COMPETITION</p>
<p>This request is made pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE <br />QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE <br />USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF<br />AUTHORITY</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A), full and open competition is not required when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The GPS Directorate has determined that the supplies described in Section III are only available from the source listed in Section II and from two other MUE contractors, because it is likely that award to any other sources would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Air Force that is not expected to be recovered through competition. GPS, an ACAT ID program administered by the GPS Directorate, is a navigational radio positioning, time transfer, and Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System consisting of three segments: Space Segment, Control Segment, and User Equipment Segment. The radio positioning and time transfer provides a signal environment, which enables GPS users to precisely determine three-dimensional position, velocity, and system time. The NUDET Detection System (NDS) provides the capability of near real-time detection, location, identification and characterization of worldwide nuclear events.</p>
<p>The Space Segment consists of the GPS satellite constellation with its associated ground equipment. The operational constellation includes Blocks II, IIA, IIR, IIR-M satellites, and will include III satellites. The Control Segment provides on-orbit operational control of the satellite constellation. That segment consists of the Operational Control System (OCS), Architecture Evolution Plan and Launch, Early Orbit, Anomaly Resolution and Disposal Operations capability, which will be replaced with the Next-Generation GPS Ground Segment (OCX). The User Equipment Segment consists of various handheld, shipborne and airborne platform receivers (e.g., Defense Advanced GPS Receiver, Miniaturized Airborne GPS Receiver 2000) and prototype receivers in various stages of development (i.e., MUE, MGUE).</p>
<p>As mandated by 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2281, the GPS Directorate's number one priority is to sustain GPS capabilities for military and civil users worldwide. To achieve this objective requires that the GPS Directorate maintain a constellation of satellites, an intricate and complex ground infrastructure to command and control those satellites, and thousands of fielded GPS receivers to enable military and civilian customers around the globe receiving signals transmitted by GPS satellites to carry out their missions each and every day. Modernization of the constellation with new signals and capabilities involves properly synchronizing changes to the Space, Control and User Equipment Segments, as well as the development of the next generation of GPS satellites. Current efforts are underway to develop a new generation of satellites with multiple blocks (GPS III), a new net-centric ground control segment (OCX), and a full spectrum of new modernized receivers (MGUE) which is itself a separate ACAT ID program. Recently Congress mandated that no appropriations provided to DoD may be obligated or expended to procure GPS user equipment after 30 September 2017 unless (1) the equipment is capable of receiving M-Code from the GPS or (2) the Secretary of Defense determines that suitable user equipment capable of receiving M-Code from the GPS is unavailable or DoD does not require that user equipment be capable of receiving M-Code from the GPS. (Pub.L. No. 111-383 &sect; 913).</p>
<p>The GPS Directorate competitively awarded a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) MUE contract to Raytheon (Contract FA8807-06-C-0004) on 26 May 2006 and that contract will expire on 26 July 2013. During its performance of that contract, Raytheon had to design, develop, fabricate and document two types of Y-code, M-code and CA-code receiver cards and their required internal support components based on the GPS Receiver Applications Module SEM-E/Modernized (GRAM-S/M) and Ground -based GPS Receiver Applications Module - Modernized Small Serial Interface (GB-GRAM-M-SSI). Raytheon's receiver cards demonstrated the ability to receive and process the MUE signal as well as validate the Protection of Navigation security architecture.

<p>The GPS Directorate believes that award to any sources other than L3, Raytheon and Rockwell Collins would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Air Force that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Since 2006, the GPS Directorate has expended over $187M for Raytheon to mature the technologies needed to successfully deliver the supplies described in Section III above. Any other source would have to expend at least the amount expended by Raytheon to be in a position to provide those supplies to the Air Force, to which would have to be added the cost needed to further mature those technologies through PDR (i.e., $31M).</p>

<p>The GPS Directorate competitively awarded a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) MUE contract to Rockwell Collins (Contract FA8807-06-C-0001) on 26 May 2006 and that contract will expire on 26 July 2013. During its performance of that contract, Rockwell Collins had to design, develop, fabricate and document two types of Y-code, M-code and CA-code receiver cards and their required internal support components based on the GPS Receiver Applications Module SEM-E/Modernized (GRAM-S/M) and Ground -based GPS Receiver Applications Module - Modernized Small Serial Interface (GB-GRAM-M-SSI). Rockwell Collins' receiver cards demonstrated the ability to receive and process the MUE signal as well as validate the Protection of Navigation security architecture. Accordingly, the proposed contract will be a follow-on acquisition for the continued development of a major system.</p>
<p>As a result of its performance of its MUE contract, Rockwell Collins possesses extensive experience developing prototype modernized GPS user equipment featuring M-Code, encryption/ decryption, Selective Availability Anti-Spoof (AS) capability and Anti-Tamper (AT) protection. Rockwell Collins has a subcontract with IBM, which is a trusted foundry. IBM's proposed role regarding the MGUE acquisition is to produce ASICs, which are then integrated into the receiver cards by Rockwell Collins. Utilizing IBM as a trusted foundry is a requirement of the proposed contract. Since the integration of Y-Code, M-Code and CA-Code onto an ASIC has never been done by any firm other than those firms that have performed on MUE contracts, Rockwell Collins is part of a limited group within the industrial base that has personnel who possess knowledge and familiarity with the technology that will be developed.</p>
<p>The GPS Directorate believes that award to any sources other than L3, Raytheon and Rockwell Collins would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Air Force that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Since 2006, the GPS Directorate has expended over $131M for Rockwell Collins to mature the technologies needed to successfully deliver the supplies described in Section III above. Any other source would have to expend at least the amount expended by Rockwell Collins to be in a position to provide those supplies to the Air Force, to which would have to be added the cost needed to further mature those technologies through PDR (i.e., $31M).</p>
<p>Accordingly, Rockwell Collins is one of a limited number of firms capable of providing the supplies described in Section III above without the Air Force experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE <br />SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED <br />PRACTICABLE</p>
<p>In July 2010, the GPS Directorate issued a Sources Sought Synopsis for the supplies described in Section III with a posting through the Government Point of Entry (www.fbo.gov) under Solicitation Number FA8807-10-R-0002. The GPS Directorate received four responses to its request for Statements of Capability (SOC) before the Sources Sought Synopsis response period closed from L3, Raytheon, Rockwell Collins and Mayflower. The GPS Directorate determined that L3's, Raytheon's and Rockwell Collins' SOCs were acceptable but that Mayflower's SOC was deficient. To successfully deliver the supplies described in Section III, MGUE contractors must (1) satisfy Special Access Program (SAP) requirements (which include possessing a familiarity with SAP requirements and a SAP facility) and (2) the ability to produce ASICs capable of receiving Y-Code, M-Code and CA-Code within size/weight/power constraints. It took L3, Raytheon and Rockwell Collins two to three years to acquire that expertise and those SAP-cleared facilities. The GPS Directorate notified Mayflower that its SOC was determined to be deficient since Mayflower lacks SAP clearance, a lengthy process, and has no experience developing an ASIC that can handle Y-Code, M-Code and CA-Code, a new technology. Mayflower provided no response back to the GPS Directorate. Additionally, a pre-solicitation notice was issued on 19 Jan 2012 stating the Government's intent to award a sole source contract to Rockwell Collins as one of only three responsible sources that has the necessary knowledge of GPS' next generation user equipment card technology. There was no response to notice. Given the extensive market research by the Air Force over the past 4 years has not yielded contractors outside of the 3 MUE incumbents who have demonstrated the ability to perform under MGUE, award to others would result in large duplicative costs to the Air Force.<br />This substantiates the government's position that only one responsible sources is capable of performing the work in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A).</p>
<p><br />VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE <br />ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND <br />REASONABLE</p>
<p>Based upon (1) historic cost information currently available under the existing MUE Rockwell contract FA8807-06-C-0001, (2) certified cost and pricing data that Rockwell Collins will be required to provide, (3) Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) audit reports, (4) Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) recommendations, and (5) technical evaluations performed by the GPS Directorate, the Contracting Officer anticipates that the prices for these supplies will be fair and reasonable. To evaluate and determine whether the proposed prices are fair and reasonable, Rockwell Collins will be required to provide Basis of Estimate (BOE) with supporting hours, labor mix and rates and factors.</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE <br />RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH <br />WAS NOT CONDUCTED</p>
<p>As described in Section VI above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition, and soliciting inquiries from interested parties.</p>
<p>IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND <br />OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE <br />ACQUISITION</p>
<p>See Section VI above.</p>
<p>XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO <br />REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE <br />MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES <br />REQUIRED</p>
<p>After Rockwell Collins has successfully completed PDR and the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) has authorized the MGUE program to enter Milestone B, if authorized by the MDA, the GPS Directorate will conduct a full and open competition. This approach will result in the award of two contracts to commence Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) through Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) of MGUE receiver cards so as to meet the statutory deadline to field M-Code capable receivers not later than 30 September 2017 as described in Section V above. The technical data and computer software - and associated rights to that technical data and computer software - which Rockwell Collins will deliver to the Government under the proposed contract, will permit other contractors to manufacture CGMs at their own expense, thereby permitting CGMs to be used in more platforms than the GB-GRAM-M and GRAM-S/M prototypes delivered under the MUE contracts. In short, the CGM will become the GPS engine for a new modernized GPS handheld receiver, as well as being easily adapted for integration into other applications beyond the lead platforms identified in the MGUE Capability Development Document (CDD).</p>
<p><br />XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document evidences that he/she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief (FAR 6.303-2(a)(12)).</p>
<p>XIII. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>As evidenced by their signatures on the Coordination and Approval Document, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete (FAR 6.303-2(b)).</p>

<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p><br />1. Contracting Activity.</p>
<p>Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWC-AD) Patuxent River, MD</p>
<p>2. Description of the Action Being Approved.</p>
<p>This Justification and Approval (J &amp; A) authorizes, on a sole source basis, a single award Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract with Calspan Corporation for the supply, operation and maintenance of a Saab 340A Aircraft to support the U. S. Naval Test Pilot School (USNTPS) Airborne Systems Training and Research Support (ASTARS) Program at the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) located in Patuxent River, MD. . This action will result in a three (3) year contract which will consist of one (1) base year and two (2) option years. This will be a follow-on to contract N00421-09-C-0103, also awarded to Calspan Corporation.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services.</p>
<p>This acquisition is to furnish, operate and maintain an aircraft containing Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) consisting of sensors, computers, controls and displays to support ground and flight test and evaluation training on a representative, integrated system at U.S. Naval Test Pilot School (USNTPS). The aircraft selected for this action is a Saab 340A. The aircraft, supplied by Calspan Corporation, upon award of contract N00421-09-C-0103 which was competitively bid, was delivered and modified with GFE to support the training. The design, fabrication and installation by Calspan of the GFE on the Saab 340A was included in the performance work statement of the current contract. The existing contract was awarded on August 31, 2009 and expires on August 31, 2012.</p>
<p>See Appendix A for Estimated Dollar Value</p>
<p>4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>5. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority.</p>
<p>The current contractor, Calspan is the only responsible source that can satisfy agency requirements for the following reasons: 1) Duplication of Costs- Approximately $1,700,000.00 of non-recurring engineering (NRE) effort was required to install the GFE into the contractor provided aircraft that is required to conduct training while airborne and on the ground. The NRE also included insuring adequate power and cooling requirements for the equipment to be operated indefinitely and continuously on the ground and airborne. Additionally, multiple sets of GFE have been used to develop a lab based version of the sensors that can be used for training at less cost than flying assets, and function as operational spares for the primary flight sensors. If this requirement was completed and another contractor was selected, these furnishing and installation costs of GFE would have to be duplicated. <br />2) Unacceptable delay of work- Based on previous efforts, at least five and a half (5-1/2) months would be required if GFE is re-installed into another asset. In the previous procurement, it took five and one half (5-1/2) months from contract signing to first flight with USNTPS students. This resulted in an unanticipated delay in actual classroom training time, due to the installation and testing of all of the GFE. Calspan was responsible for the design, fabrication and installation of the GFE on their Saab 340A. The current contract required delivery of GFE at contract signing and it took five (5) months to complete fabrication and installation at the contractor's facility. The government does not own two additional sets of the GFE; therefore use of the GFE by another contractor would incur additional delays to remove the GFE from its current location. After arrival of the aircraft at USNTPS, there were two weeks required for government acceptance of the asset and training of USNTPS instructors in the use of the new systems. <br />3) Government is unable to meet requirements-If another contractor was selected, the USNTPS would have no asset available for training for approximately five and one half (5-1/2) months. This is unacceptable in a ten (10) month curriculum which has two classes in training at all times, with a six (6) month staggered start to provide approximately seventy (70) graduates per year.</p>
<p><br />6. Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Practicable.</p>
<p>The previous contract was funded to conduct NRE to host the government furnished equipment or install contractor provided sensors in an airframe capable of conducting in-flight instruction in the test and evaluation of the various sensors and their integration. During the previous procurement, only one other bidder could meet the technical requirements, but could not meet the delivery time required. Both Offerors required NRE efforts to develop a one-of-a-kind or unique asset for use by USNTPS. Only the contractor that was awarded the contract made the modifications required to a commercial airplane (SAAB 340A) to support the USNTPS mission. Market research has not revealed any assets that can meet these requirements without modification, and no funding is available for modification of aircraft until the contract is awarded. As such, there are no other assets available that can provide a completely operational system that is ready to use for instruction in the required timeframe. The current requirement was synopsized in the FedBizOpps on January 13, 2012 and responses were due February 3, 2012. No responses were received, except for Calspan.</p>
<p><br />7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.402, the Contracting Officer shall ensure that all supplies and services provided under this contract are procured at a fair and reasonable cost. The Contractor will submit a formal price proposal with certified cost and pricing data and sufficient information to support the accuracy and reliability of the estimate. Calspan's proposal will be reviewed by experienced technical and contracting personnel. Analysis will be based on historical cost data available from the most recent contract, as well as input from the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). The Contracting Officer will use this analysis as a basis for negotiating a fair and reasonable price.</p>
<p>8. Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition.</p>
<p>USNTPS continually searches for either military or commercial entities that could possibly host similar or improved sensors in a configuration suitable to do ground and in-flight instruction. No such assets are known to exist at this time. Release of the Request For Proposal (RFP) will proceed after the signing of this J&amp;A.</p>
<p>Upon completion of this contract action (30 Sep 2015), if market research can show that sufficient technological advances at reduced costs can be implemented within the limited budget constraints to support the non-recurring engineering work required to design, install, and test either contractor or government furnished sensors on an appropriate host aircraft, the follow-on procurement could be competitively awarded.</p>
