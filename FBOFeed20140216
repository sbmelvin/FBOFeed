This solicitation has been extended ** All bids are due Monday Feb 24th at 8:00am CST 
Questions to previous questions are below. 
Last day to submit additional questions will be Tuesday February 18th at 7:00pm CST 
Final questions will be answered Wednesday February 19th. 
Answers to questions received;
Proposals will be submitted to La'Quise Mack at La'Quise.Mack@va.gov
	Fill out the 1449 submitted on fbo.gov you may email the 1449 along with any supporting attachments. 
	It is your responsibility to ensure I receive your complete proposal. 
1.	Was the specifications written by a vendor and if so, will they be allowed to bid the contract and who is the vendor? 
"	The SOW was written by a panel of health professionals within the VHA.  Any vendor that contributed significantly to the development of the SOW will not be allowed to bid on the contract.  
2.	What is the budget for this effort?
"	The final budget is still being determined. 
3.	Is there a list of regulations for which this device must comply?
"	It is the vendor's responsibility to determine what regulatory standards must be met.  At a minimum, the device must comply with VA safety standards, which are based upon the most current NFPA 99 codes for healthcare facilities, and all applicable electrical safety and FCC codes. 
4.	Who will be responsible for costs related to FDA testing if necessary?
"	It is assumed that the product will meet FDA standards for a Class 1 device.  It is the vendor's responsibility to cover all costs related to obtaining all needed FDA approvals.
5.	Please clarify if "days" as used in the RFP are working days or calendar days.
"	Calendar Days 
6.	Would you consider a solution with a less complicated sensor that can accomplish the initial set of capabilities as well as future capabilities described in section B.2?
"	This query does not provide sufficient information to allow us to determine if the vendor's bid would meet our specifications.  Vendors are encouraged to supply detailed specifications of the product that they propose to supply in response to the offering.  The acceptability of each bid will be judged based on how well the vendor describes their product including its functionality and future capabilities. 
7.	We have a very unique product that monitors patient movements while in bed and in chairs.  I believe our system would be very similar to what is outlined in the solicitation and additionally includes several features that would further enhance patient safety.  It is already commercially available and has been purchased â€¦â€¦.with installation scheduled to begin next week. This would not be exactly as your Statement of Work, would this be acceptable.
"	Based on the limited information supplied in this query, it is not possible for us to determine the acceptability of the vendor's product.  The vendor is encouraged to supply detailed specifications of their product so that we can assess how well it would meet our specifications including product functionality and future capabilities.
8.	Would it be possible to interface with the folks who have put together the clinical/technical specifications and introduce our product for their review and consideration?
"	At this time, only bids are being accepted.
