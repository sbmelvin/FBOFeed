<DESC>In order to maintain a leveled competitive field of interested vendors, the following are industry Questions and FAA Answers regarding the Air Traffic Organization (ATO-S)Visual Analytics announcement posted on 9/12/2007.  The reference posting number is 6057. 1. Does the data to be analyzed include free text reports?  Yes, free text meaning unstructured.  Is the FAA interested in including these text fields in the analysis, in addition to structured data? Yes. 2. Should the software provide task scheduling capabilities enabling re-execution of the developed data analysis scenarios? Would be nice to have, but not required. 3. Would it be sufficient for the proposed software to provide its own OLAP cubes functionality? Yes. Would the FAA still want to perform OLAP cubes analysis in some external system? Possibly. 4. If having its own OLAP cubes is not sufficient for the proposed software, then which is more important: the support for MS SQL Server Analysis Services? Or SAS OLAP Server?  Don't know enough to answer, we use Oracle.  By SAS we mean Statistical Analysis System, not the company SAS. 5. Would the integration of the software with SAS datasets through an ODBC connection be sufficient? Yes, or Oracle. 6. Is the FAA interested in separating different user groups for the software: data analysts (who develop data analysis scenarios) and business users (who view easy to comprehend reports summarizing key results of the analysis)? Depends on cost. 7. Is the FAA seeking the Server/Client implementation of the software? Or the standalone desktop implementation? Five people to use whichever best fits.

The overall objectives are to observe, sample, and/or monitor post-lease OCS oil and gas operations in the Pacific OCS Region to determine environmental compliance (MMS regulations, Lease Sale Stipulations, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements, and non-MMS agency requirements, etc.) with mitigation measures or project conditions and their effectiveness.    SOURCES SOUGHT:  Interested organizations must submit a Capability Statement of no more than 20 pages that details the ability to perform the effort described above.  Emphasis should be placed on the organization's familiarity and understanding of the Santa Barbara Channel and the Santa Maria Basin in OCS waters off Southern and Central California with a secondary focus on the San Pedro Basin. Experience in the type of work proposed, demonstrated ability to do the work, and an understanding of the directed missions of the MMS, as well as the company's prior experience in work of similar scope to this project and complexity, qualifications of the organization's key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the tasks), and timely delivery of final products. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Provide three references of similar contracts performed by either your proposed key personnel and/or your organization during the last three years.  Include a description of the project, project title, contract number, period of performance, contract amount, client identification which includes agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official, address, and telephone number.  If you believe the Government will find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your company to address the problem.  Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.  EVALUTION OF CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  Your capability statement will be evaluated based on the following factors, which are of equal importance:  (1) the understanding of effort and objectives, (2) demonstrated experience and expertise of key technical personnel, (3) degree of past projects to the current project.  Responses are due no later than 12:00 Noon, E.T., on Thurssday, November 8, 2007.  Please submit three (3) copies of your response to the attention of Debra Bridge, Contract Specialist, Procurement Operations Branch, Minerals Management Service, MS 2101, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA  20170.   Questions regarding this Request for Information should be submitted via email to debra.bridge@mms.gov., no later than 3 p.m. ET, October 22, 2007.  Please include with any question your full name, the RFI No. 13633, and title "Environmental Mitigation Monitoring," your organization's name, complete address, and phone and fax numbers.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. This requirement is for a 3-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for Teradyne Spectrum 9100 Series Test Systems and associate spares and training, with a minimum/maximum dollar amount of $1.5M/$4.72M.  Inspection/acceptance points and delivery information/dates will be specified at the delivery order level.   The solicitation is available at the following address: http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate this contract on a sole-source basis to Teradyne, 600 Riverpark Dr., North Reading, MD 01864-2634.  The basis for restricting competition is that Teradyne, being the Original Equipment Manufacturer, is the only known source for each of the items that can satisfy the Governments requirements, and it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.    All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to Crane web site, FedBizOpps and NECO.  It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor the Crane web site, FedBizOpps and/or NECO.  Interested parties may submit inquiries or request for information by sending a fax to Diane Rhein, FAX 812-854-3465 or send a request via e-mail (e-mail preferred) to diane.rhein@navy.mil. Numbered Note 22 applies.

Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter sho!  uld not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or aff!  irmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or sim ilar past performance.  The assessment of the quoters past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/ . All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, Federal Tax ID Number, Cage Code, DUNs Number and payment terms. Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

<DESC>REQUIREMENT: General Services Administration (GSA) is interested in leasing between 5,900 and 6,150 rentable square feet of space in Billings, MT.  The rentable area must yield between 5,098 and 5,340 ANSI BOMA office area square feet.  The space will be occupied by the Census Bureau for operations associated with the 2010 Census enumeration.  The Census Bureau intends to occupy the built-out space by October 1, 2008.  The Lessor will be required to fund the tenant improvement costs and amortize the cost over the term of the lease. 
  
LEASE TERM:  Two (2) years and three (3) months fully serviced with cancellation rights after twenty-two (22) months.

UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS: The Government prefers that the space be contiguous and located on one floor.  If the offered space is located on two floors, the upper floor must be contiguous and configured in such a way that it is stacked directly above the adjoining space on the lower floor. Space cannot be located on more than two floors or be non-contiguous.   If the space is located in a building with two or more stories, the Government requires that the building provide at least one elevator, which must be a handicap accessible public elevator with freight capability.  The space configuration shall be conducive to an efficient layout.  Consideration for an efficient layout will include, but will not be limited to, the following: size and location of interior fire (support) walls, size and number of columns, column placement, bay depths, window size and placement, convector size and placement, electrical and telephone accessibility, any angles, curves or offsets that will result in an inefficient use of space.  The following space configurations will not be considered: space split by a public corridor; space with atriums or other areas interrupting contiguous space; extremely long or narrow runs of space; irregularly shaped space configurations or other unusual building features adversely affecting usage.  Space shall be located in a commercially zoned area and shall not be located near railroad tracks or other land uses that negatively impact normal business operations.  Space shall not be located within a flood plain or wetland unless the Government has determined it to be the only practicable alternative.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to negotiate a non-competitive contract with Colonial Parking, Inc., 1050 Thomas Jefferson St., NW, Ste 100, Washington, DC  20007, for rental of 13 parking spaces, for the period 10/01/2007 through 09/30/2008, at 500 N. Capital St., NW, Washington, DC  20036.  This requirement is being made on a non-competitive basis for the following reasons: (1) immediate response time is critical to the law enforcement efforts and therefore, the walking distance from the officer's office to the officer's vehicle at the parking facility must be no more than five minutes;  (2) each law enforcement Government-owned vehicle must have its own designated parking space where the officers can have access to the parking facility and designated parking space 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, at a moments notice to park or retrieve the vehicle; (3) the parking area where the government-owned vehicles will be park must not be in an open area; and (4) when parked, the vehicles must not be visible from the streets.  Market research shows that the parking facility at 500 N. Capital St., NW, Washington, DC  20036 operated by Colonial Parking, Inc. is the only facility that can fulfill all of the criteria above.

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Services are being solicited and awarded as a commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 12. This notice of intent is not a request for quote. However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by providing written response or quote to this synopsis to this office within 5 days of this announcement.  Response(s) must include sufficient documentation to establish capability to fulfill the requirement.  Documentation must establish that the contractor or interested party has a parking facility accessible to IRS at a moments notice and will accommodate IRS needs. Written response will be considered by the Government to determine if this acquisition will be made competitive.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<RESPDATE>103007
<ARCHDATE>10312007
<CONTACT>Herb Payne, 703-390-6472
<DESC>Project Description Project Description This project addresses the replacement of three separate engineering and power billing systems, two of which are obsolete and does not include the necessary engineering, billing, and accounting modules, with one cost effective current technology system that meets the needs of BIAs power projects.  The benefits of utilizing one system are significant and include:  1. Increased efficiencies and/or productivity  2. Compliance with applicable federal laws (i.e., the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA)), which promotes standardization and allows for easier automatic interface capability with the BIA accounting system  3. Improved ability to meet Departmental, OMB, and BIA reporting requirements  4. Cost savings through server-based modernization Purpose  1. Standardization of fully integrated utility software (engineering, staking, GIS, mapping, billing, accounting, etc.) systems 2. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations 3. Automated interface with the BIA accounting system 4. Replacement of existing manual or obsolete subsidiary systems/modules (i.e., staking, engineering analysis) Business Assumptions Existing service providers, custom designs and COTS products shall be considered. If the solution includes a COTS product, then database administration and system administration resources shall be required to support implementation efforts and on-going system operation and maintenance.  A portion of the cost for these services is included in the estimated fees for this project. An individual major application security plan shall be prepared as part of the project development lifecycle.  This shall include a risk assessment, threat analysis, physical, management, and operational controls, and a contingency plan.  The system shall conform to P.L. 100-235 and OMB circular A-130. Funding will come from power utility revenues. The vendor shall provide a comprehensive training plan. Technical Assumptions The chosen solution shall conform to BIA technology standards, and have a projected life expectancy of five years minimum. The team shall address four alternatives: As-is  Two of the systems are obsolete and do not meet the power utility requirements and all three do not interface with BIAs Federal system of record COTS  A COTS solution is chosen Modified COTS  A COTS product shall be modified to suit Full Development  A product shall be developed to BIA/IPSOD specifications (must include at a minimum; Customer Information Systems, Accounting, Billing/Collections, Engineering, mapping, automated staking, outage management, and must interface with common industry software for Engineering Analysis (e.g. Milsoft, Siemens), various Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Global Information Systems (GIS) and Automated Meter Reading systems (e.g., ITRON, Hunt)   Interfaces to External Systems  EUEBS (Electrical Utility Engineering Billing System) shall interface with the BIAs Federal financial system of record. EUEBS shall interface with the U.S. Department of Treasury for referring delinquent debt.  Background BIAs three power projects have either poorly designed, non-integrated, and/or outdated systems to satisfactorily meet the requirements of electrical utilities.  Two of the power projects systems perform billing and collections functions only and none of the three systems interface with the BIAs Federal financial system of record of record.  Two of the power projects are operated by BIA while the remaining power project is operated by a tribe under P.L. 93-638 contract.  Customers for all three power projects total nearly 40,000 accounts, comprising both Indian and non-Indian and span on and off-reservation.   Electrical Usage and Miscellaneous Billing EUEBS shall comply with BIA standards and Departmental regulations applicable to BIAs power projects.   EUEBS shall provide system modules typical in the utility industry; to include, but not limited to: Accounting (General Ledger, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable), Payroll, Purchasing, Customer Service, Billing/Collection and Deposit Account (method for tracking the activity in the two different appropriations-Billing/Collections vs. Deposit), automated process for working delinquent accounts (e.g., issuing disconnect work orders for those who received and dont pay by the date in the above 31 day letter), Fixed Assets, Inventory, Mapping, Engineering, Automated Staking, Work Order System, Service Orders, Outage Tracking/Reporting, Report Writer, and must be able to interface with Industry Standard Power System Modeling software (e.g., Milsoft, Siemens), Automated Meter Reading Systems ((AMR), e.g., ITRON, Turtle), various Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). EUEBS shall conform to the Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (GAAP), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) system of accounts, and the American Public Power Association reporting requirements. EUEBS shall have flexibility in developing special ad hoc financial reports. Delinquent Debt Management Interest Posting On a regularly scheduled basis, (15 days after the due date), interest shall begin accruing.  Interest is calculated on a monthly basis, using 30 days in a month, and posted according to the schedule (daily or monthly).  The interest rate charged is that in effect at the time and dictated by the Department of the Treasury. Penalty Posting On a regularly scheduled basis, beginning 90 days after the due date on a bill, penalty shall begin accruing.  Penalty is calculated on a monthly basis, using 30 days in a month, at a current rate of 6% per year.  Demand Letter Processing 16 days after the due date, a demand letter is sent to the delinquent debtor.  There is a charge (administrative fee) for the issue.  The administrative fee posting is associated with a revenue source code.  An adjustment is made to the accounts receivable in EUEBS, is created for the Federal financial system of record. NOTE:  In lieu of interest, penalty, demand letter and administrative fees, power projects may have the option to assess service, delinquent account, or disconnect/reconnect fees in line with standard utility business practices. Treasury Referral Processing All outstanding debts 120 days past due shall be referred to the Department of Treasury for collection.  BIA has the authority to change the number of days before referral to Treasury and EUEBS shall have this capability.  Exemptions are allowed under certain conditions. Once at Treasury, Treasury may collect on an account or return the debt as uncollectible,  After write off, the debt shall be moved to the currently non-collectible (CNC) portion of the database while it awaits proposal for, and acceptance of, termination by the Assistant Secretary  Indian Affairs.  While it is in CNC and termination is not final (signed), collection is permitted, with a journal voucher field entry to note late payment of this debt.   Once such an account is terminated, the status is regarded as closed, the debt is discharged and no action may be taken on this account.  All related records shall then be moved to a historical file, for viewing only. EUEBS shall have reports to perform the following reconciliations: - Reconciliation between EUEBS and the Federal financial system of record  - Reconciliation between Federal financial system of record and Treasury - Reconciliation between EUEBS and FedDebt   EUEBS shall comply with BIA and Departmental standards for Information Technology systems. SPIBS shall comply with BIA and Departmental standards for Information Technology systems. You may submit your interest via fax to Herbert Payne at 703-390-6582.

<DESC>Sources Sought - Candidate (Student) Tracker System

The US Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (JFKSWC), Fort Bragg, North Carolina, is seeking capabilities and commercial availability of Candidate Tracker Systems.  The Special Forces Assessment and Selection (SFAS) section is considering employing a system to track, record movement, alert, and retrieve candidates during individual training in a wooded environment.  

Requirement - The minimum requirements of the system include but are not limited to the following elements:

1) Tracking and Recording.  The system should be capable of portraying an eight-digit UTM grid location (or equivalent) of all candidates individually, plus or minus 15 meters in point accuracy, that discretely identifies each candidate.  This information must be displayed graphically to a company operations cell with a programmable update rate ranging from every 30 seconds to every 30 minutes.  Service must allow for a blanket coverage (tracking) of the Fort Bragg Northern Training Area, Hoffman Training Area, and Camp Mackall Training Area.  System must provide or be compatible with a graphical display capable of overlay on Ft. Bragg imagery and commercial maps.  System must be capable of future expansion to include tracking of all candidates in 1st SWTG (A) courses, at various CONUS locations, without transmission interference between groups at various locations.  System must NOT provide candidate user UTM grid coordinates or any other location information (without logging a record of the access to the information).  The system must not allow any candidate-to-candidate communications and must not allow the candidate to identify his location.  Cadre must have the ability to graphically show the route traveled, time traveled, and time spent at certain location immediately upon Endex.  The record of an individual candidate's movement during an event must be exportable as a JPEG and as data (ie. distance traveled, time stopped, time moving, etc) this data should be available at any time during or after a training event.

2) Transmission and Power.  System must be able to pass information between stations 6 miles straight line distance apart over exercise terrain.  System charge should be able to operate continuously for up to 18 hours at 30 second intervals and have a recharge capability of eight hours or less.

3) Durability.  System must be durable enough to be able to withstand impact of 100 lbs stopped within three inches, dropped from a height of six feet and be able to withstand submersion down to three meters for an indefinite period (allowing operation once recovered from water).  System must be survivable in extreme weather conditions associated with the Ft. Bragg and Camp Mackall area (ie. precipitation falling at a rate of one inch per hour for a 10-hour period and temperatures ranging from -10 to 120 degrees F).

4) Technical and Training Support.  System must include responsive end user support and maintenance, including 24/7 technical support to operations center and initial train-the-trainer support.  Maintenance turn-around time and mean time between system failures must not reduce the number of working systems below the number of candidates.  Examples of maintenance requirements include but not limited to:  Initial on-site training, updates of mapping software, and repair and/or replacement of inoperable units under commercial warranty.

5) Desired Features.  Emergency and Distress Capability.  The device carried by the candidates and cadre should be capable of alerting the company operations cell when:  a) a candidate is injured and a panic button is pushed; b) a candidate fails to move for a period of 60 minutes; c) a candidate leaves a predetermined area (boundary), and finally the company operations cell needs to have the capability to broadcast an emergency signal (audible alarm) to all candidates simultaneously to alert to impending extreme weather conditions.  

Sources Sought Instructions - USASOC is interested in locating sources for and possibly contracting with vendors who are currently using the most advanced technologies in the design and use of these items.  After review of technical information, the Government may acquire for testing purposes several vendors' products.  Those vendors proposing products that appear to meet the Government's requirements will be asked to send 20 systems each to be tested for one full class.  The vendor shall be willing to provide the equipment for review at no cost to the Government.  No cost agreements will be established to cover the product review time frame which will not exceed 30 days.  Equipment will be evaluated for suitability as tracking and locating devices and will be returned to the vendor.  This evaluation will be used to determine cost and performance trade-offs for hardware/software associated with these devices.  

A written response with complete technical information is requested of those suppliers who can provide working hardware ready for test and demonstration purposes.  Responses to this notice are due on or before 29 Oct 07 and shall include a complete product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability.  Other technical information that may be considered beneficial in the technical review includes but is not limited to the following:  indication of the technology readiness level or maturity of the technology, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements, and  an estimated cost for the units.   Priority for consideration will be given to small businesses.  In the event a suitable number of small businesses respond, large businesses may not be contacted for product review.

Please provide name of firm, address, POC, phone/fax number, and email address.  Submit item information to USASOC Contracting Office, ATTN: AOCO (Barbara Bowles), 1 Desert Storm Drive, Bldg. E-2929, Fort Bragg, NC, 28310.  E-mail responses are encouraged and may be provided to bowlesb@soc.mil.  Due to the intermittent nature of electronic communication, it is the vendor?s responsibility to ensure receipt.  All questions must be provided in writing.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Funds are not currently available for this requirement.

Future Acquisition Possibilities:  If it is determined that commercial capability exists and use of a tracking system is in the best interest of the Government, the Government will issue a solicitation identifying the system requirements that are found to meet the need.  It is estimated that a total of 460 individual tracking devices will be required to meet the Government?s end requirement with a possibility for some growth in quantities.

<DESC>Joint Munitions & Lethality Acquisition Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is seeking qualified sources for a SD&D effort beginning in FY09 to meet an anticipated requirement for a 105mm capability organic to the Armys Infantry Brigade Combat Teams, for 155mm and 105mm precision munitions.  The US Army is considering combining the planned 155mm precision munitions development and production program to be executed in cooperation with Sweden, to provide for both the 155mm and 105mm capabilities.  Interested sources are requested to provide a design concept(s) and planning numbers for each projectile, in terms of nonrecurring costs, time to complete development, and unit production costs.  For initial planning purposes, the contractors shall assume that two hundred (200) tactical All Up Rounds" (AURs) and two hundred (200) non- tactical rounds for other safety and performance testing for each caliber are to be delivered to the Army to complete qualification testing.  The target cost is $15,000-$20,000 per projectile at $60-100M per year for 10 years.  Key elements for this proposed effort are component commonality, reducing non- recurring engineering costs, and similar approaches for the soldier as a result of this merged concept.  In addition, qualified offerors are requested to submit the pros and cons for the concept of merging the two rounds.  A synopsis of the draft 155mm and 105mm Requirements Documents will be provided to qualified offerors upon request.  This market survey is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government.

<DESC>USAID/Colombia intends to award a Sole Source Contract modification to MSD, Inc. under Contract No. 514-C-00-06-00304-00. The estimated amount of this modification is USD$ 1,000,000. The above Contract was awarded to MSD, Inc. on a full and open competition basis on August 29, 2006, and the estimated completion date is August 28, 2011. The current total estimated contract amount is USD$ 37,768,983. The purpose of the above contract is to provide technical assistance, training and policy advice in support of human rights in Colombia. The purpose of this modification is to provide additional resources that will be applied to respond to increased interest in the human rights situation facing labor leaders.  Activities will work to strengthen the efforts of Colombian government and civil society actors to protect the human rights of labor leaders and activists as guaranteed by the Colombian Constitution.  Illustrative activities include efforts to: improve investigation and prosecution of violations of the human rights of trade union leaders and activists; strengthen and expand legal access for labor leaders and activists; provide preventive and protection measures for at-risk individuals in the labor sector; and increase public awareness about the rights of labor union members.  USAID intends to negotiate this modification with only one source under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70 (b)(5), where an award is for the continued provision of highly specialized services and award to another source would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable project delays. The required services include continuation and expansion of services of the same nature as described in the original statement of work of the original contract. This notice is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the Government?s requirement in accordance with numbered note 22.

<SUBJECT>R -- Notice Sole Source - GSA Schedule MOBIS Task Order
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) intends to negotiate a sole-source, time and materials modification to an existing GSA Schedule MOBIS Task Order with Kleimann Communications Group, Inc., 1321 Rhode Island Avenue, NW, Washington D.C. 20005 to revise the statement of work to allow the contractor to work on an alternative Good Faith Estimate (GFE), two modified HUD-1 Settlement Statements, a closing script and a closing script form, and a consolidated summary of findings from three individual consumer testing reports produced under and earlier contract for the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA).<br><br>HUD feels it would be extraordinarily inefficient to have two different contractors working on this part of the project. Information and insight sharing would be more efficient if the work were done by the same firm. HUD feels that multiple contractors splitting up the work could result in serious disharmony to the detriment of the performance of all the forms.<br><br>HUD cites only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. In accordance with: 41 USC 253(c) (1), See FAR 6.302-1). THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. Please note the intent is to award a follow on modification to the current Task Order.  The value of the modification is estimated at $360,500.

r.	Machine Stabilization Time: Fully automated
s.	Indentation Time: User-defined
t.	Tip Exchange Time: 30 seconds
u.	User Interface: Windows NT/2000/XP

Section 2: Continuous stiffness measurement specification
a.	The force application system must be capable of continuous 
force oscillation at fixed frequencies in the range of 0.5 to 300 Hz 
with force amplitudes of 0.1 to 500 uN.
b.	The software must contain a dynamic model characterizing the 
instrument's dynamic response in the frequency range of 0.1 to 2000 
Hz.
c.	The system must be capable of controlling, monitoring and 
analyzing force and displacement oscillation amplitudes as described
 in a above.
d.	The software must be capable of feedback control of the force 
oscillation to maintain a user-defined displacement amplitude 
oscillation.
e.	The software must be able to measure contact stiffness with 
displacement oscillation amplitudes as small as 1 A.
f.	The software must automatically reduce the dynamic response of
 the material to the oscillations to yield the stiffness of the contact.

Section 3: Indentation system

a.	The loading system must be electromagnetic, using a coil in a 
permanent magnetic field.  Piezo-driven loading is unacceptable due 
to its poor dynamic response (piezo drives are non-linear, hysteretic, 
and frequency-dependent).
b.	The loading and displacement system must be a linear system.  If
 the system is a rotating system, the calibration values are not 
constant and frequent calibrations are required.
c.	The loading and displacement system must be in-line or
 concentric.  Systems with off-axis loading and/or displacement 
measurements have poor load-frame stiffness and surface detection 
performance.
d.	Displacement must be measured with a capacitive plate system 
with a linear range of 100 um to insure capabilities with a wide 
variety of materials. 
e.	The loading and displacement system must be centered by a low-
stiffness leaf spring assembly.  The low stiffness assembly is required
 to determine surface contact within 1 A, which is absolutely required 
for experimentation at depths less than 100 nm.
Section 4: Data calculation
a.	The software must automatically account for thermal drift. 
b.	The software must enable the user to determine the location of 
surface contact graphically for each individual indentation.  This is
 the only way to ensure that the surface contact point has been 
determined properly.
c.	The system software must be capable of converting all data, both
 raw and calculated, to ASCII text format.
d.	The software must be capable of calculating indentation contact 
stiffness in any of three ways:  (1) Using a power law curve fitting 
routine on the unloading curve(s); (2) Using a linear fit on the 
unloading curve(s); (3) Using the dynamic response of the material in
 conjunction with the continuous stiffness measurement option.
e.	The software must be capable of accurate calculation of 
indentation contact area at depths as low as 25 nm.
f.	The software must be capable of calculating the hardness in any 
of four ways:  (1)  Use individual load/unload cycles and/or separate 
indentations to obtain contact stiffnesses from which hardness may 
be calculated; (2)  Use a single indentation, calculating hardness at 
every data point assuming total plasticity; (3)  Use a single 
indentation, calculating hardness at every data point assuming a 
constant contact-depth/total-displacement ratio, determining the ratio
 from an unloading segment at the end of the experiment; (4)  Using 
the stiffness and contact area obtained with the continuous stiffness 
measurement option.
g.	The software must be capable of calculating the elastic modulus 
in the same fashion as hardness (above).
h.	Maximum Number of Data Points must allow for at least 25,000

Section 5: Calibration
a.	The physical system constants must be calibrated independently 
of the instrument itself in a traceable manner.
b.	The loading system must be calibrated with precalibrated
 weights such that the diamond tip is not a consideration in the
 calibration.
c.	The displacement system must be calibrated using an 
independent, physically verifiable source.  Calibration of indenter 
displacement interferometrically with a laser source is the most 
accurate and verifiable manner.
d.	Calibration of all other system functions must be automatic to 
avoid errors in data calculation and system operation.
e.	Diamond tip shape calibration must be clearly defined, and the
 sample on which to perform the calibration must be provided.  
Calibration standard samples are fused silica, mounted and polished.

	
		
	4.2 Continuous Stiffness Measurement option 	
	
	The system must have Continuous Stiffness Measurement 
	(CSM) technique.  CSM enables the system to measure stiffness 
	of contact throughout the experiment, thus a single indent can 
	yield hardness and modulus as a function of penetration depth 
	without unloading the indenter.  Must enable effective strain rate 
	control of the tests.  This option must include the following 
	features:
	
a.	Continuous force oscillation, frequencies 0.05 to 200 Hz
b.	Force amplitudes of 60 nN to 300 mN
c.	Software with dynamic model characterizing the instrument's 
dynamic response in the frequency range of 0.05 to 2000 Hz
d.	System controls, monitors and analyzes force and displacement 
oscillation amplitudes as described above
e.	Feedback control of the force oscillation to maintain a user-
defined displacement amplitude oscillation.
f.	Able to measure contact stiffness with displacement oscillation 
amplitudes as small as 1 A
g.	Automatic reduction of dynamic response of the material to the
 oscillations to yield the stiffness of the contact
	
	4.3 Optical Imaging System for the Indenter	
	
	The optical imaging system for the indenter must include a CCD 
	camera and all required cables to bring high resolution to the 
	video microscope image on the computer screen displayed with
	the indenter system software.
	Separate video display software is unacceptable. The image must
	be displayed and interacted with the indenter software for not
	only real-time display, but also real time test setup and indenter 
	targeting.  	

4.4 Other General Requirements:

Indentation system
a.	The loading system must be electromagnetic, using a coil in a permanent 
	magnetic field.  Piezo-driven loading is unacceptable due to its poor dynamic 
	response (piezo drives are non-linear, hysteretic, and frequency-dependent).
b.	The loading and displacement system must be a linear system.  If the system is a 
	rotating system, the calibration values are not constant and frequent calibrations 
	are required.
c.	The loading and displacement system must be in-line or concentric.  Systems with 
	off-axis loading and/or displacement measurements have poor load-frame 
	stiffness and surface detection performance.
d.	Displacement must be measured with a capacitive plate system with a linear range 
	of 100 um to insure capabilities with a wide variety of materials. 
e.	The loading and displacement system must be centered by a low-stiffness leaf 
	spring assembly.  The low stiffness assembly is required to determine surface 
	contact within 1 A which is absolutely required for experimentation at depths less 
	than 100 nm.
g.	The software must be capable of calculating the elastic modulus in the same 
	fashion as hardness (above).
h.   Must be ISO 14577 compatible with temperature measurement
i.    Must have integrated piezo motion stage for 100 x 100 micron motion repeatable to

i.3 X & Y reproducibility	less than/equal to 2nm
i.4 X & Y linearity	less than/equal to 0.02%
i.5 Z resolution	<0.01nm
i.6 X-Y position accuracy	2nm
i.7 X & Y feedback control in closed loop

     j.    Software capability must allow for variation of the data recording rate

Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 



Closing date and time for receipt of offers is October 30, 2007, 3:00 p.m., EST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.  Anticipated award date is on or about October 31, 2007. Contact David W. Allen at David.W.Allen@uscg.mil or 252-335-6494 for questions regarding this solicitation.  Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5240, or at the following address:

         (a) Prohibitions. 
          Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
         (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
         Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
         Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
         Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 
         (1)     The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
         (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 
         (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
         (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
         (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
         Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
         (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
         (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
         (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
         (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
         (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
         (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
         (d) Special rule for related partnerships.     For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
         (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
         (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
         (i) Warrants; 
         (ii) Options; 
         (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
         (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
         (v) Others similar interests. 
         (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to revise Section "Description" of the original Solicitation and publish questions and answers relative to this Solicitation.

Specifically, the Solicitation is amended as follows:

1.  The section entitled "Description" is hereby replaced with the following:

"Description:  

The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), 875 Fifteenth Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20005, intends to acquire medical evacuation services and medical assistance services for its personnel traveling and living abroad.  The purpose of this Statement of Work is to obtain emergency medical assistance services 24 hours/7 days a week when the traveler and/or eligible family member is 100 or miles away from their permanent residence on official travel or a permanent assignment.  The following is a sampling of the countries in which travel may occur:

Armenia, Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Dominican Republic, East Timor, Ecuador, Georgia, Ghana, Honduras, Jordan, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mali, Moldova, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Ukraine, United States, Vanuatu.

A medical emergency is defined as physical, mental and/or natal.  

All MCC employees and their eligible family members traveling on official temporary duty orders or official permanent assignment orders are under the direct jurisdiction of the U.S. Ambassador.  As such, the U.S. Embassy serves as the first point of contact in most emergency situations.  If a traveler is injured, becomes ill or is deemed mentally unstable and adequate medical care is not available, the selected contractor will work in tandem with the U.S. Embassy medical staff, when such staff is available.  Final decisions on medical evacuations for MCC employees and eligible family members are to be made in joint consultation between the contractor, the U.S. Embassy medical staff and if possible the injured party or his/her guardian.

The following services are not required but are HIGHLY DESIRABLE:
The countries to which MCC permanently assigns its employees are considered inadequate for safe births.  All pregnant personnel must be medically evacuated for a period of three months - six weeks prior to and six weeks post birth.   The medical evacuation includes the pregnant female and minor children that the spouse remaining in country is unable to care for."

2.  The MCC received five questions about this Solicitation.  The questions and the MCC's responses are provided below.

Question 1:  Is there currently a program in place and if so, do you have the utilization statistics?
Answer 1:  Please see the answer to Question 4 for more information regarding current program.  Also, MCC intends to increase the number of participants by adding eligible family members.  See the section entitled "Estimate Population Covered" of the Solicitation for more detail information.

Question 2:  The Solicitation states that the Contractor would work in coordination with the U.S. Embassy staff to determine if a medical evacuation is necessary.  If it is determined that the evacuation is necessary, is the Contractor expected to just make arrangements or make arrangements and provide funding for the evacuation?
Answer 2:  All evacuation costs shall be covered by the Contractor.  Please also see revised section entitled "Description", above.

Question 3:  Please provide bidders list.
Answer 3:  A bidders list does not exist for this requirement.

Question 4:  What are main differences between old Statement of Work and the current one or the old contract number, title, award date of when this project was last performed/managed?  What is the name of the person (incumbent) or entity currently performing the contract/project?
Answer 4:  MCC has current contract with the Medex Assistance.  The contract number is MCC-05-0002-CFO and the title is "Medical Assistance Services".  The award date is November 1, 2004.
Main differences between old Statement of Work and the current one are:
- Including eligible family members;
- Specifically citing mental illness as a justification for medical evacuation;
- Requiring Contractor to work with the U.S. Embassy when there is a U.S. Embassy; and
- Requesting for medical evacuation for maternity purposes.

Question 5:  Due to the public benefit of these requests, etc. we know that Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is not required here.  However, if you do, please provide us answers which you think are NOT covered by FOIA and also give us e-mail, fax number of the FOIA office on this project.
Answer 5:  Answers have been provided for all questions.


All other terms and conditions of the original Solicitation MCC-08-0014-RFQ-79 remains in full force and effect.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR HOTEL AND CONFERENCE FACILITIES FOR SPACE FLIGHT AWARENESS PROGRAM STS-122 EVENT.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to address the Questions/Answers from prospective offerors in response to this Combined Synopsis: Question 1:  Our hotel would like to bid on this program, but we are unfortunately unfamiliar with the ins and outs of site.  Would you be able to provide me a little guidance regarding how we are to navigate and reply to requests on the online response system? Answer 1:  There is no requirement for online response for this effort.  Interested parties may provide an offer via e-mail or fax to the point of contact(s) listed in the solicitation.  In responding, be sure to provide the required information, including representation and certifications.  Offerors are encouraged to confirm receipt of the offer by the Government by contacting the contract specialist, Kirby Condron, at 281-483-4193.   Question 2:  I am not a hotel or conference facility, but I am a meeting planner who would love to assist with the site selection for the program. My company is always happy to relieve clients of the time-consuming task of locating and contracting the appropriate hotel properties for their programs. Our site selection and contract negotiation services are complimentary as we are compensated by a placement fee from the property based on your sleeping rooms. Answer 2:  Thank you for your offer of assistance in selection of the hotel for the SFA program.  However, this solicitation is not for an independent party to evaluate and select a facility for the SFA program to have their event.  The purpose of the solicitation is for the SFA program team to make the selection of a hotel and conference facility for the STS-122 event.  All offerors who feel they can support this requirement are welcome to provide a proposal in response to this solicitation.  Please note, if you are an event planner or an independent party providing an offer, provide a copy of the signed written agreement between you and your selected hotel guaranteeing the reserved block of rooms, room rate, facilities, amenities and catering services to be provided for the event.  As a reminder, payment of the rooms will be made directly to the hotel by event attendees and will not be covered by a government issued purchase order. Question 3:  Just wanted to quickly check in with you and see if there is anything that we could assist you with for the upcoming Space Flight Awareness (SFA) Program STS-122 Event in the area of awards, promotional products, employee gifts, etc?  We are a promotional premiums company specializing in screen printing and embroidery of apparel items, as well as offering any promotional product you could think of. We feature a web site with full-color catalogs, which is a great place to go to for creative ideas or promotional product solutions for projects you might be working on.  Answer 3:  Thank you for your offer of assistance in selection of the hotel for the SFA program; however, this solicitation is solely for the selection of hotel and conference facilities. The due date for receipt of offers, 10/17/2007, is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 10/04/2007.  Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.
