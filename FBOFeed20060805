<DESC>The Agency of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), through the Division of Acquisition Management (DAM), Program Support Center (PSC), intends to award a 20 month sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to The University of Florida, Louis de la Parte Florida Mental Health Institute, The National Implementation Research Network, MHC2420 13301 Bruce B. Downs Blvd., Tampa, Florida 33612.  The anticipated date of award is
August 28, 2006.

The purpose of this contract is to provide technical assistance support for grantees within the Older Adults Mental Health TCE program. As a first goal, this contract shall support generic training in the knowledge base for mental health implementation science to all the 11 TCE sites.

The TCE sites will be convened in a second annual grantee meeting during the spring of 2007. Meeting logistics such as hotel, meeting rooms, audio visual needs, are paid for by
SAMSHA under a logistics contract, while grantees pay for their own travel of 3-4 persons from each site (this includes the project director, a project manager or coordinator, clinical person and evaluator).  The place of this meeting has not yet been determined but is likely to be in a destination in the Mountain Time zone to best accommodate travelers representing all time zones. For the first training goal for all 11 sites, a group-level training event in implementation science and the real world lessons learned in transmitting new programs
to existing provider settings would best be conducted as a half day workshop at this two day annual TCE grantee meeting. Prior to, and as follow-up to this in-person meeting, a series of training and interactive conference calls with all the sites is needed to identify specific problems and issues and to provide appropriate didactic materials and more focused responses to issues raised by sites.

As a second goal, for a subset of four (4) sites identified by the program’s GPO as experiencing particularly challenging implementation problems, this contract shall support site visits, and one-on-one in depth technical assistance to these four sites to resolve issues and to redirect the grantees activities in ways that will result in more productive and effective projects. It is estimated that four sites will be in need of this more individual attention over the remainder of the project period.

The more intensive, site-level consultation needed for four sites will take place across a period of about 12-15 months. The sites that are most in need of this consultation and the
specific needs and approaches toward addressing these needs in consultation will be worked out with the program GPO in a series of planning calls and a plan will be developed.

A third goal of this contract is to provide the GPO with a final report about the activities of the consultation and training, with sites, and to identify and recommend a training and
consultation approach that could be used by other entities trying to assist providers with service implementation needs.

In summary this contract shall contribute to facilitating the implementation goals of the Older Adult TCE program during the last two years of its operation by accomplishing three specific objectives:

In collaboration with the program GPO, through reading site materials, and in conference calls with the sites, the contractor shall learn about the problems and issues facing the 11 sites in their efforts to implement evidence-based mental health practices for older adults.  A plan will be developed and implemented for providing training to all sites through conference calls, materials dissemination, and an in person at the 2007 annual TCE grantee meeting in the format of a half-day workshop. Group conference calls with grantees will be conducted to provide the contractor with orientation to problems and for the contractor to provide regular follow-up to the training workshop to sites through the remainder of the program.

In collaboration with the program GPO, the contractor shall assess which four sites in the TCE program are having the most difficulty and that could benefit from more individual
consultation. Four sites will be chosen for more directed technical assistance, and more information will be gathered from these sites, site visits will be planned and conducted, and
training and support will follow from this assessment. The contractor will consult regularly with the GPO on strategy and progress for the consultations.

A final report will be provided to the GPO summarizing the activities and learning from the cross-program training as well as the individual site consultations. A report format will be developed in collaboration with the GPO.

The contractor shall convene planning meeting via teleconference within 30 days of award of contract; develop plan for approach and implementation for cross-site training to all 11 grantee sites in the TCE program in the major principles of mental health implementation science and practice; fully implement plan and document activities for conducting cross-site training through conference calls and at in person training workshop at TCE grantee meeting within 10 months of award of contract.  Beginning in month 4, provide 4 quarterly progress reports to GPO until 16 month of contract.  Consult with GPO to determine a subset of four TCE sites that will need more in-depth consultation to resolve implementation barriers.  Develop strategy for consultation, a site-visit protocol, and implement the in-depth consultations and sites visits with four of the TCE sites. Provide report to GPO of findings and recommendations from the site visits and consultations with each of these four sites through the quarterly reports and in the final report. These consultation activities should be initiated within five months of the beginning of the contract and completed by month 19 of the contract.  Submit Draft Final Report, including summary of all project activities, learnings and recommendations, to GPO 4 weeks before end of contract.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source Under authority of far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

GS-07P-06-UEC-0059, Project No. NTX00162   

This modification incorporates the minutes from the Pre-Proposal Conference held in Austin, TX on July 27, 2006.

Pre-Proposal Conference
Meeting Minutes
New U.S. Courthouse
Austin, TX
Solicitation No. GS-07P-06-UEC-0059
July 27, 2006

A list of attendees will be provided by e-mail upon request to Ms. Byrd at her 
e-mail address of lisa.byrd@gsa.gov 

Lisa Byrd, the GSA Contracting Officer (CO), opened the conference at 1:30p.m.  She introduced herself, Dale Sherman (GSA Project Manager) and Dal Latsha, (CO in the GSA Austin office).  She informed the group the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the procurement process for the selection of the CMc Contractor and to briefly discuss the current status of the project design.

Ms. Byrd described the best value source selection procurement method that will be used to select a contractor for this project.  She emphasized technical expertise and past performance will be the most important evaluation factors, but price will also be considered.  The contract will be a firm, fixed-price award for Design Phase Services, with an Option for the Construction Phase Services.  She also stressed the importance of ensuring all references provided by the offerors should have current telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers) and e-mail addresses, as the evaluation board does not have time to repeatedly attempt to reach these references.  

Ms. Byrd stated the proposal due date and time is August 11, 2006, no later than 3:30p.m. CST.  The Government may choose not to answer any questions after August 4, 2006, in order to incorporate all answers in an amendment in time for offerors to include this information in their proposal.  All questions must be submitted in writing, via e-mail, to the attention of Ms. Byrd.  

Ms. Byrd stressed the importance of checking the FedBizOps website on a daily basis, as this is the only source of information about the project.  All amendments will be posted to this website.  Ms. Byrd informed the group the website address is www.fedbizopps.gov  If anyone has any questions about accessing this website, please call Ms. Byrd at 817/978-2714 or send an e-mail to her attention at lisa.byrd@gsa.gov   

Ms. Byrd asked everyone to introduce themselves.  This was done.  The floor was then opened to questions.

Q – question
A – answer

 
Q – when will the Oral Presentations be held for those firms that make the short list? 
A – that date hasn’t been established.  Tentative dates are August 24th and 25th  and August 28th and 29th.  The presentations will be held in Ft. Worth in the Federal Building.  Presentation dates will be established after the proposals are received on August 11, 2006.  All offerors who make the short list will be notified ASAP about the date of the Oral Presentations.

Q – any consideration given to extending the proposal due date of 8/11/06?
A – no, because we really need to get the CMc on board as quickly as possible.

Q – what are the three (3) innovative LEED points referenced in the RFP?
A – they are as follows:  1)  Education and Demonstration Features; 2)  Make Up Air Units on Roof and 3)  Chemical Free Termite Control

Q – how will the Government handle any discrepancies between the cost estimates prepared by the design A/E and those cost estimates prepared by the CMc?  
A – the design A/E team will not proceed to the next design phase until the cost estimates are reconciled to an amount that is considered (by the Government) to be close enough to be “workable”.  All team members will verify unit costs and quantities to ensure these items are reconciled.  The Government will also use a third party cost estimating firm to help with the reconciliation process.

Q – the CMc is usually required to attend certain meetings during the Design Phase.   How should we prepare our proposal when we don’t know the number of trips and/or the location of the meetings that will be required?
A – any trips the CMc is required to make outside of those specifically identified in the RFP will be negotiated and added to the contract via a modification to the contract. 

Q – is the Qualify Control Plan included in the 100 (50 pages back-to-back) page limitation?
A – no, it is considered an attachment.

Q – what type pricing information are we to submit on the price proposal page for the Construction Phase?  We really have no idea what construction costs will be in two or three years.
A – construction is currently planned to begin in the Spring of 2009.  GSA may receive funding in 2008, but most likely will not.  For the purposes of preparing your price proposal for the Construction Phase Services, keep in mind what we are looking for, at this stage, is your understanding of the cost range of $50-60M and the Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) concept.  The actual GMP proposal will not be submitted by the firm selected for this contract until after the design phase has been completed.   

 
Q – does the $50-60M range include the fee for the Design Phase Services?
A – no.

Q – how do we take into account what construction costs may be in 2009?  
A – the Government does allow an escalation rate for construction projects that are not awarded within a few months of design completion.  This escalation rate varies and is not known at this time.  **For proposal purposes, offerors should use their best judgment.

Q – please explain the difference between the type information you want for Past Performance and what you want for Experience.
A – Past Performance describes the firm’s performance on similar projects (completed within the past eight (8) years.)  How the firm complied with the contract schedule, budget and quality requirements; how the firm dealt with problems during the project and what corrective actions they took to resolve these problems; how the firm’s performance on other projects is similar to the performance required on this project.  References are required describing the firm’s performance on past projects.  Experience – a description of your firm’s experience in providing value engineering, design oversight and independent cost estimating services.  What experience does your firm have in providing design phase and construction phase services on similar projects?

Q – may we use the same project to describe both Past Performance and Experience?  If so, do we have to provide all the same information for both evaluation factors, or can we just reference the project already described?
A – you may reference the same project already described, as long as you provide all the information required for both evaluation criteria, as described 
in the RFP.     

Q – are bonds required for the Design Phase Services?
A – no, just for the Construction Phase Services.

Q – where is Attachment #1 referenced in Volume 1, Paragraph 2.16 Commissioning Requirements? 
A – reference to this Attachment #1 is deleted in its entirety.  There is no Attachment #1 for the CMc contractor.  The required commissioning services will be provided by an independent commissioning agent hired by the Government under separate contract.

Q – will the Government hire a Construction Management (CM) firm for the Construction Phase?
A – yes, a CM firm will be hired to act as the Government’s on-site representative during construction.  This firm will be responsible for the day-to-day oversight of the project.  

Ms. Byrd told the assembled group the RFP includes a statement a site visit will be offered after the Pre-Proposal Conference.  She explained the site is secured by a locked fence and she would need to get a key to the site to provide access.  If anyone was interested in a site visit, the GSA team would provide access, but it would be limited to the site – the offerors could not walk inside the structure on the site, for safety reasons.  Ms. Byrd suggested the contractors could drive around the site and gain as much information.  No one accepted the offer for a site visit, so the meeting was adjourned.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Purchase Order to Dantec Dynamics, Inc.
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-06-836-5301
<RESPDATE>081206

<CONTACT>Joseph Widdup, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 975-6324, Fax (301) 975-8884, Email joseph.widdup@nist.gov
<DESC>NIST has a requirement for purchase of a 1D FiberFlow LDA Upgrade.  A background and summary of the requirements are as follows:

A laser Doppler anemometer (LDA) crosses two beams of collimated, monochromatic laser light in the flow of the fluid being measured. A microscopic pattern of bright and dark stripes forms in the intersection volume. Small particles in the flow pass through this pattern and reflect light towards a detector, with a characteristic frequency indicating, via the Doppler effect, the velocity of the particle passing through the sensing volume. The Burst Spectrum Analyzer (BSA) processes the reflected laser light and calculates the velocity of the particles, essentially equal to the velocity of the air moving in our wind tunnel at velocities between 0.15 m/s and 40 m/s.
	
The BSA hardware and software components must be fully compatible with the existing Dantec Dynamics laser Doppler anemometer system used in the NIST Airspeed Calibration Service. The existing LDA system is comprised of: a Spectra Physics Stabilite 2016 laser, a Dantec 57 N 10 BSA, a Dantec 6 x 40 transmitter, and a Dantec 2D probe 60 x 11. 
	
The upgraded system shall be integrated to the existing data acquisition software platform.  More specifically, the system should be able to send online, one-component average velocity information every 100 ms, to be received and processed by LabVIEW via a digital interface such as IEEE 488 or RS 232.  The system should consist of one BSA flow processor, one upgrade to the latest version of BSA Flow software to measure velocity and one software driver that enables the online average data transfer between the processor and the existing LabVIEW data acquisition platform.  Installation, demonstration of functionality, and training of the system upgrade must be provided by the Contractor at NIST.
	
SIGNAL PROCESSOR REQUIREMENTS
	
The signal processor shall meet the following minimum specifications:

Accuracy of 0.1% with a 16-bit resolution of measured Doppler frequency (velocity)

Multi-bit digitization of the input Doppler burst.

Have several hundred selections per bandwidth to enable optimization of the velocity range to be measured.

Maximum Doppler frequency 100 MHz.

Maximum 30 MHz bandwidth

Minimum Doppler frequency 0.28 Hz

Minimum 15 kHz bandwidth

Transit time down to 30 nS
	
SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

Provide on-line real-time system monitor of Doppler signals from photomultiplier

Bandwidth settings in terms of velocity ranges m/s or ft/s (not Doppler frequency)

Online monitoring of data rate and validity of signal.

The software shall allow the online average data transmission from the processor to the existing LabVIEW data acquisition platform.

Based on extensive market research conducted by NIST, NIST has only been able to identify one potential source that appears capable of providing the required items that meet the minimum requirements and compatibility constraints noted above: Dantec Dynamics, Inc. The contract line item numbers (CLINs) intended to be procured from Dantec Dynamics, Inc. to satisfy this requirement include the following:

CLIN 0001: Code 62N40 - BSA F60 Flow Processor.  100 Mhz maximum frequency. On-line burst monitor.  Works directly in m/s or ft/s.  Can be used with WiFi networks; Quantity: 1; Unit: Each.

CLIN 0002: Code 57S70; BSA Flow Software. Software Update Agreement for 62N processors.  Upgrade to new software versions for a period of 12 months.  One or more releases per year downloadable from the web; Quantity: 1; Unit: Each.

CLIN 0003: Item 62N550 - BSA Link ActiveX Driver option for BSA F processors; Quantity: 1; Unit: Each.

CLIN 0004: Equipment installation and training at customer site; Quantity: 1; Unit: Job.

The above system will replace and upgraDe the burst spectrum analyzer in the present NIST Laser Doppler Anemometer system; that system is manufactured by Dantec, and it must be replaced with a compatible instrument and attendant software.  

NIST intends to award a sole source purchase order to Dantec Dynamics, Inc. under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) to procure the above CLINs unless other responsible sources identify themselves to joseph.widdup@nist.gov on or before the response date for this posting and clearly and unequivocally demonstrate their capability to satisfy the technical requirements noted above.  The Government will determine, based on written responses received in response to this posted notice, whether this procurement will be competed.
