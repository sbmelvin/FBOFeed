<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to support program development, implementation and achievement of USAID/Jamaica’s Economic Growth Strategic Objective (SO) of Increased Trade Competitiveness in Targeted Industries (SO 9).  To achieve the Economic Growth Strategic Objective, two Intermediate Results (IRs) have been identified, specifically IR 1: Competitive Clusters Developed and IR 2: Business Environment Improved.  These two results will be accomplished through the design and implementation of activities that will stimulate economic growth, maximize Jamaica’s benefits from bilateral, regional and international trade agreements and position target industries and firms to take maximum advantage of opportunities created as a result of these agreements and other sustainable development opportunities.  USAID/Jamaica-Caribbean seeks to procure the services of a qualified firm or an effective consortium of firms to focus efforts on reducing and eliminating impediments to economic growth, competitiveness and investment and on developing competitive industry clusters and firms that have the capacity to compete in an increasingly more competitive global economy.
  
Program implementation is expected to be carried out through the provision of short-term and long-term technical assistance, training, local capacity building, private sector partnership development, public-private alliance creation, grants under contract, public information campaigns/outreach, limited commodity procurement, and other related services.  The related economic growth strategy is a component of the broader USAID/Jamaica FY2005-FY2009 sustainable development strategy to be a catalyst for Transformational Change to Accelerate Sustainable and Equitable Economic Growth in a More Competitive World.  The program will engage a collaborative approach to economic development by mobilizing public and quasi-public institutions, the private sector, supporting non-governmental organizations (NGOs), other donors, the Jamaican Diaspora and targeted urban and rural communities throughout Jamaica to support demand driven activities that contribute to sustainable and equitable economic growth, the elimination of barriers to competitive global trade and investment, increased competitiveness of the private sector, improved quality of the labor force, and the capacity to take greatest advantage of opportunities created by the Caribbean Single Market & Economy (CSME), the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), the World Trade Organization (WTO), other Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and by hosting key Cricket World Cup 2007 events.

The technical papers shall be limited to 15 pages, single-spaced, 1-inch margins, double-sided, 8.5 by 11-inch pages.  Select an easy to read font no smaller than 12 pitch fixed or proportional font size 10 or larger.  Smaller type may be used in figures and tables as long as it is clearly legible.  The Government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation.  Multiple technical papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror.  The purpose of the technical paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Those technical papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submission.  The Government reserves the right to enter negotiations on any, all, part, or none of the papers received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds.  The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offerors proposal to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement.    The proposals will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are listed in descending order of importance:  (1) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal,  (2) Importance to Space Control Technology programs, and (3) Affordability.  Price, in the context of affordability of proposals versus availability of funds, will be a substantial consideration in selecting proposals for awards, but will be secondary to technical considerations. Price will be evaluated and negotiated on proposals selected for award.  No further evaluation criteria will be used. Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA.  Principle funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY06.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to a foreign disclosure review.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, SMC/SYK, Los Angeles AFB, CA:  Capt. Mia Kinsey, phone (310) 416-1728, email mia.kinsey@losangeles.af.mil or information if they contemplate responding. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. The work to be performed may require a TOP SECRET/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability, therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET/SCI information at time of award. BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition. The Ombudsman is Director of Staff, SMC/DS, phone number (310) 363-3571.  Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the contracting manager, Capt. Mia Kinsey (310) 416-1728.  This BAA will remain open for 12 months from the date of publication or until replaced by a successor BAA, whichever is first.  There is no guarantee that awards will be made in each of the identified technical areas.  The Government may make multiple awards in a technical area depending, in part, on the cost of individual proposals and the available funding.  While technical papers will be accepted at any time during the fiscal year, proposals received later in the fiscal year have a greater risk of not being funded due to unavailability of funds.  Proposers are cautioned that only contracting officers are legally authorized to bind the government.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Security and Safety Performance Assurance (SSA), intends to award a sole source bridge contract for a period up to 12 months (including base period plus option periods) for Protective Force services in the National Capital Area for DOE.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1 (a) which authorizes other than full and open competition  when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The bridge is required pending completion of a competitive follow-on acquisition.  The present contract with Worldwide Security Services, Ltd. (WSS) will end on July 31, 2005.  No other firm has the requisite knowledge and experience that can assume the highly specialized protective force support without interruption on August 1, 2005.  WSS has the requisite number of key and non-key personnel possessing the required security clearances.  This unique working environment necessitates the award of a sole source â€œbridgeâ€ to the incumbent contractor, WSS.  The follow on procurement action will be a competitive small business set-aside.  The intent of this sole source procurement is to provide the required support services from August 1, 2005 until the completion of the follow-on acquisition.  Note 22 apply.

The goals of this project is to develop methods and models using directional distance functions which incorporate bycatch in capacity estimates; to extend those methods to value bycatch; and to apply the models to a fishery in the northeast region.  The contractor shall propose methods and models on how to incorporate bycatch in vessel capacity estimates, and how to properly value bycatch given the models chosen.  This is to be accomplished by reviewing literature including examples from the fisheries.  Methods should be applicable to differing assumptions regarding scale of the technology such as variable, constant or non-decreasing returns to scale.  The contractor shall perform a case study, working in close association with personnel at the Northeast Fisheries Science Center, and apply the models and methods to a selected fleet operating in the Northeast Large Marine Ecosystem (LME).  The contractor shall provide a final report, which includes the literature review, details of the methods and models developed and results from the case study.  The report should include details on extending the methods to different fleets in the regions, and statistical methods which would allow one to scale up the estimates to cover all vessels in a given fleet.  The period of performance shall be 14 months after contract award.  Based on his expertise and previous experience measuring capacity for the National Marine Fisheries Service, and in order to obtain consistency with methods which have been previously adopted for measuring fishing capacity it is necessary to negotiate with Dr. Kirkley.

<SOLNBR>GS-02P-05-DTC-0021(N)
<RESPDATE>072805
<CONTACT>Joan Ryan, Supv. Contract Spec., Phone (212) 264-7469, Fax (212) 264-0588, Email joan.ryan@gsa.gov - Winnie Eng, Contract Specialist, Phone 212-264-2575, Fax 212-264-0588, Email winnie.eng@gsa.gov
<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Northeast and Caribbean Region is pleased to announce an opportunity for Construction Excellence for the Infrastructure Upgrade of the Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse located at 40 Centre Street, New York, NY.  GSA is seeking a Construction Management firm as Constructor and/or a General Contractor to perform both PreConstruction and Construction Services for this project.  The project will involve three phases of construction including Phase I: Selective Bulk Demolition and Hazardous Material Abatement, Phase II: Exterior Closure Repairs and, Phase III: Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing (MEP) and Interior construction work.  This project is being designed by the firm of Beyer Blinder Belle, Architects and Planners of NYC.

The Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse was designed by Cass Gilbert and opened in 1936.  The courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and as a New York City Landmark. The 718,180 gross square foot building is located in the Civic Center of Lower Manhattan near the entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge. The courthouse houses approximately 600 federal employees who work for both the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  This courthouse consists of a 6-story base a 26-story tower, which includes two mechanical floors at the top of the tower and one in the basement.  The courthouse contains twenty-three courtrooms, forty-four judges chambers and court-related office spaces.  GSA and the US Courts have jointly agreed to vacate the courthouse in order to perform a single infrastructure upgrade project consisting of three phases. 

Through the Construction Excellence program, GSA will employ the best practices that will result in the best project for the best value; procure the highest quality construction services as early as practical; and establish reliable budgets and the ability to manage them. 

The scope of services for this project will consist of preconstruction services including, but not limited to; estimating, scheduling, value engineering, constructability, drawing completeness and coordination reviews.  Optional services will include construction of the project.  Option No. 1 will include Phase I & II, and is anticipated to be awarded in December of 2006; and Option No. 2 will include Phase III and is anticipated to be awarded in January of 2008.  

The Overall Estimated Construction Cost Range for this project is $145,000,000 to $152,000,000, and is broken out for each phase of construction as follows:  Phase I:  Selective Bulk Demolition and Hazmat Abatement: $ 5,000,000 - $6,000,000;  Phase II: Exterior Closure Repairs: $ 20,000,000 - $23,000,000; and Phase III: MEP/Interior Construction Work: $ 120,000,000 - $123,000,000.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on June 29, 2005.  GSA will be holding a PreProposal conference for the Stage 1 submissions.  The date and time for this conference will be issued under a separate announcement. If you would like a copy of the Request for Proposal, please contact Ms. Joan Ryan, Contracting Officer at 212-264-7469 or email joan.ryan@gsa.gov, or Ms. Winnie Eng, Contract Specialist at 212-264-2575 or email winnie.eng@gsa.gov.

The procurement process will be performed in two (2) Stages. The procurement method that will be implemented for this project will be in accordance with FAR Part 15.1 - Source Selection Processes and Techniques. This will be a competitive acquisition, utilizing the Tradeoff process approach under the Best Value Continuum (FAR 15.101).  This process permits tradeoffs among cost or price and technical factors and allows the government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal, if feasible. 

Stage 1 submission:  During this stage, GSA will issue a Request for Proposal for a technical and price submission. The technical proposal submission will include the offerors’s response to the following technical evaluation factors (Total of 100 points):  1) Offeror’s Experience on Similar Projects (35 points); A more favorable evaluation will be given to offeror’s who demonstrate their experience, history and understanding of the New York City construction market; 2)  Offeror’s Past Performance on Similar Projects (35 points); and 3) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel (30 points).  The price proposal submission will include a Guaranteed 
Maximum price (GMP) for each phase of construction.  The GMP under Stage 1 shall not exceed the ranges as stated herein and in the RFP for each phase of construction.  

Based on the evaluation of each proposal, a competitive range will be established in accordance with FAR 15.306(c)(1).  Then, in accordance with FAR 15.306(c)(2), based on the results of the evaluation, the Contracting Officer will limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated offerors.  For this procurement, the competition will be limited to the three (3) most highly rated offerors.  Based on the complexity and importance of this project, the Government deems it to be in its best interest to make an award to the Contractor offering the best value to the government.  Therefore, for this procurement the Technical Evaluation Factors when combined will be more important than cost or price, alone. 

The three most highly rated offerors found to be within the competitive range will EACH be issued a stipend in the amount of $70,000.00 and will proceed into Stage 2 of the procurement process.  The stipend will be paid to each offeror for their total effort related to the services rendered during Stage 2.

Stage 2 submission:  Stage II of the procurement process will progress as the Architect-Engineer designs the three construction document packages as described above.   

Those firms found to be within the competitive range will assist the GSA with the A-E’s Design by performing the review and evaluation of the design and construction documents.  The offerors will be required to work with the GSA in a cooperative team effort to develop a quality design which is within budget.  Each offeror will be required to notify GSA of all issues regarding design submissions that appear inadequate and which may have the potential to jeopardize the project's goals relating to Schedule, Cost, Quality or Scope.   

The Stage 2 submission will include a Technical and Price proposal.  The Stage 2 technical proposal will include the following technical evaluation factors (Total 100 points):  4) Construction Document Review and Written Comments (30 points); 5) Detailed Project Management and Technical Approach (30 points); and 6) Construction Process/Management Presentation (40 points).   The Stage 2 price proposal will include a firm-fixed price for Selective Bulk Demolition and Hazardous Material Abatement, a firm-fixed price for the Exterior Closure Repairs; and a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) for the MEP/Interior construction work.   

The offeror’s principal tasks during Stage II of the procurement process will include the following:  reviewing and evaluating the designs for completeness, constructability and logistics, preparing cost estimates to ensure that the project is within the GMP, reconciling those estimates with the GSA’s estimates, preparing cost estimates for potential alternates to assist budget issues, preparing construction schedules, and resolution of potential design and construction issues. The offerors will address these tasks in written comments for each set of documents issued by the GSA.  If costs are over budget, the offeror’s will actively participate in efforts to reduce costs. 

Upon successful completion and evaluation of Stage II, a contract will be awarded to one selected offeror, who was found to offer the best overall value to the government.  The Base Contract Services will be issued for $120,000 and will include Construction Document Review Services for the completion of all MEP/Interiors Construction Documents. The selected Construction Manager and/or General Contractor  will then participate as a member of the team for the Preconstruction Services, including, construction document review services for the completion of all MEP and Interiors Construction Documents.   

If GSA determines that the construction option prices are within the available funding, GSA will exercise the options for the construction of the project and issue Notice to Proceed.   Exercise of any Option by the GSA is contingent upon the availability of funds.

Stage 1 submissions (technical and price proposals) will be due by 1:30 p.m., July 28, 2005.  The RFP will include all the submission requirements.  This procurement is being issued under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, and will be open to both small and large business concerns.  Before award of the contract, the firm (if not a small business of $28,5000,000 gross average sales/receipts for the past three years) shall be required to present an acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507.  

As part of its commitment to socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government, the General Services Administration will establish subcontracting goals for Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Women-Owned Small Business, Hubzone Small Business, and Service Disabled Veteran - Owned Small Business concerns.  In support of the agency’s effort, firms seeking consideration for this contract shall demonstrate a proactive effort in achieving these goals, and will place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with the small business categories listed above.  GSA anticipates hosting a Subcontracting Opportunities Networking session following the PreProposal conference.  The Networking session is intended to affirm GSA’s recognition of the talent that exists in the small business community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between the community and the firms which are considering submitting proposals on this project.   This information will also be issued under a separate announcement shortly.  AWARD OF THIS CONTRACT WILL BE CONTINGENT UPON AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.

The contract objective is to provide up to three additional XLB prototype units to enable parallel development and testing in order to accelerate the overall project schedule thus allowing TSA to enter into pilot testing and potentially full system deployment in a much shorter amount of time.  

The TSA intends to negotiate a single-source contract to provide three (3) additional prototypes that are identical to two (2) prototypes undergoing research and development in order to accelerate the Phoenix Phase III testing schedule. To successfully conduct parallel testing, it is essential that all prototypes units be alike.  The Analogic XLB Phoenix effort was awarded as a part of the overall Phoenix Project initiative, which was a full and open competition.

The TSA anticipates a twelve (12) month period of performance, with an expected contract award date of August 2005.

FAR Clauses:  52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.  You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicitatio! n will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete, and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help you g! ather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a five-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract on a sole source basis to EDO Marine and Aircraft Systems,  North Amityville, New York 11701-4840.   This IDIQ contract includes a variety of engineering services for the repair and conversion of the MK 105, Organic Airborne and Surface Influence Sweep (OASIS), and the Precise Navigation System (PNS).  The use of task orders will provide the flexibility necessary for the different types of work required.  Under this IDIQ EDO will provide for repair, modification and overhaul of the MK 105, OASIS and PNS systems.  This includes all depot repairs and incorporation of Engineering Change Proposals (ECP), including the generation of all Integrated Logistics Support documentation to support the conversions.  This effort is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. a)	EDO is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and the only source for the three systems listed above.  As such, only EDO has the expertise, technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel to successfully complete the system overhauls and supporting documentation as well as the other tasking specified above. EDO has been the sole developer of the OASIS system including the award of the Systems Design and Development (SD&D) Contract (Contract No. N00024-02-C-6316 in fiscal year 2002.  There have been no other contractual actions related to the direct development of the OASIS system since award of this contract.  The Government does not own the fully validated technical data package (TDP) and will not own the TDP until the end of contract N00024-02-C-6316, which is scheduled for completion in fiscal year 2006.    EDO is the Depot facility for the above Airborne Mine Counter Measures (AMCM) systems.  By PMS-495 direction, EDO is the Software Support Activity and the D! rawing Configuration Manager for the MK 105, OASIS, and Precise Navigation systems. The Government views all software and drawing changes, but the software and drawings reside at EDO under Contractor control. b)	Given the complexity of the MK-105, OASIS, and PNS systems and the level of system knowledge required to overhaul and repair this complex equipment and systems, EDO is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the engineering and design services to accomplish all tasking. c)	This is a follow-on contract for the acquisition of engineering services for continued development of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. In summary, there are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center  Panama City (NSWC PC), Panama City, Florida intends to award a contract to Lake Shore, Incorporated, 900 West Breitung Avenue, Kingsford, MI 49802-5316 on a sole source basis for the acquisition of two (2) each, AN/SLQ-48(V) Umbilical Cable Handling System (UCHS) Field Change Kits.  The AN/SLQ-48 system uses a remote-controlled submersible vehicle to identify underwater objects and, if they are mines, render them safe. The prime feature is the tethered TV and sonar-equipped Mine Neutralization Vehicle (MNV), which places an explosive destructive charge on bottom mines, and cuts the cables of moored mines.  Electrical power and data are transmitted via a neutrally-buoyant umbilical cable. Only Lake Shore can provide the UCHS field change kits for the following reasons.  There are two configurations of the UCHS. The original configuration contains obsolete hydraulic system components. The latest, current configuration is solely manufactu! red by and is proprietary to Lake Shore.  Lake Shore is the sole developer of the UCHS Field Change Kit to update the original configuration with new hydraulic system components and associated components that are currently available. To have any other manufacturer develop, fabricate and qualify another design for this kit would result in a duplication of costs and increase future support costs by adding yet another configuration to the inventory.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
This is a pre-solicitation notice for the NSRP Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) Program. Upon reasonable assurance that FY06 funds will be provided (expected summer 2005), the NSRP Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) Program plans to issue a formal Research Announcement on the research effort described below. The NSRP ASE program goal is to reduce the cost of building and maintaining U.S. Navy warships. To accomplish this, NSRP ASE is focused on industry-wide implementation of solutions to common cost drivers – solutions to consensus priority issues that exhibit a compelling business case to improve the efficiency of the U.S. Shipbuilding and Ship Repair Industry. Solutions include both leverage of best commercial practices and creation of industry-specific initiatives. Aggressive technology transfer to, and buy-in by, multiple U.S. shipyards is a requirement of all funded efforts. Successful projects are those that clearly reduce total ownership costs, benefits that can be delivered by varied combinations of cost reductions in acquisition and fleet life-cycle costs. Identification of specific cost reduction manifestation is an important element of NSRP program.  The complete Research Announcement (RA) will be posted at www.nsrp.org. This announcement is issued as a pre-solicitation notice to potential proposers since the response time to the formal solicitation will be limited due to the expected late start of this solicitation cycle relative to Navy expenditure rate requirements.  This notice will also provide ample time to review the soon-to-be-released Revision 4 of the Strategic Investment Plan (SIP). The formal Research Announcement will solicit proposals for research, development and implementation of best practices across the following major initiative areas in U.S. shipyards: Shipyard Production Process Technologies; Business Process Technologies; Product Design and Material Technologies; Systems Technologies; Facilities, Tooling and Risk Management; and Crosscut Initiatives. These major initiatives are described in detail in the Strategic Investment Plan located on the Web at www.nsrp.org. Offerors are strongly advised to read the SIP in order to gain a greater understanding of the sub-initiative areas detailed below. Because the program major initiatives are closely tied to each other, proposals may be submitted with a scope that represents integrated efforts across several major initiative and/or sub-initiative areas.  The Research Announcement will be modified as necessary to reflect changes in industry and/or government priorities.

Teaming
Teaming arrangements are encouraged. At least one U.S. shipyard should be substantially involved in each project, normally in a leadership role. Exceptions to this may be considered on a case-by-case basis where there is compelling justification that the program mission is best served by the proposed deviation. 

Awards
Due to limited funding, the NSRP ASE Program reserves the right to limit awards under any topic, and only proposals considered to be of superior quality will be funded. The NSRP ASE Program reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received. 

Awards will be made using a Technology Investment Agreement. These assistance instruments are not subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). A copy of the NSRP ASE Program Technology Investment Agreement will be available on the NSRP Web site (www.nsrp.org) under R&D Programs. 

For those proposals that are approved for award by the Executive Control Board (ECB), a letter contract will be executed immediately after the selection meeting.  This letter contract is expected to be for a period of 60 days with sufficient funding to conduct project kickoff activities.  All proposers, unless exceptions are authorized by the ECB for unusual circumstances (e.g., significant changes to the SOW directed by NSRP), will be expected to sign the final agreement within 60 days of selection. The NSRP ASE Program reserves the right to terminate awards if the offeror is not able to conclude a formal, signed Technology Investment Agreement (TIA) within 60 calendar days of selection notification.    

Proposal Preparation and Submittal
Offerors should obtain a copy of the latest NSRP Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise Proposal Preparation Kit (PPK) - version 4.5 will be made available on the NSRP Web site at www.nsrp.org.  This guide is specifically designed to assist offerors in understanding the RA proposal process.  The proposal format provided in the PPK is mandatory.  A link for submitting questions regarding the proposal process will be provided at www.nsrp.org.  All questions received and corresponding answers will be posted to this site (publicly accessible).  In addition, the NSRP ASE Program is anticipating to host a proposer’s conference at the Advanced Technology Institute, North Charleston, SC, to provide an overview of the program, explain the process, and answer general questions.  Once a firm date has been scheduled, additional information will be available by sending an email to nsrp@aticorp.org .

Abstracts for the formal Research Announcement will be optional, but if submitted must be in the format described in Attachment 4 of the PPK.  The due date for abstracts for this solicitation will be published when the decision is made to formally release a solicitation. Feedback on the abstracts will be provided to submitters approximately two weeks after receipt.  

Due date for full proposals in response to this RA will be published when the decision is made to formally release the solicitation.  Full proposals must be addressed to NSRP ASE Program Administrator, Advanced Technology Institute, 5300 International Blvd, North Charleston, SC 29418, Attn: Ms. Melissa Ingram, ATI Contracts Department. One original, unbound hard copy (each) of both the technical proposal and the cost proposal, four bound hard copies of the technical proposal, and three bound hard copies of the cost proposal are required. Offerors are also required to submit one copy (each) of the cost and technical proposals via virus-free electronic media (using Microsoft software - Windows 98 or later versions). Proposals received after the time and date specified will be returned to the proposer and will not be evaluated. No extensions will be granted.  Acknowledgement of receipt of proposals will be made after the due date.  For planning purposes, mandatory oral reviews for proposals evaluated to be in the competitive range will be conducted at a date to be determined.

REQUIREMENTS

Technical Description
A formal Research Announcement is expected to be issued to solicit proposals for research, development and implementation of best practices in U.S. shipyards as described in detail in the Strategic Investment Plan (SIP). A synopsis of the six major initiative areas follows.
	
	SHIPYARD PRODUCTION PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES
Shipyard Production Process Technologies addresses all production processes used to transform raw material, components and equipment into completed products for the shipbuilding and ship repair industry. Specifically, these processes include steel and aluminum fabrication, sub-assembly, assembly and erection, outfit fabrication, installation and test, surface preparation and paint, process control (accuracy control and process management), industrial engineering, production control (in-yard material planning and coordination), and services (transportation and rigging).

BUSINESS PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES  
	Business Process Technologies encompass all principal business processes required to rapidly and effectively respond to the customer's needs, from the initial business strategy development through life cycle support service that optimizes "Enterprise" value improvements. 
	
	PRODUCT DESIGN AND MATERIAL TECHNOLOGIES
Product Design and Material Technologies includes the design rules and standards; material standards and standardization, design and analysis tools; and engineering data required to rapidly and efficiently design modern ships in response to market inquiries and to support the follow on contract design, detail design and production phases. This major initiative includes the identification and development of advanced product designs and advanced materials, and the establishment and implementation of design for production methodologies to support development of the next generation of high performance ships.

	
	SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES
The overall application of information technologies to shipbuilding is categorized as Systems Technologies within the Strategic Investment Plan. The scope of systems technologies includes the underlying information systems infrastructure required to support the other initiatives with emphasis on the tools, environment, and integration required to reduce product realization lead time and provide for tighter coupling between enterprise functions. For the purpose of this initiative, the scope of Systems Technologies can be characterized as an “Integrated Shipbuilding Environment” (ISE).  By integrated, it is meant that the various business processes and their supporting information technology systems are able to accept and disseminate information electronically without manual intervention, passing paper, or off-line translations or reformatting. Information is entered once and reused throughout the ship lifecycle.

	
	FACILITIES, TOOLING AND RISK MANAGEMENT
	Facilities, Tooling and Risk Management includes the functions of providing and maintaining a physical plant capable of assembling, modifying and repairing ships in an efficient, safe, controllable and environmentally acceptable manner. This major initiative focuses on asset management issues such as facility utilization, facility planning, and maintenance.   Included with this major initiative are several risk avoidance issues such as environmental, safety, health, and ergonomic practices within the shipyard. 
	
	CROSSCUT INITIATIVES
Crosscut initiatives encompass the key factors related to people and organizations that can impact the successful implementation of technology advancements and changes in the shipbuilding and repair industry. These factors integrate into all of the major initiatives identified in the NSRP ASE program.  This announcement seeks both separate projects that focus on the crosscut factors in general, as well as proposed crosscut solutions developed as supporting elements of the other major ASE initiatives.  


SPECIFIC INTEREST AREAS

Lean / Six Sigma Enterprise Concepts
Of particular interest during this solicitation are initiatives directed toward furthering the U.S. shipbuilding and ship repair industry’s adoption of Lean / Six Sigma enterprise practices.  

	Shipyards are realizing the benefits of applying Lean, Six Sigma and other process improvement concepts throughout the entire value chain from supplier to the final customer.  The principles include specifying value in terms of the customer's needs, identifying the value streams for each product or service, creating continuous flow through the value streams, producing goods or services according to customer demand, and continuing to always improve and seek perfection.  There is industry interest in follow-on efforts that will build on the implementation of basic Lean / Six Sigma practices by introducing into shipbuilding and ship repair more advanced concepts and the means of integrating existing efforts with other process improvement and quality improvement programs.  Additionally, there is Congressional interest in seeing demonstration programs that apply Lean manufacturing technologies and processes to DOD acquisition programs in order to reduce total ownership cost, beginning with concept development and continuing through developmental testing.  

Enterprise Integration / Interoperability Enabling Concepts
The Navy continues to ask NSRP to extend, develop and implement collaborative approaches that support nationwide shipyard integration/interoperability and product data interoperability. The NSRP Strategic Investment Plan and the current Research Announcement are both structured to support these types of projects.   The objective of these efforts is to enable the sharing of production process and ship construction and repair data required to support a collaborative Naval shipbuilding and repair program across an extended enterprise. The ability to exchange production process and construction support data, such as engineering reports, construction status, test data, and objective quality evidence, is critical to the ability for multiple shipyards to collaborate.  An interoperable information environment is required to streamline NAVSEA enterprise information development, flow, and access. An interoperable environment will also support progressive improvement in materials procurement/management and configuration management, as well as worker (both knowledge worker and touch labor) productivity, enabling the continuous reduction of the cost of developing, building and supporting the fleet.  

Design for Production / Production Engineering
Findings of a recent benchmarking of U.S. shipyards echo or complement NSRP Strategic Investment Plan priorities in identifying a significant need in the areas of Design for Production (DFP) and Production Engineering. Specifically, the need is to focus on finding ways to improve the processes, tasks, tools and data associated with product definition throughout the product life cycle. DFP comparisons relate to the degree that ship designs consider production process considerations to enable highly efficient manufacturing and assembly. The objective of focusing on producibility in the design phase is to reduce production costs to a minimum, compatible with the requirements of the vessel to fulfill its operational functions with acceptable safety, reliability and efficiency.  DFP applications should include emphasis on design optimization to minimize material and work content, standardization and reduction of part count, design for self-alignment, and the application of group technology.

Production Engineering is the definition and organization of preferred production standards for product, methods and industrial engineering into readily accessible libraries of best practices, so that once a production engineering solution has been arrived at, the designer can employ those standards to produce design details which can be efficiently produced.  Recognizing the potential benefit, the Navy has increasingly attempted to adopt commercial standards and performance requirements where practical.  Significant joint industry/government cooperation will be required to make substantive gains in the production engineering arena.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 

Deliverable Items
The following deliverable data items shall be proposed: (a) Quarterly Technical Status Report; (b) Quarterly Business Status report (including participant provided funds); (c) Presentation Material, as required; (d) Contractor's Billing Voucher in accordance with milestone payment schedule; (e) Quarterly status report briefings; (f) Software Development Plan (if software development is proposed); (g) Technology Transfer Plan; (h) Project Management Plan; and (i) Final Technical Report (including Project Results Attachment). Appropriate interaction with Ship Production Panels and industry workshops should also be considered. Offerors are expected to also identify other deliverable items that are unique to their project. 
 

Security Requirements
Classified material is not expected to be used on this effort. 

Other Special Requirements
Proposers are advised that research findings and technology developments arising under this Agreement may constitute a significant enhancement to the national defense, and to the economic vitality of the United States.  As such, in the conduct of all work awarded under this agreement, the Recipient will comply strictly with the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (22 CFR 120-130), the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (DoD 5220.22-M) and the Department of Commerce Export Regulation (15 CFR 730-774.).

Anticipated Period of Performance:  Note: A determination has yet to be made on whether to allow multi-year proposals. It is the intent of the Program to solicit multi-year proposals if there is sufficient evidence of budgetary support for Government Fiscal Year 2007 and beyond.  
For this research announcement, offerors may submit multi-year proposals, provided they specify clearly defined one-year (or less), sequential (non-overlapping) project phases to allow for go/no-go decisions on future year efforts/funding. Each phase should specify key tasks (activities) and deliverables (results). The total length/duration of the technical effort is expected to vary by project complexity. It is anticipated that most projects will be 24 months or less in duration. It is recognized that particularly complex projects may require technical efforts of up to 36 months. The contractor may also provide for an additional 4 months for processing/completion of the final report. 

Expected Award Date
Approximately 150 days after release of the Research Announcement for most, if not all, selected proposals.  

Funding Estimate: It is anticipated that approximately $6M to $7M will be available for new NSRP ASE Program awards for this solicitation cycle if the final 2006 Navy budget develops as expected.  There is no guarantee of this funding level or that awards will be made in any individual topic areas. Multiple awards may be made in a given area depending, in part, on the cost of individual proposals and available funding. Potential funding levels for future years are described in the NSRP ASE Strategic Investment Plan available on the NSRP web site.  Some program funding may be used to support other methods of industry technology advancement, such as symposia and industry study groups.  

Type of Funding Instrument
The contractual vehicle used to fund the awards will be a Technology Investment Agreement (TIA).   A copy of the TIA will be posted on http://www.nsrp.org.  Proposals without an affirmative response to the cover page certification of agreement to abide by the terms and conditions of the Technology Investment will be subject to elimination during screening. Proposers are advised to contact the NSRP Director of Contracts if they have any questions on this requirement. Proposers are advised to check the NSRP web site periodically during the proposal preparation period for any new changes to the TIA terms and conditions.

Program Furnished Property
None contemplated. 

Notice to Foreign-Owned Firms: Such firms are asked to immediately notify the NSRP ASE Program Office point of contact cited below upon deciding to respond to the formal Research Announcement. Foreign contractors should be aware that prior Government approval may be required before their proposals can be considered.


Preparation Cost: The cost of preparing proposals in response to any formal Research Announcement is not considered a direct charge to any resulting award or any other contract. 

BASIS FOR AWARD

The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of an offeror's response (both technical and cost aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to the announcement. Details of the evaluation criteria are provided in the Proposal Preparation Kit, and are summarized below:

Technical Aspects
The technical aspect, which is ranked as the first order of priority relative to the other factors listed below, shall be evaluated based on the following criteria:  

Strategic fit and leverage
Business case
Innovation and technical merit
Technology transfer and industry implementation
Team strength and management plan

The first is the most important technical factor. Proposals that do not meet the strategic fit and leverage criteria will not be recommended for award.  The other four technical factors are of equal importance to each other.  Each is defined in greater detail in the Proposal Preparation Kit. 

Other Factors
a.	Cost share: The proposal shall demonstrate a commitment to share the cost and risk of the proposed effort. The NSRP ASE program goal is 50% cost share (i.e., for every dollar of program funding provided, industry will provide at least one (1) dollar in cost share). To the maximum extent practicable, industry-provided matching funds must come from non-Federal sources (Type B Matching Funds as defined in the Proposal Preparation Kit).  It is recognized that many proposers may be engaged in exclusive Government work, thereby reducing the sources of non-Federally reimbursed (Type B) funds. The offeror may therefore elect to include Federally reimbursed sources of funds (Type A Matching Funds as defined in the Proposal Preparation Kit) as matching funds, but these costs must be identified separately.  Where and to the extent the offeror cites Type A funds toward meeting the “sharing” or “matching” goals specified, this does not and need not constitute “cost sharing” as defined under DoDGARS 37.530.  The goal for Type B funds is to exceed 15% of the total program costs.  While there is no pre-determined cost share ratio requirement for any single project, the following incentives apply: (1) Shipyard-specific proposals are expected to provide significantly higher cost share than collaborative projects, and (2) All projects will compete on, among other factors, the degree to which the proposers will share the cost and thus leverage program funds.  Additional information regarding allowable types of cost share can be found in the NSRP ASE Proposal Preparation Kit.
b.	Shipyard Specific Projects
Most of the program funding will be applied toward open, collaborative projects that are widely acceptable with broad applicability.  For this reason, most projects will be recommended for award on the basis of sharing results within the U.S. industry. It is anticipated that some projects with limited access, and limited or delayed applicability to the broad industry will be awarded, but these projects will require substantially higher cost share. The estimated fraction of a proposed project's funding that will be used in developing technologies that will be openly shared without delay, such that a higher percentage of the results are shared, will be considered in the evaluation.  Proposals with a higher degree of results that are openly shared and readily transferable throughout the industry will be viewed more favorably.
c.	Project Execution
Proposers are encouraged to demonstrate evidence of a committed team ready to move out quickly upon award with an aggressive, credible execution schedule.  Proposals that demonstrate such commitment will benefit during the technical evaluation process when compared to otherwise equally acceptable proposals that do not show such commitment.
d.	Crosscut Initiatives
The degree to which the proposed project addresses Crosscut Initiative areas (Education & Training, Technology Transfer, Workforce Development & Retention, Organizational & Cultural Change, Human Resources) will be evaluated.

Cost Aspects: The Cost Proposal will be evaluated for completeness, reasonableness and realism of the proposed costs.  Additionally, proposed spending profiles will be considered in the context of program financial requirements and constraints. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time. 

POINT OF CONTACT  
Questions related to this RA should be directed to the NSRP ASE Program Office, Advanced Technology Institute.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency intends to award a contract for "Research Support for Environmental Method Development, Measurement Modeling, Characterization, and Exposure Assessment" for the Office of Research and Development (ORD) National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) Human Exposure and Atmospheric Sciences Division (HEASD).  The acquisition will be made by way of full and open competition.  A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  The resulting contract is expected to have a Base Year (beginning on or about July 01, 2005) and four single year option periods (continuing through June 30, 2010 if all options are exercised).  The associated NAICS Code is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  This procurement will not be made under FAR Part 12 provisions.  This effort will support the NERL/ORD's broad responsibilities in characterizing and quantifying the source, transport, transformation, fate and characterization of a wide variety of toxic pollutants across the human exposure and ecological paradigm.  It will also include determinations of the physical, chemical, and other characteristics of aerosol pollutants which include particulate matter (PM) and gases, and how these characteristics affect the entry of the pollutants into humans and the environment.  This will be NERL/ORD's leading research vehicle for the following research responsibilities:  (1) develop and validate instrumentation, (2) methodologies (including U.S. EPA reference Methods), (3) manuals, (4) guidelines, (5) Standard Operating Procedures, and (6) Quality Assurance Procedures (QAP) for the measurement of ambient levels fo pollutants of concern to the U.S. EPA.  These resultant instruments, methods, QAP, etc., will be used by the U.S. EPA as it's major basis of validating measurements of ambient levels of pollutants that are of concern to the U.S. EPA.  The U.S. EPA relies on the validated instrumentation methodology and QAP as it is the main source of support in determining the validity of it's ambient pollutant determinations.  The U.S. EPA's ambient pollutant data is an essential part of the basis for the U.S. EPA's regulatory ambient air standards for enforcement of the standards.  A pre-proposal conference will be held in association with this procurement.  Interested parties should monitor the U.S. EPA's website shown at the end of this announcement for further details.  It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on or about November 30, 2004.  Proposals will be due approximately 45 days after the Request for Proposals (RFP) issuance date.  This acquisition represents a follow-on to contract 68-D-00-206.  A copy of the Statement of Work (SOW) for contract 68-D-00-206 is posted for review, at the internet site listed below.  The solicitation and all amendments for this procurement will be available via the internet at the following URL:  http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/.

Therefore,  EPA believes that National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine, is the only vendor qualified with the expertise capable of satisfying this requirement.  The circumstance permitting "Other than Full and Open Competition" is FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" at this time.  The anticipated period of performance is 12 months.   All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Robin S.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 332312   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.EPA), Science and Ecosystem Support Division (SESD) intends to award a sole source, firm fixed priced, purchase order using Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Geoprobe Systems, Salina, Kansas 67401.  The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase a Geoprobe Tracked Direct-Push Machine (#6620DT).  We intend to select Geoprobe Systems as a sole-source vendor for this direct-push machine based on compatibility issues with a Membrane Interface Probe (MIP) system currently in  our  inventory.  The MIP system is a proprietary product of Geoprobe Systems and its components are not available from other vendors.  This system is designed to fit Geoprobe System machines, and the machines have been built to accommodate the MIP system.  The MIP system includes various  transducers that monitor feed system movement on the direct-push machine.  These transducers are designed to mate with the Geoprobe machines, and vice-versa.  The transducers are not constructed to mount to other machines.  Also, the direct-push machine uses a hydraulic hammer to drive the probe  underground.  The Geoprobe Systems hammer outfits with a cushion device to dampen the high-frequency hammer energy.  In the absence of the cushion, the MIP system would quickly be damaged.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 332312.  NO  SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  Any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein should submit a response in writing to U.S. EPA, Region 4, Office of Acquisition Management, 61 Forsyth Street, Atlanta, GA 30303, ATTN: Deborah Hoover.   Responses to this requirement must be received by 4:30 PM EST, on July 13, 2005, and must contain your capability to meet EPA's requirement.  Only responses received by this date will be considered.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is  solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions should be directed to Deborah Hoover, Contracting Officer via e-mail at hoover.deborah@epa.gov.

The gradient coil presently in the 4.7T MRI is unable to provide the gradient strengths necessary for high resolution imaging and diffusion tensor imaging of non-human primates.  The new gradient coil will yield better spatial and temporal resolution in the studies performed on the 4.7T Bruker Avance MRI which will provide valuable biological information about the source and cause of several diseases.  The new gradient coil must meet the following requirements:  1)  have a peak gradient strength of at least 23 gauss/cm on all three axes using a 300A, 600V gradient amplifier;  2)  have an inner diameter of 260mm;  3) have an outer diameter of less than 400mm;  4)  be actively shielded;  5) be equipped with B0, linear, and quadratic shim channels;  6)  have a high bandwidth shim amplifier; and 7) be capable of operating with the hardware and software currently in the 4.7T scanner.
The Resonance Research Inc. gradient coil is compatible with the existing equipment and the only system known to the NINDS researcher that can meet the aforementioned requirements. This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 2:00 p.m. EDT, on June 29, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted. NAICS: 334516; Size Standard is 500 employees.

•	Developing and implementing strategies to increase Internet access for individuals residing on remote locations such as tribal lands and rural areas (e.g. assisting Indian tribes to establish Internet Service Provider (ISP) companies.)
•	Developing and supporting non-traditional business structures (such as home-based businesses, agribusinesses, aqua-farming, folk art, etc.) and niche markets including exporting, e-commerce, trade and tourism, etc.
•	Establishing local resource centers to provide American Indians, Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiians entrepreneur’s access to the most current resources available, including the necessary hardware and software to access information online.
•	Developing and implementing quality training, counseling and access to resources to specialized target groups such as Youth Entrepreneurs, Veterans, active Military and Reservist.

<DESC>The NWBC offers small business researchers the opportunity to have access to special tabulations from the US Census Bureau of women-owned employer establishments from 1997-2001.  The NWBC willfund one or two special analysis projects, looking for creative ideas from the research community focused on: changes over time, special populations, or innovative theories about business growth or challenges.

STATEMENT OF WORK – 
SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF 
CENSUS DATASET 


BACKGROUND

The National Women’s Business Council is a bi-partisan public policy advisory body created to serve as an independent source of advice to the President, Congress, and others on economic issues of importance to women business owners.  The Council is committed to:
•	Conducting research on issues of importance to women business owners and their organizations; 
•	Communicating these findings widely; 
•	Connecting the women’s business community to public policy makers; and 
•	Providing a platform for change to expand and improve opportunities for women business owners and their enterprises.

Through an ongoing agreement with the Census Bureau, the NWBC receives custom tabulations on the number and growth of women-owned employer firms on an annual basis. The tabulations received thus far look specifically at employer establishments in existence in 1997 (the most recent Census year) and how they have changed (in number and employment) in each year since. We have produced two Issues in Brief report looking at changes in survival and employment among all women-owned firms, from 1997 to 2000 and 1997 to 2001, as well as five Issues in Brief focused on 1997 to 2000 trends among firms owned by women of color. Please visit our web site (www.nwbc.gov)  to review these reports. 

This dataset offers a rich opportunity for researchers, and we would like to alert the academic and researcher community of the availability of this dataset – and to underwrite one or two small analysis projects utilizing the data.

STATEMENT OF WORK

The successful bidder will focus on a discrete trend or hypothesis and, utilizing the tables available from the Census Bureau, produce a concise and actionable analysis (see Attachment A for description of dataset and variables). Topics focused on regions, changes over time, or specific populations (industry or ethnicity) are especially encouraged. Creativity in proposed area of focus will play a large role in the contract award.

Task Number One:	Review available data and recommend specific areas for analysis
Task Number Two:	Data analysis.
Task Number Three:	Development of findings and preparation of draft and final report. 

PROGRESS REPORTS
The contractor shall be required to provide a report detailing the progress made on the project and identifying and addressing problems encountered. This progress report shall be delivered to the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (“COTR”). At the end of one month, the contractor shall first provide a preliminary report to the COTR showing the recommended analysis and analysis plan, including method and design. The contractor shall also include in the report a timely response to any questions or clarification of any points raised by the COTR about the data, or analysis method and design. At monthly intervals from the date of contract award, the contractor shall provide interim reports on the progress and shall also provide a timely response to any questions or clarification on any points raised by the COTR about the interim reports. Monthly payments will be made to the contractor up to 80% of the contract value. At least one draft version of the report shall be supplied to the COTR in advance of the final deliverable. The final report must take into consideration comments received from government employees and the COTR. The final 20% of the contract value will be paid upon delivery of the final report, as noted below.

STATEMENT OF WORK – 
REVAMPING CONTENT OF WOMENBIZ.GOV WEB SITE 




BACKGROUND

The National Women’s Business Council is a bi-partisan public policy advisory body created to serve as an independent source of advice to the President, Congress, and others on economic issues of importance to women business owners.  The Council is committed to:
•	Conducting research on issues of importance to women business owners and their organizations; 
•	Communicating these findings widely; 
•	Connecting the women’s business community to public policy makers; and 
•	Providing a platform for change to expand and improve opportunities for women business owners and their enterprises.

Several years ago, in response to demand from the women’s business community for information and guidance on how to access federal government procurement markets, the National Women’s Business Council launched the web site www.womenbiz.gov. The side contains information on the steps required to enter into the federal procurement arena, including links to government agency web sites and information on procurement fairs and matchmaking events.

However, in the years since the launch of that site, there have been advances in Internet/web site technology and more information and links in the federal procurement system. This proposed project would focus primarily on increasing the robustness of the content and included linkages of the aforementioned web site, utilizing input and beta testing from a select number of women business owners and federal agency women’s business advocates in Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBUs), who will be identified by the NWBC. Secondarily, we seek recommendations on reorganizing and reprogramming the web site to take advantage of new web technologies. (This should be listed separately in the cost proposal.)

STATEMENT OF WORK

Task Number One:	Review womenbiz.gov web site and make preliminary recommendations on revamping, increasing content and connectivity of web site. If option to restructure web site is approved by NWBC, provide preliminary recommendations on restructuring of web site pages.

Task Number Two:	In consultation with NWBC staff, assemble two small (6-8 each) groups to act as virtual focus groups or beta testers: 1) women business owners who are active or interested in the federal marketplace; and 2) staff of federal OSDBU offices who are charged with working to increase their agency’s spending with women-owned small businesses. They will be asked to review the existing site, provide recommendations, and review and perhaps beta test the proposed changes.
Task Number Three:	After review of proposed changes, provide NWBC with a page by page
update of the content of the womenbiz.gov web site, in a mutually agreed-upon format. 

Task Number Four:	If web site structural changes are agreed to, provide the new or altered pages in a mutually-agreed upon format, working with SBA web master staff to beta test the structural changes. 

Task Number Five:	Provide final archived copies of all text and/or code, both electronically for easy integration to the existing site and on CD for archival purposes.. 


PROGRESS REPORTS

The contractor shall be required to provide regular reports detailing the progress made on the project and identifying and addressing problems encountered. This progress report shall be delivered to the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (“COTR”). Progress payments will be made upon receipt of these regular reports, up to 80% of the contract value. Upon successful completion of the project and provision of all deliverable products for the project, the final payment of 20% of the contract value will be approved and made.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Hollings Marine Laboratory, at Charleston, South Carolina, intends to procure services for the installation of a full-featured Laboratory Management System (LIMS) for the Marine Genomics (MG) core for the Oceans and Human Health Initiative (OHHI).    The function of the Marine Genomic (MG) core is to develop and utilize functional genomics tools for the accurate, quantitative, simultaneous measurement of the expression (transcription) of thousands of genes in a marine organism.  These tools will be used to characterize the overall health of the organism and to assess the status of specific genetic pathways diagnostic of exposure to particular stressors.  The workflow of the MG is a series of steps or a pipeline that in essence is a laboratory workflow of dependent activities that need to be well-documented and managed from beginning to end.  In addition, this is a high-throughput, production-oriented facility and the LIMS cannot be a passive system but needs to take an active role, directing samples from one activity to another in order to meet the lab’s objectives.  The objectives of the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) are sample tracking initiated at the onset of the experimental workflow with the intent of following the extraction of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) and creation of cDNA through library construction, storage and experimental analysis.  Specific activities are:  (1) Development of an inventory control system (using barcodes). (2)  The physical selection, archival, and usage of ESTs/cDNA Libraries will be handled by a Genetix QBot.   (3)  Support a catalog of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) and Complimentary DNA (cDNA) attribute information in a database management system.  (4)  Development of a management system for the purpose of documenting and archiving the experimental process, essentially an electronic “laboratory notebook”.  (5)  The ability to generate specific reports on all of these activities and final hybridization experimental results.  (6)  The LIMS must support the development of Web-based application for various activities associated with laboratory management and experiment management activities in addition to reporting tools.  (7)  The LIMS needs to be customizable to meet the specific current and future needs of the MG with minimal programming effort and does not require added fees for in-house development/programming of added tools and functionality.   System Specifications for Capabilities include:  (1) Experiment and Laboratory Management.  (2) Inventory Control (3) Robot/Instrument Integration (4) Data Import and Export. (5)  Reporting, and (6) Security.   System Specifications for Architecture include:  Highly available, Secure, and Reliable/Scalable.  System Specifications for Hardware and Software include:  Database Server, Application Server, Network Hardware, Networking with Client Workstations.  There is also a requirement for Training and On-Site Set-up.  
The Government intends to award a contract under FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. The resultant contract will be firm-fixed price.  Completion time for the project is 365 calendar days.  This will be a total small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 541519 and small business standard is 150 employees.

Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.

<DESC>Researchers at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) have developed a new power coil design that incorporates a two layered metal construction.  The bi-metal feature increases the amount of magnetic flux in the copper wire and causes an increase in power output from the coil wire.  The initial testing results indicate an increase of generated power of between 14 and 18 percent over a standard coil design.  This coil design will aid in increasing the efficiency of generators, alternators, and any device used to generate electricity from a coil design. Application could be windmill generators, hydro-generators, automotive generators, and motors.

The INL is soliciting interest from qualified industrial firms interested in participating in projects and commercializing this technology.  It is anticipated that commercialization will be carried out by licensing this technology to a company.  Additional development and support may be possible through Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with some or all of the funding support being provided by the participant(s).  The INL invites interested parties to contact us regarding the details of licensing and implementing this technology into an operation.  Interested parties should respond on or before August 1, 2005.  For questions regarding the technology, licensing, and working with the INL, please contact Ida Shum:

<SUBJECT>A -- SPECIALTY NETWORK LABORATORY CAPABILITY
<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI) only. There is no solicitation available. This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, or a Request for Quotes. It is not an indication the government will contract for the services contained in this RFI. The government shall not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI.

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), this notice serves as a request for information for scientific and technical support services to support the U.S. Air Force in carrying out its mission. The USAF may have a requirement for expertise and work effort in the following areas: (1) Molecular biology to include genetic screening using real time PCR techniques, genetic sequencing, and micro-array technologies; (2) Microbial culture; (3) Immunology to include protein screening, mass spectrometry technologies (including MS to the Nth technologies); (4) Separation of biological materials of interest from complex sample matrices; (5) Meteorological support to include models of transport and diffusion processes; and (6) Additional technical areas of interest which may be identified. 

The purpose of this RFI is to receive industry feedback regarding the accomplishment of the above tasks. A generic management approach is desired to provide the necessary resources, under one contract, that would provide the expertise for successful performance in these areas.  Rather than a “one firm solution,” with expertise in all of the above areas, an understanding is requested of Industry’s approach to managing a team of resources (e.g., contractors, laboratories) that would also support the rapid acquisition of additional resources as new tasks, technologies and/or capabilities are identified.   The government is not interested in any team that a member of industry could assemble and respond with, but rather the overall approach a firm would utilize in minimizing costs and managing a complex and ever-changing environment that would provide the resources for the above tasks along with the flexibility for accessing new resources as required. 

Only nonproprietary information should be submitted. Any proprietary information submitted will be returned to the sending party and not reviewed.

Interested respondents having questions with respect to the information requested in the RFI should direct them in writing to the contract specialist daniel.gill@patrick.af.mil.

All communication regarding this RFI, including submissions, should be in writing and submitted to the contact above. Responses to this Request for Information are not required but are highly encouraged as your suggestions and comments will be especially valuable if the government develops an acquisition strategy.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-04 and DFARs Change Notice (DCN) 20050606.  Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code is 5410 and the size standard is 500 employees.  NAICS is 332311.
This acquisition is a 100% small business set aside.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures (the award will be less than $100,000) will be followed. The solicitation is to provide and install one (1) metal shelter at Edwards AFB CA.

Installation shall be in accordance with the Statement of Work detailed below.
STATEMENT OF WORK - PROVIDE AND INSTALL AIRCRAFT SHELTER
1. OBJECTIVE. The objective of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide and install metal covered aircraft shelter to support Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Flight Test at a designated location within the flightline ramp area at Edwards Air Force Base. The building must be then disassembled and re-erected at a nearby location at later date. This is to be a turnkey project.
2. CONSTRUCTION. The building will be heated with forced hot air, effectively acting as an oven with internal air temperatures up to 225 degrees Fahrenheit. Due to solar loading, metallic structural materials might reach 250 degrees Fahrenheit.
2.1. Size - The building must accommodate aircraft with approximately five (5) feet with of additional clearance on nose, tail, and vertical stabilizers. This means the interior
chamber dimensions must be no less than 72 feet long, 52 feet and 6 inches wide, 23 feet high (along building centerline and approximately 72 feet lateral to the centerline in each direction), and not less than approximately 8 feet high (at outer walls).
2.2. Sealants and Coatings - Building should be water tight using metal-only construction without the use of sealing compounds. Paint or other coatings are not required or desired.
2.3. Polymeric or Other Combustible Materials - Designs that minimize or eliminate the use of polymers and other combustible or non-heat resistant materials (will not perform at 250 degrees Fahrenheit) will be preferred. However, interim alternate solutions during heated operations will be considered, i.e. non-permanent door sealing techniques from the exterior.
2.4. Insulation - Insulation is desired, but must be exterior. Interior insulation will absorb
and subsequently desorb chemical vapors that may prejudice test results. Please quote
cost if exterior insulation is available with an R-factor of 2 or greater.

<DESC>eLease

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Part 12 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 511210 with a small business size standard of $21,000,000 annual gross receipts for a period of three years. 

General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Physical Capital Asset Management Division (PGE), is requesting services for the Software Tool Evaluation for eLease Present Value Calculation.   eLease is designed to help Realty Specialists (RS) perform their work electronically. An important part of the leasing process is to receive and process offers of space available for leasing.  In order to accomplish these tasks, the RS has to enter data about each offer into the eLease application, which will then perform calculations and return the Present Value (PV), a value important to the decision-making process.

Currently, the RS uses Excel spreadsheets with formulas to calculate the PV.  The formulas in these spreadsheets change over time, so at any time it is possible that an RS is working with an outdated version of the PV spreadsheet.  In addition, the uninitiated Excel spreadsheet user could commit basic mistakes such as erasing or changing a formula, which could unintentionally lead to the wrong PV Analysis. Also, it is expected that the PV Analysis formulas will change frequently, at minimum on an annual basis.

As a solution, eLease was requested to provide the RS with data entry screens to collect offer data and to perform the PV Analysis calculation.   The technology identified to leverage the solution involves a server-side Excel spreadsheet calculation tool.  This tool will minimize end-user errors. Furthermore, the server-side Excel spreadsheet calculation tool is a far more maintainable solution since any changes to the formulas are done in one place on the server and all eLease users will have immediate access to the new formula.   

Since the eLease server is run on UNIX, the server-side spreadsheet calculation is required to run on this platform.  Unfortunately, our research has resulted in only two companies that have this type of product that can be used in the eLease implementation. 

 
There are several product-neutral requirements for the Present Value Analysis module of eLease. The product must be able to:

-	Run on the UNIX platform, because eLease servers run on UNIX 
-	Run on any server (be Java-based)
-	Remain threadsafe, because eLease is a multi-threaded application
-	Read data from the eLease database and populate a spreadsheet template (stored on the server) with the data 
-	Perform numerous calculations, embedded in the spreadsheet template, on the imported data
-	Store the calculated results back into the eLease database
-	Handle as many Excel functions as are feasible given the server-side nature of the implementation, because the formulas change regularly

The Formula One e.Spreadsheet Engine is a unique match for the needs of eLease. It is Java-based, threadsafe, and runs on UNIX. It can read data from a database or from a Web form, perform calculations, and send the results back to the server for database storage. Formula One can handle 326 of the 329 Excel functions; the three that are not implemented are deemed impractical to be run on server-side.

Formula One is easy to use and has a small footprint of 6MB. It is also highly likely that Formula One will be able to remain up-to-date with new releases of Microsoft Excel, because it is a market leader. It offers excellent maintenance and support. Pricing for 
Formula One is on a per-server basis, not a per-CPU basis, and so if eLease servers are ever upgraded, additional license fees will not apply. Formula One’s robust functionality also could be extremely useful for other modules in eLease, and even perhaps other applications yet to be designed, developed, and eventually run on the eLease servers. 

Finally, Formula One has the ability to dynamically generate and deliver fully editable Excel files as reports such as outlining and charts files. Formula One also provides a spreadsheet-like interface that can be embedded in an application. This interface functions like Excel and in addition, changes in the interface’s grid can be saved as a real Excel file. These features are unique to Formula One.

 
The Contractor shall submit their proposals for the following items:

A total of three (3) servers will require licenses   – one for development, one for testing (IV&V), and one for production. Formula One’s pricing does not take into account the number of CPUs in the servers; therefore we will require three server licenses and three server support packages. In addition, there will be two people working simultaneously at any given time with the software: either two developers or a developer and a tester, depending on the stage of development. Therefore, we also need two developer licenses and developer support packages. 

01	Formula One e.Spreadsheet Engine Service (Qty: 3)
02	Server Support and Maintenance (Qty: 3)
03	Formula One e.Spreadsheet Engine Developer (Qty: 2)
04	Developer Support and Maintenance (Qty: 2)

(Delivery must be made within 7 days.) 

Submission of Proposals:  The contractor shall submit their proposal on or before 12:00p, June 29, 2005.  All questions are due on or before 12:00p, June 27, 2005.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 511210 ($21M annual gross receipts for three years).  Proposals will be evaluated based on the lowest price to the government.  Offerors must submit their final proposals for evaluation.  Proposals must be submitted (hard copies) to 1800 F Street, NW, 4th Floor, Washington, DC  20405.  

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions are hereby applicable and incorporated by reference:  1) The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items; and 3) The provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment No. Two of synopsis/solicitation number OAM-2006-N-001 is to respond to one additional clarification question GAO received regarding the fire alarm, fire extinguisher, and emergency lighting inspection, maintenance, testing and repair services requirement for the U. S. Government Accountability Office at its headquarters in Washington DC.  The original FedBizOpps notice was posted on June 1, 2005, and initial questions and GAO’s responses (Amendment no. 1) were posted in the FedBizOpps on June 17, 2005.   A restatement of the initial question and initial GAO response that required additional clarification is stated below.   The questions and GAO’s response are provided as follows:	Previous Question - If you mean electrician, do they need an electrician license for DC?	Previous response - See Section II A 3, which states:  “shall have certificates of training, licenses, proper insurance, and permits as required by the District of Columbia.	Clarification Question – Does GAO mean Technician or Electrician? Your answer refers me to Section II a 2 and 3.  In this section our Company Senior Technicians would qualify under these rules, however we don't call them electricians we call them technicians.  An electrician is someone who holds a Master Electrician license with the state, city they primarily work, but does not necessarily have the qualifications in Fire Alarm systems, a Senior Technician has all the qualifications of these sections, however they do not hold Master Electrician licenses.  We would like to have the term electrician replaced with technician as to make it more open to all vendors and make it more clear.	Final response – GAO requires the qualifications of personnel as stated in Section II A 3 regardless of titles (either Electrician or Technician).   In response to the “further clarification of the previous question”, the RFP was revised to change where applicable the personnel titles from Senior Electrician to Technician and Electrician helper to Technician Helper for personnel performing the statement of work requirements and must meet all stated qualifications for the substituted titles that are required by the RFP.All firms that have requested and received a copy of the RFP addendum with additional contract requirements will receive a copy of this Amendment No. two by email along with a revised copy of the RFP Addendum. Those firms that have not requested the RFP addendum (see Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Notice code 99 dated June 01, 2005), and have not been provided GAO’s responses to the questions received regarding the RFP that was posted in FedBizOpps dated June 17, 2005, must request documents by emailing Brandon Levin (Contract Specialist) (Levinb@gao.gov). Again, those firms that have emailed GAO for a copy of the RFP addendum will be automatically sent this amendment. The date and time for receiving all proposals remains unchanged; 2:00pm (EDT) June 30, 2005. (A reformatted copy of this information is attached as a PDF file for legibility) ****

<DESC>The solicitation is amended to include the following language from the Statement of Work previously omitted and to provide answers to questions:
1.  The solicitation is to retrofit (remanufacture) low voltage breakers used in 460 volt electrical panels.  The required work will be performed on Federal Pacific breakers only of the same type and serial numbers.  2.  The work will not require the contractor to be on site at any time.  The required information from the breaker name plate will be provided, and the academy electrical shop will remove and install the breakers.  3.  Currently we have 100 plus breakers in service or in storage.  The number of breakers we have retrofitted will be determined by the quoted price for retrofit and the amount of funding made available.  4.  The breakers will be made available for retrofit on a rotational basis.  The FBI will initially provide four spare breakers of assorted models listed for remanufacture and upon return of those breakers, we will make four more available.  5.  Each breaker will be completely re-manufactured to include braking the breaker completely down.  All wiring will be replaced.  All metal parts will be cleaned, re-plated, re-silvered, repainted or replaced.  All current carrying parts will be re-silver plated and treated with anti-tarnishing agent.  All phenolic insulation will be cleaned, re-coated and tested.  All breakers will be re-assembled to manufactured specifications.  6.  Each breaker will be trip tested to within a current of 90 to 100 percent of its breaker trip coil setting.  7.  A solid state tripping device will be incorporated into each switch enabling the user to set parameters of protective limits.  AC Pro is the current type in use on switches that have this protection.  8.  Original ARC Chutes will be replaced with new non-asbestoes Arc Chutes.  Each switch contains three each.  9.  The contractor will be responsible for return packaging, handling, and shipping.

The following question was received and the answer is provided:
Question: Are the breakers electrically or manually operated?
Answer:  The breakers are manually operated with electrical charging motors.

<DESC>OCS DISASTER RECOVERY SERVICES
The purpose of this amendment is to:

Section C.4   Real Time Options (Not Mandatory) is hereby amended to include:

The offeror is to propose an option for providing space and workstations for staff members of OCS or its customers in the event it is needed in a declared disaster.  Each workstation must be equipped with a commonly available operating system, routine business application software (word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, etc.), and be equipped with both voice and data communications capability.  The government does not anticipate more than twenty-four workstations.   The space must be located within 300 miles of Springfield, Virginia.   Please structure pricing per workstation including space and identify any volume discounts that would apply.  

The following questions, answers and clarifications are provided:

1) Under past performance it does not state how many you want?   It is highly recommended to include past performance for the past three years.  
 
2) We did not see any information on if Small Business and Small Disadvantage Businesses are encouraged on bidding on this RFP and will be awarded additional points during the review of responses? 
This is a very important procurement to the Department of Commerce and we are encouraging the maximum level of competition and therefore a full and open competition. 
3) We did not see any Section K on Viability/Stability of the organization? 
"The evaluation criteria stated in the solicitation under Numbers 1, 2 and 3 will rate the offeror's "Corporate Resources", "Past Performance" and "Proposed Resources and Management Approach".  It is the responsibility of the offeror within their technical proposal to address each of these areas sufficiently to provide the information required to evaluate each company's viability/stability of their individual organizations."  

4) Will there be a pre-bid conference?  No.  We are not planning to conduct a pre-bid conference.

5) If there is a current contract in place for this service, please provide contractor and address.  SunGard Recovery Services, Herndon, VA

All other terms and conditions of the original announcement posted on May 27, 2005 and Amendment 001 posted on June 19, 2005, remains unchanged and applicable to this combined solicitation announcement.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0003 - The purpose of Amendment 0003 is to change the solicitation from sole source to full and open competition, extend the proposal due date and further clarify the combined synopsis.  The following changes are incorporated in Amendment 0 003: (1)  This solicitation is amended to reflect full and open competition vice sole source. (2)  The proposal due date is extended to Wednesday, 29 June 2005 at 6:00 PM EST (4:00 PM Local). (3)  The following responses to questions regarding the combined synopsis are provided:  Q: Should the fans and VFDs be rated as specified (expecting a later change order)? Or should the spec be amended to reflect the properly sized blower and VFD set? A. The static pressure rating for the fan is inadequate for proper system operation, therefore the fan specification should be ammended to read 2000 CFM @ 6 Inch SP. Q: Can the Offeror assume that CWA are limited those that are readily adsorbed by non-impregnated activated carbon?  And is the qualification for the adsorber still per IEST-RP-CC-008 (i.e. 3-log reduction against a Freon challenge)? A. The CWA encountered within this system is readily adsorbed by non-impregnated activated carbon.  The qualification for the adsorber is IEST-RP-CC-008, three-log reduction against Freon challenge. Q: Should the fans and VFDs be rated as specified (expecting a later change order)? Or should the spec be amended to reflect the properly sized blower and VFD set? A. Amended to 2000 CFM @ 6 Inch static pressure. Q: Can the Offeror assume that CWA are limited those that are readily adsorbed by non-impregnated activated carbon?  And is the qualification for the adsorber still per IEST-RP-CC-008 (i.e. 3-log reduction against a Freon challenge)? A. The CWA encountered within this system is readily adsorbed by non-impregnated activated carbon.  The qualification for the adsorber is IEST-RP-CC-008, three-log reduction against Freon challenge. Q. If the operating voltage is 208 then why is the control transformer 460:120?  A. The 460 volt reference is a typo, there is no requirement for 460 VAC service.  Power supplied to the filter blower will be 208 VAC 3 phase, with control power step-down methods at the discretion of the vendor.
