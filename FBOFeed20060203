<CONTACT>Paul Kennedy  Contracting Officer 7037871143     paul.kennedy@mms.gov;
<DESC>1.  The purpose of this Amendment is to delete Amendment 01 in its entirety due to an adminsitrative error in the FedBizOps transmission and replace it with Amendment 02 which contains the same information that was in Amendment 01. 2.  Therefore, add the following hardware items that were inadvertently left out of the initial solicitation as follows:     " Paragraph 1.3.b.6:  Add Fingerprint Image Server (FIS) and UPS for the FIS" 3.  In addition to the above, the Government hereby provides a list of questions and associated answers received to date in response to GovWorks RFP 60403. 4.The proposal receipt date is NOT extended.                                         QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS RFP Number 1435-04-06-RP-60403 US MEPCOM Fingerprint Services/Software and Equipment Maintenance 1.  Question:  Schedule of Supplies/Services (RFP page 3):  Line items 0003, 0103, 0203, 0303, and 0403 are Other Direct Cost (ODC) CLINs each with an annual limit of $5,000.  Is it correct to assume that these ODC CLINs are to cover ODCs, such as travel costs, for both the Firm Fixed Price CLINs and the T&M (additional services) CLINs?  ANSWER:  Yes. 2.  Schedule of Supplies/Services (RFP page 6):  Line item 0303 is identified as an ODC CLIN with an NTE of $5,000 per year.  The Total Price for this CLIN indicates an NTE of $100,000.  Is it correct to assume that this is a typo and the total price should read "Not to Exceed $5,000"? ANSWER:   Yes, it is a typo.  Should read "Not to Exceed $5,000." 3. QUESTION:  Performance Work Statement paragraph 1.3 (page 9):  Paragraph 1.3 of the PWS includes the sentence "This task will require, at a minimum, an IT-1:  SSBI investigation", requiring personnel to hold an IT-1 clearance, which requires a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).  Since this sentence follows a sentence relating to mandated software changes, it is unclear whether the IT-1 requirement applies to all personnel who may work on the contract, or just those associated with responding to mandated software changes.  Due to the nature of this contract, many contractor personnel may be required during the contract performance to meet the contract requirements, but very few of those individuals would be performing tasks in positions which could jeopardize national security.  It would seem unnecessary for all of these personnel to require IT-1 clearances or even IT-II (national agency check with law and credit) or IT-III (national agency check) investigations.  Please clarify the clearance/investigation requirements for this contract. ANSWER:    Only those individuals who are system administrators for EFCS will require an IT-1 clearance.  This is per Section V 4-14 of AR 25-2.  This includes administrators for both the hardware and the software of EFCS.  Any individual who does not have administrator privileges will not require an IT-1 clearance. 4.  QUESTION:  Performance Work Statement paragraph 1.3 (page 10):  Paragraph 1.3.a describes the requirements for the FIS software updates.  The task described (demonstrating the updated FIS functionality) seems to be a one-time event, possibly during the 6-month base period.  It is unclear whether the Contractor is to price any software updates during the four option periods since that effort is not yet defined and could not be accurately priced in the Firm Fixed Price CLINs.  Is it correct to assume that only the initial software updates are to be priced (i.e., in CLIN 0001) and any future software updates would be proposed as task orders under a T&M arrangement?  ANSWER:  Yes, correct. 5.  QUESTION:  Performance Work Statement paragraph 1.3 (page 10):  Paragraph 1.3.b describes the requirements for the Maintenance Contractor's Help Desk.  Is it correct to assume that USMEPCOM will maintain its own help desk (providing the direct interface to the MEPS) and the calls to the Maintenance Contractor's Help Desk will come from the USMEPCOM Help Desk? ANSWER:  Yes. 6.  QUESTION:  Performance Work Statement paragraph 1.3 (page 10):  Paragraph 1.3.b describes the requirements for the Maintenance Support Services.  Since the Fingerprint Interface Server and the UPS products are not identified in the list of hardware to be supported, is it correct to assume that maintenance of those products is outside of the scope of work? ANSWER:  No.  Unfortunately, those items were left off of the PWS.  The FIS and UPS should be included in the list of hardware to be supported by maintenance. 7. QUESTION:  Performance Work Statement paragraph 1.3 (page 10):  Paragraph 1.3.b states "Licensed provider help desk will provide support for operational issues, trouble shooting assistance, technical consultation, and assistance with data analysis and reports. If licensed provider Help Desk is unable to answer specific questions, they will contact engineering support as needed to resolve issues."  Is it correct to assume that licensed provider is the Contractor's Level 1 help desk and if they are unable to answer a question then it is passed to our Level 2 Help Desk / Engineering support? ANSWER:  No.  It was written assuming that "licensed provider help desk" was LHM or alternative proposal help desk who would provide level 1 and 2 support and would then pass onto LHM level 3 engineering support if needed.  USMEPCOM Help Desk would attempt to resolve issue prior to passing off to LHM Help Desk. 8. QUESTION:  Section 508 Compliance Requirements (RFP page 20):  Paragraph 12.0 of the RFP identifies specific Section 508 compliance requirements.  Since this proposal is to maintain an already fielded hardware/software configuration, is it correct to assume that the Contractor is not required to evaluate each of the products in the fielded configuration, and if necessary, bring any non-compliant products up to Section 508 compliance? ANSWER:  Since each EFCS was fielded with an equipment stand that can be lowered or raised to various heights the assumption that the Contractor is not required to evaluate each of the products in the fielded configuration, and if necessary, bring any non-compliant products up to Section 508 compliance is correct. 9. QUESTION:  Manpower Reporting Requirements (RFP page 20):  Paragraph 13.0 of the RFP identifies manpower reporting requirements.  Is it correct to assume that manpower reporting would only be required for T&M task orders done under this contract, and would not be required for the Firm Fixed Price effort?  ANSWER:   No, the type of contract doesn't matter.  Manpower reporting is required for T&M as well as Firm Fixed Price.

<DESC>Description
1.     The 12th Contracting Squadron, Randolph AFB TX, has a requirement to Modify Interphone Audio Control Panale Simulator and Audio Control Boards with the attached Statement of Work (SOW).     This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and 13.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     This solicitation is issued as request for quotation (RFQ) number FA3089-06-T-0016.     This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.     The government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror submitting the quote that provides the best value to the government.     Award is contingent upon availability of funds. The associated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 336413; size standard 1,000 employees.

2.     The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, are applicable to this solicitation.     Interested parties may submit a written quote in accordance with FAR 52.212-1 and the attached CLIN structure.     Oral quotes will not be accepted.     Your quote should include your Cage Code, DUNS, and Tax Identification numbers.     To be eligible to receive an award resulting from this RFQ, contractors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, no exceptions.     To register, please visit http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.     Contractors must complete the Representations and Certifications in the ORCA database at http://www.bpn.gov/orca.       

3.     FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.     Addendum:     Basis for Award:     This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPT) procedures.     For proposals determined technically acceptable, a tradeoff between price and past performance will be conducted with past performance being significantly more important than price.     Offers shall propose on all items.     Only firm fixed price offers will be evaluated.     An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.     Quotes determined to be unreasonable or not compatible with the scope of effort or either excessive or insufficient for the effort to be accomplished will not be considered in the performance/price trade-off and will be ineligible for award. 

4.     The evaluation process will proceed as follows:     (a) Technical Acceptance:     By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all the terms, conditions, statement of work, and all other requirements of this solicitation and subsequent contract, and will be determined technically acceptable.     Any exception taken to the terms, conditions, or requirements will result in a determination of technical unacceptability; (b) Price:     Initially, all technically acceptable offers will be ranked according to price.     Reasonableness will be determined based on prices submitted by the competition, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate and prior acquisitions, if applicable.     Realism will be based on an evaluation of prices to determine if they are compatible with the scope of effort, are not unbalanced, and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished    c) Past Performance:   Using questionnaires, the contracting officer will seek relevant and recent performance information on all technically acceptable offers based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Recency:     To be considered recent, a contract shall have been performed during the past three years from the date of issuance of this posting.     Relevancy:     Relevant performance includes performance of work efforts that is similar or greater in scope and magnitude.     The following varying degrees of relevancy apply to this solicitation: Very Relevant	Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Relevant Present/past performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Somewhat Relevant Present/past performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.  Not Relevant Present/past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Offerors shall submit a minimum of 3 references, but no more than 5 overall of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers.     The offeror shall provide the attached past performance questionnaire to the reference and bear responsibility for ensuring that the reference provides the completed questionnaire to the point of contact identified in paragraph 11 of this posting by the deadline for offer submission.     Questionnaires submitted prior to the deadline for offer submission will be accepted.     The reference list should include, as a minimum: Contract Number, Description of Contract/Project Effort, Period of Performance, Contract Dollar Value, Name, Title, Current Address and Telephone Number of Contracting Officer and Quality Assurance Evaluator/Project Manager.
 
5.     The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this solicitation based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.     The agency will evaluate past performance in accordance with the criteria in paragraphs 4(c) through 8 of this solicitation.     The rating may be determined initially or as a result of discussions.     The confidence assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.     A trade-off process is then conducted.     The lowest price may not necessarily receive the award; likewise, the highest past performance rating may not necessarily receive the award.     A performance/price trade-off evaluation will not be conducted if only one acceptable offeror is received.     In this event, award will be made to the only technically acceptable quote received.     

6.     Overall confidence ratings are defined as follows: High Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has high confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Significant Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has significant confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Normal contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. Unknown Confidence: No performance record is identifiable. Little Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     No Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

7.     Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant and recent experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement may not be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.     Offerors with no relevant present or past performance history will receive a neutral rating, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.     However, a rating other than neutral may be assessed if the offeror proposes management personnel who have a record of performance on relevant contracts, or if a proposed subcontractor or partner who will be performing a significant portion of the work has a performance history on relevant contracts.     When relevant performance information indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised).     Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.     The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness.     The offeror may be notified of any adverse past performance information and given the opportunity to respond. 

8.     If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is determined to be reasonable and realistic, and is judged to have an overall high performance confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.     Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.     If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is not rated high confidence in the performance assessment, the next lowest priced, technically acceptable offer will be evaluated and the process will continue until an offeror whose price is reasonable and realistic is rated high confidence overall for past performance.     An integrated assessment will then be performed on all technically acceptable offerors whose past performance and price were evaluated, and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.     If no proposals are rated high confidence in the performance assessments, an integrated analysis will be accomplished on all technically acceptable proposals and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.

9.     The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price quote if that lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of very good or lower.     (2) If discussions will be conducted, all quotes will be evaluated and rated for performance risk.     The contracting officer will then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.     The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest price offeror if that lowest priced offeror.     The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.     Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit their most advantageous pricing in their initial response.     The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.       

10.     The following clauses and provisions are applicable to this solicitation:     FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items, FAR 52.219-1 Alt 1, Small Business Program Representations, FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside, DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications  Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, Addendum: Para (c) Changes is tailored as follows:     The contracting officer may modify the contract unilaterally under the following circumstances:     (a) to make administrative changes that do not affect the price or substantive terms; (b) to issue change orders or directions; or (c) to make changes authorized by clauses other than a changes clause, including but not limited to the Property clause, or Suspension of Work Clause.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>As mandated by Public Law 89-522 dated July 30, 1966, The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, Library of Congress (NLS), provides reading materials in recorded and braille formats to U.S. residents and U.S. citizens living abroad who are unable to use conventional print materials because of visual and physical limitations.  Each year, more than 23 million books and magazines are circulated to these groups.  Reading materials (books and magazines) are produced by contractors for NLS, and are distributed to a readership in excess of 700,000 through a network of over 135 regional and sub-regional libraries for blind and physically handicapped individuals.  States, municipalities, or other agencies operate these organizations.  In addition, books are distributed to schools, multi-state centers, and veterans’ hospitals throughout the nation and U.S. territories.  Currently, the Library of Congress requires the production of braille books in accordance with this IFB and the NLS Specifications #410 (Mailing Carton Labels) and #800 (Braille Books and Pamphlets) incorporated herein (Section J) and made a part hereof, and any “Special Instructions” issued with titles during performance of contract.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), through the Dahlgren Laboratory at Dahlgren, VA soliciting scientific and engineering research "white papers" to identify capabilities of University and Non-Profit Institutions to conduct basic research, applied research, and advanced research projects in a wide variety of scientific and engineering disciplines.    PLEASE NOTE: We are NOT seeking specific research proposals at this time – we are requesting submission of capability statements only.  Specific research proposals may be returned to the submitting institution with a request to submit a capability statement.   N00178-05-Q-3010 white papers will be considered as candidate sources until 30 Sept 2007.  N00178-04-Q-3021 white papers will be considered as candidate sources until 30 Sept 2006.  White papers submitted under BAA N00178-03-Q-3000 are no longer being considered. Research projects are expected to require a high level of technical expertise, primarily involving PhD level personnel; personnel requirements include, but are not limited to, the following categories: distinguished postdoctoral, senior postdoctoral, postdoctoral, professors, and graduate students.  Awards under this BAA are expected to take the form of grants, cooperative agreements, other transactions, or contracts.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710 -- Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences.   Representative research areas requiring scientific and engineering research expertise for which "white papers" (capability statements) are solicited include:   (a) Given the nature of today's war, it is imperative that measures are taken to ensure warfighter readiness by providing technology that takes into account the warfighter's cognitive capabilities and limitations for processing various types of information. NSWCDD is interested in research to further define the underlying mechanisms involved in the Executive Control Function (ECF) of attention with respect to cross-modal processing. In particular, it is of interest to identify the physiological correlates involved in attentional processing under cross-modal task paradigms. This will help to determine a baseline of performance under given conditions that vary as a function of task complexity, as well as assess how these attentional factors map to both behavioral and physiological variables. Furthermore, the behavioral characteristics for which individual differences (e.g., handedness, gender, etc.) mediate performance under these conditions should be investigated to further a!  ssess the regulatory function of the ECF. The results of this research will further the field of Cognition, in addition to providing a preliminary set of requirements for the design of systems which employ multimodal functionality.  (b) The goal of this effort is to explore research issues centered on uncovering the various mechanisms involved in knowledge representation and/or acquisition, language acquisition, cultural knowledge, and translation for the purpose of developing warfighter language capabilities by enhancing the knowledge and skills necessary for acquisition. Various means for enhancing warfighter knowledge and skills include the development of linguistic tools with varying functional capabilities, and the development of workshops to aid in skill acquisition. These factors will ultimately facilitate warfighter readiness through the acquisition of the necessary skills that enable high-level foreign language ability when sent abroad.  (c) Inhalational Anthrax in the Rabbit:  NSWCDD is interested in determining bacterial numbers, germination rates, toxin production, and antibody production in selected tissues and biological fluids of immunized and non-immunized rabbits following exposure to B. anthracis Ames spores via inhalation.  Targeted tissue/fluids include BAL, blood, lung homogenates, and lymph nodes. (d) Determination of sensory irritation in animal models - NSWCDD is interested in determining sensory irritation (RD50) for individual chemicals and mixtures of chemicals in animal models.  Targeted animal model preferred is rodents, but will also consider other models (e) High-power optical / material interactions including: Analysis of high heating rate linear and non-linear processes; Thermally induced material failure mechanisms; High-power optical absorption and scattering processes in materials and the atmosphere. Both theoretical and experimental research in this topic is of interest. (f) Technologies, evaluation methodologies, analysis techniques and test results for information transfer technologies applicable to navy shipboard use in areas that include but are not limited to, multicast communications, fault tolerance mechanisms, information assurance, wireless sensor networks, network resource management, and network time synchronization.  (g) Human-computer interaction at the individual, team and organizational levels to include advanced engineering tools, human performance and workload modeling and evaluation, decision aiding, remote/distributed team collaboration, advanced training technologies for the complex systems environment, and virtual environments.  Applications to unmanned systems (especially missiles, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles) is of particular interest.   (h) Next Generation Combat Systems, including: Distributed Combat System Capability in the Littorals - Model driven software development and evaluation; Modeling of the Littoral environment for the design of improved and optimized next generation sensors; Multi-Static Distributed Sensor System (MSDSS) for Networked Littoral Battlegroups; Integration of ISR data into the combat system; Weapons control systems for asymmetric threats in the littorals; Common time and navigation systems.  Systems of Unmanned Systems - Distributed Systems and Cooperative Group Behaviors; Robotics/Automation; Cooperating Autonomous Agents; Active Control Theory.  Automated Information Processing - Expert and Knowledge-based Systems; Automated Decision Processes; Tactics-based Search and Dynamic Mission Replanning; Intelligent Agents, Network Mobile Agents, and Adaptive Agents.  Distributed Computing - High performance and affordable distributed computing; High Bandwidth, Secure Communication Technology; Multi-modal, Mobile Human Network Intera!  ction (Virtual Environments) (i) A logic analyzer is a binary system used to verify various functions of computer systems.  NSWCDD would like to continue the development of a system to apply this readily available, low cost technology to weapons testing applications. Through previous work done at NSWCDD, it has been determined that to yield the clean signal required for accurate data logging by the Logic Analyzer, a high-voltage circuit must be used, along with signal conditioning circuitry. Also, in order to effectively use this many channels (hundreds in a given test), the velocity screens must be redesigned, and the manufacturing process for them must also be changed. A screen-printed velocity screen pattern printed onto 5-mil polyester sheets yields the ideal balance between flexibility of screen design, repeatability of screen design, and cost. This velocity screen manufacturing approach will make these screens plug-and-play in the field, and also leaves open the possibility of having custom-shaped patterns for velocity screen sectors. The work to be completed is described in the following paragraphs. There are three components to this data acquisition system; 1) The velocity screen, 2) The High Voltage circuitry, and 3) The post-processing algorithms and software. Development required on two portions of the system is discussed below. The HV Circuitry has been developed to yield a clean signal that produces very little cross-talk between channels. The work left on this involves designing the HV circuit for large-scale tests (i.e. hundreds of channels) and also designing the filter circuitry to isolate noise from the HV system into the Logic Analyzer. The post-processing algorithms have already been developed in spreadsheet format. It is desired that these algorithms be run through a GUI in a run-time environment, or on a computer program readily available on any computer (i.e. Microsoft Excel or other). The work left on this portion is the development of a GUI for both the test setup portion and the data processing portion. Finally, the system must be demonstrated to operate as a system in an explosive setting, incorporating the Logic Analyzer, velocity screens, HV circuitry, and post-processing software. (j) Automate the at-sea data reduction process by creating a user interface for the data collection system.  The at-sea data is generated using photography and the end data must be in a pre-specified format. Fall of Shot Measurement System (FOSMS) for Open Ocean Impact Scoring against Towed or Remote Control Targets collects images of target impacts on or near targets and calculates the miss distance at rapid continuous rates of fire for major caliber gun systems. The task would require familiarization with the process, equipment and data sets.  A thorough understanding of the various data sets is required to ensure the posttest data reduction algorithm adequately addresses missing or incomplete data. (k) A portion of the NSWCDD workload involves applied engineering, analysis, and design. The purpose of this project is to gain technical expertise in advanced modeling techniques in order to address Department of Defense critical needs.  We hope to gain expertise in critical technical areas to enhance our technical capabilities. Some of these problems require the use of advanced analysis tools such as state-of-the-art hydrocodes, finite element, and computational fluid dynamic codes.  The types of analyses include thermal, structural, modal, shock, composite materials analysis, and impact.  These problems are very complex and require expertise at the graduate student or professor level. Examples of the types of problems include the design and optimization of an automated/robotic hatch retraction mechanism for naval vessels, circuit design work for weapon launchers, the development of visualization software for weapon fire control console overlays, and human factors engineering to allow size limited crew to process extensive amounts of data in short periods of time. (l) The Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) is a high speed, highly maneuverable surface vessel that will be incorporated into the Fleet after calendar year 2007. Each Seaframe platform is designed to execute a specific mission and then be reconfigured for a different mission within a 24-hour period. This requirement for a rapidly reconfigurable platform has led to the design of a ship that will accommodate modularized mission packages that can be quickly installed and uninstalled at locations around the world. The potential warfighting capability that each Seaframe can bring with it into an area of engagement is proportional to the amount of weight that the overall Seaframe can accommodate. Currently, the Surface Warfare Mission Modules, gun and missile systems are being designed using standard engineering materials such as steel and aluminum. Judicious use of these materials in conjunction with detailed modeling and simulation has allowed the initial modules to meet their weight requirements. However, there is a strong desire to reduce the overall weight of mission modules in order to bring more firepower into any potential scenario. The scope of this task would be to understand the current mission module structural elements, their driving requirements such as stiffness and durability, environmental factors, shock, vibration, and others and from this information redesign these structural elements using lightweight composites. In order to achieve this goal, a full program of material testing and rigorous, non-linear modeling will need to be performed. It is envisioned that a number of preliminary candidate composite materials will be examined. A trade study of performance versus requirements will be undertaken. Then, with two or three of the top candidates identified, test specimens will be fabricated and from these test data model databases will be populated. After this small scale testing and in depth modeling and simulation have been completed, a final down-select will be made of the optimal material. Full-scale prototypes of the structural members will then be built and extensive testing will be performed to insure that the requirements have been met. As a threshold, it is hoped that an overall 25% weight savings will be achieved. A goal would be to reduce weight in excess of 50%. (m) Objective: Develop a methodology, analysis technique, or set of guidelines for performing safety assessments of safety critical software in an Open Systems Architecture (OSA) environment. Background:  Open Systems Architecture (OSA) is a systems design approach that seeks to implement open specifications for interfaces, services and supporting formats.  OSA will enable properly engineered components to be utilized across a wide range of systems, and to interoperate with components on local and remote systems, with minimal change requirements necessary.  In addition, OSA has become so attractive to the DoD acquisition community because of the promise of low upgrade and support costs.  However, there is no clear approach to software system safety assurance. Open System Definition:  Architecture is defined as “the structural design of an entity.”   By adding “openness” to the list of architectural characteristics implies that the “structure” of the architecture explicitly promotes interoperability, both internally and externally, as well as ease of modification and extension.  Open System is defined as a system that implements sufficient open specifications for interfaces, services, and supporting formats to enable properly engineered components to be utilized across a wide range of systems with minimal changes, to interoperate with other components on local and remote systems, and to interact with users in a style that facilitates portability.  Some key benefits that applied to the Open System to assure technical performance are: well-defined, widely used, non-proprietary standard interfaces, services, formats; standards that are developed by industrially recognized standards bodies; definition of system interfaces to facilitat!  e adding new or additional capabilities; explicit provision for expansion or upgrading through incorporation of additional or higher performance elements with minimal impact on the system; scalable, load invariant performance; reduced life-cycle cost and affordable COTS technology refresh; and reduced cycle time for changes and upgrades. (n) Provide support for developing and maintaining a cadre of active research scientists who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to Naval problems, to promote hiring and development of new scientists, and to encourage collaboration with universities, private industry, and other Navy and DON laboratories, in particular the corporate Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). Establish programs to create the next generation of Technologists at Naval R&D Centers; generate and sustain the interest and excitement of adolescents in careers in mathematics, physics, engineering and or other sciences, invigorate the science and math curricula, and enhance science and math training for teachers.  All white papers received will be maintained for a period not to exceed three years and will be considered as candidate sources for research projects during that period.  Offerors may replace, update, or withdraw white paper submissions at any time.  All white papers submitted for topics may be considered for research efforts at the Dahlgren Laboratory, the Coastal Systems Station, or the Combat Direction Systems Activity.   The Dahlgren Laboratory anticipate making multiple awards of grants, cooperative agreements, other transactions, or contracts.  When appropriate, research grants will be the preferred award method.  All white papers received that indicate interest in a particular research area will be reviewed for potential research projects in that area. Please identify the area in which your research is to be considered.  Selection of a source for each separate research project will be based primarily on "best match" of technical merit (offeror’s interest, expertise, and capability) and potential for contribution to accomplishment of Navy/DOD missions, as presented in the white papers and considering other relevant information available to the evaluator.  Anticipated cost will be considered in the selection, but cost will not be the primary determining factor.  The selected source for each project will be requested to submit a detailed proposal.

<DESC>This solicitation is unrestricted and open to participation by all interested firms with specialized experience and qualifications required by this project. This procurement will result in the award of a firm fixed-price design/build construction contract for repairs to the Trident Refit Facility (TRF) Drydock located at Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, GA. The project is a corrosion control project. The facility consists of the Drydock cover/structure, the Drydock basin, and six ancillary buildings. The drydock cover/structure is a large, partially enclosed, metal clad structure composed of structural steel members. It is 825’ long by 236’ at the base. The facility also includes a 300’ open lay down area to the north of the enclosed portion of the structure. The frames are a truss-bent configuration, generally spaced at 25’ intervals. The roof girder is a 210’, 10-panel Pratt truss with a sloping top chord. It is supported on each side by a vertical truss consisting of 2 main columns and a crane column. These steel columns are supported on a concrete pedestal that rises 4’ above the cope deck. The ancillary buildings are masonry building with metal cladding. The existing structural steel in the drydock cover/structure from an elevation of 33’ (16’ above the cope deck) has experienced corrosion damage. This project requires the contractor to remove all coatings on all structural framing members above Elevation 33’ to a SSPC SP 10 specification and to apply a new epoxy polyamide coating system. In addition, corroded bolts, gusset plates, and pipe support rods shall be replaced. The metal wall panels on all buildings shall be patched, lower flashing replaced, and the exterior wall panels shall be pressure-washed to SSPC SP 12 specification and coated per the 09900 specification. The project will require scaffolding and containment for capturing all coating removal debris, dust, and paint spray. Contractor shall maintain temperature and humidity control during surface preparation, coating application, and initial curing. The project also requires working at heights greater than 100’ above water and/or finished grade. Contractor SHALL be certified to SSPC-QP1. This work will be performed in a Waterfront Restricted Area, therefore the project contains several WORK RESTRICTIONS and SECURITY RESTRICTIONS. Due to the importance of the Drydock facility to national security, the project has a very AGGRESSIVE MANDATORY SCHEDULE, with contract award on or around May 15, 2006 and construction completion of Aug 2, 2007. The project shall be conducted in two phases with separate LD’s for each Phase. Phase 1 shall occur during an operational shutdown of the facility and Phase 2 shall be conducted while the Drydock is in service. The estimated price range is between $12,000,000-$13,966,000 with a completion date of Aug 2, 2007. The NAICS Code is 238320 with a size standard of $12,000,000. This is a negotiated source selection procurement that consists of the submission of technical and price proposals. The source selection process to be used is Best Value Trade-Off Approach. Award will be made to the offeror whose total price and technical proposal offers the best value to the government. This will be an electronic solicitation, which can be downloaded from ESOL at http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil. The solicitation should be available at this site on or about February 13, 2006. Proposals will be due on or about March 30, 2006. Attendance to the Pre-Proposal Conference and Site Visit on or around March 02, 2006 IS MANDATORY. The solicitation package will provide exact dates.

<DESC>The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, on behalf of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation to extend and expand the scope of their current contract for an additional five years. The Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation was originally awarded a contract for a five and one half year period in September 1995 for a project entitled "Lupus Multiplex Registry and Repository." In April 2001, a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) approved the extension and expansion of the Registry and Repository for another five and one-half years (April 1, 2001 through September 29, 2006). The purpose of the contract was to establish a registry and repository to characterize multiplex lupus pedigrees in order to accelerate progress in establishing and identifying the genes and gene products. The contractor has successfully established a registry of lupus pedigrees, operated a repository of sera, cells and DNA, and conducted the genotyping of the pedigrees enrolled. The purpose of this extension is to enlarge the available collections of multiplex pedigrees, with emphasis on African American, Native American, and Hispanic families. In performing this expanded work scope, the Contractor will continue collecting pedigrees multiplex for systemic lupus erythematosus at a pace to equal or exceed 150 per year, of which at least 40% will be non-European American and nuclear family members. The Contractor will continue to 1) genotype these pedigrees, 2) store DNA, clinical information, lupus serology, plasma, and serum sufficient to support the work of approved and potential users, 3) evaluate applications from potential users, and 4) distribute these materials to approved users. A substantial portion (>24%) of these pedigrees will be African American.  Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302 1, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation is the only source capable of performing this requirement due to their prerequisite knowledge and experience because of their preliminary and current work. Due to the inherent duplication of cost and unacceptable delays in performance, a noncompetitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements, as described above.  A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is a RFP available. See Numbered Note 22.

1	Background
The 480th Intelligence Wing (480th IW) at Langley AFB, VA operates the GeoWorx Production Systems for the production of Air Force Controlled Image Base (AFCIB).  GeoWorx is an ortho-image production system developed by General Dynamics – Advanced Information Systems (GDAIS) to produce CIB and AFCIB to National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) standards. The 480th IW produces AFCIB in direct support of the Air Force Mission Planning and War Fighter communities.
Three GeoWorx Production Systems are planned for continued operation in the coming years.  The production sites are (1) the 36th IS at Langley AFB, Virginia, (2) the 152nd ANG at Reno Nevada, and (3) the 20th IS at Offutt AFB, Nebraska.  The 36th IS system is comprised of eight (8) SUN workstations, the 152nd ANG system is comprised of three (3) SUN workstations, and the 20th IS system is comprised of six (6) SUN workstations.  Each system is served from a SUN V880.  The systems operate Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) applications.  
The services provided hereunder will be priced on a Firm, Fixed-Price basis.

5.3  Travel 
Travel shall be required to accomplish the requirements of this SOW. Actual expenses are limited by the Government Joint Travel Regulations and must be pre-approved by the client.   Travel of personnel between Contractor offices outside the local areas and the place of performance is authorized in accordance with the program management plan not to exceed the specified travel allowance.  Any additional travel will be fully coordinated with the Government Project Manager prior to conduct of the travel to ensure funding and approvals are obtained.  Where feasible, teleconferencing and electronic media transfers of data shall be used as much as possible to limit travel costs.  The  least expensive form of travel shall be sought as is practical to the fulfillment of the performance of the task order.


5.5 Procedure for Payment
The contractor shall provide original invoices to the address shown on Block 24 of the GSA Form 300.  The following clauses ares incorporated into the task or contract:

Invoices shall be provided after the acceptable delivery of items as designated in Section 6.0. Only one invoice per month per order/contract shall be provided.  The appropriate GSA office will receive the invoice by the twenty-fifth calendar day of the month after  the end of the month in which the products (commodities) or deliverables (fixed-priced services) were delivered and accepted by the Government.
 
All required documentation shall be provided (unless exempted by the contract or order) as follows:

For Travel: Submit the traveler's name, dates of travel, location of travel, and dollar amount of travel.

For ODCs:  Submit a description of the ODC, quantity, unit price and total price of each ODC.

Note: The Government reserves the right to audit, thus; the contractor shall keep on file all backup support documentation for travel and ODCs.

Posting Acceptance Documents:  Invoices shall initially be submitted through GSA’s electronic Web-Based Order Processing System, currently ITSS, to allow the client and GSA COTR to electronically accept and certify services received by the CR.  Included with the invoice will be all backup documentation required such as, but not limited to, travel authorizations and training authorizations (including invoices for such).   

Receiving Agency’s Acceptance:  The receiving agency has the following options in accepting and certifying services;
a.	Electronically:  The client agency may accept and certify services electronically via GSA’s electronic Web-Based Order Processing System, currently ITSS, by accepting the Acceptance Document generated by the contractor.  Electronic acceptance of the invoice by the CR is considered concurrence and acceptance of services.  NOTE:  The Government’s preference is that receiving agency’s acceptance is conducted electronically.
b.	On Paper Copy:  The client agency may accept and certify services by providing written acceptance with the signature of the authorized client representative and the date of acceptance.
Electronic and/or written acceptance of the invoice by the CR is considered concurrence and acceptance of services.  Regardless, of the method of acceptance the contractor shall seek acceptance and electronically post the acceptance document in GSA’s electronic Web-based Order Processing System, currently ITSS.  (Written acceptances will be posted as an attachment along with any other supporting documentation.)  After acceptance of the invoice by the CR,  a proper invoice shall be submitted to GSA Finance not later than five (5) workdays after acceptance by the Government of the product, service, and/or cost item.  In the absence of Government acceptance within thirty (30) days, the contractor shall submit an invoice.

Note:  The acceptance of the authorized agency customer representative is REQUIRED prior to the approval of payment for any invoiced submitted.  Although this acceptance may occur in two ways, electronically or in paper copy, it at least shall be obtained prior to the approval of payment.  In order to expedite payment, it is strongly recommended that the receiving agency’s WRITTEN acceptance of all the services or products delivered be continued to be provided, with signature of the authorized agency customer representative and the date of acceptance, as part of the submission documentation.  

Note: If any invoice is received without the required documentation, (A) the customer's signed written acceptance OR (B) the customer’s electronic acceptance, the invoice shall be rejected in whole or in part as determined by the Government.  

Posting Invoice Documents: Invoices shall be submitted to GSA Finance for payment, after acceptance has been processed in GSA’s electronic Web-Based Order Processing System, currently ITSS.   GSA provides the option of posting the invoice on GSA’s Ft. Worth web site, www.finance.gsa.gov/defaultexternal.asp  or mail to the address shown on BLOCK 24 of the GSA FORM 300.  NOTE:  Only use one method of submission, web site or regular U.S. mail, but not both.

Requests shall be directed to GSA for an extension for final invoices that may exceed the 60-day time frame.

•	The Government Client Representative will review and certify contractor invoices for accuracy and validity.
•	The GSA Invoice Support Staff or a GSA ITM will review the labor categories, labor rates, labor expenditures, travel expenditures, and ODC expenditures reflected in the contractor’s invoice and ensure that the invoice aligns with the task order proposal and does not exceed the ceiling value.     


8. Inspection and Acceptance 
 The CR shall have the responsibility to review all deliverables associated with this task and the GSA Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) shall review and accept or reject the deliverables.  The Government shall have 15 workdays to complete the review of each final deliverable and accept or reject each of them in writing.  The COTR will have the right to reject or require correction to any deliverables that do not meet the requirements of the SOW or are found to be contrary to the information contained in the contractor’s accepted proposal.  In the event of a rejected deliverable, the COTR will provide notification in writing as for the specific reasons why the deliverable has been rejected.  The Government will provide 10 business days, or as requested by the client representative, to correct the rejected deliverable and return it to the COTR.

<DESC>The Epidemiology Branch is one of three intramural Branches within the Division of Epidemiology, Statistics and Prevention Research at the National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD).  The Epidemiology Branch conducts original research on all aspects of reproductive, perinatal and pediatric epidemiology using a variety of study designs and methods.  

The Epidemiology Branch intends to empirically evaluate the relation between select environmental chemicals and the gynecologic disorders in the context of varying comparison groups.  The goal of this reproductive epidemiologic study is to identify environmental contaminants that may adversely affect gynecologic health with a particular focus on endometriosis.  The specific exposures of interest include persistent hormonally active environmental agents (e.g., polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbon chemicals such as PCBs), persistent organochlorine pesticides (OCs), and newly emerging persistent compounds (e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluorinated chemicals (PFOS, PFOA).  Biomarkers of lifestyle factors purportedly associated with risk of endometriosis (e.g., cotinine, phytoestrogens) also will be assessed.  Menstruating women, aged 18-44 years (women at risk of developing endometriosis), of any racial/ethnic group comprise the target study population.  Although it is possible for men on hormonal therapy to develop and be diagnosed with endometriosis, the rarity of the condition among men and its appearance only in the presence of hormonal therapy makes their inclusion in this study impractical.  Likewise, minor girls are unlikely to eligible given that adolescents are rarely diagnosed because affected individuals generally do not undergo laparoscopy for several years following the onset of signs and symptoms.

The many complexities associated with the diagnosis of endometriosis (such as laparoscopic visualization with or without histologic confirmation and the selectiveness of women seeking gynecologic medical care in comparison to the target study population) pose methodologic challenges for assessing the etiology of endometriosis including environmental contaminants.  To this end, the two comparison groups of women will be studied to facilitate interpretation of the study results.   

Study participants will be sampled from women undergoing diagnostic/therapeutic laparoscopy or laparotomy.  To ensure sufficient power to detect differences in serum concentrations, approximately 850 women undergoing laparoscopy/laparotomy will need to complete the study protocol, of which half will comprise women with newly diagnosed endometriosis.  An additional 187 population controls also will be needed to serve as a second comparison group.  



The NICHD is soliciting proposals from qualified organizations that wish to serve as a site for the conduct of this study.  The NICHD anticipates that up to two sites will be needed to meet the overall recruitment goals.  Therefore, the NICHD plans on issuing up to two contract awards for 27-month completion-type contracts, with two separate Phases, for this procurement.    

Each site will be expected to successfully enroll and retain: 1) women in whom endometriosis is newly diagnosed either by laparoscopy or laparotomy; 2) women undergoing laparoscopy or laparotomy in whom no endometriosis is diagnosed including women undergoing tubal sterilization without underlying gynecologic disease; and 3) women randomly selected from the referent population for women in the laparoscopy/laparotomy cohort who report no history of endometriosis or other gynecologic disease.  

This procurement is defined as code 541710 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or about February 21, 2006 through the FedBizOpps website at http://FedBizOpps.gov.  

All proposals must be submitted on or before the due date and time stated in the RFP to: Gwennifer Epps, Contract Specialist, NICHD R&D Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6l00 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Rockville Maryland, 20852).

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) seeks to modify an existing contract, No. PBGC01-CT-04-0685 with Booz Allen & Hamilton (BAH) who is currently developing the Case Administration System (CAS) redesign.  This work is the continuation of services to provide re-engineering/developing services, sustaining engineering or maintenance services, and operational and production support services for a suite of approximately eight PBGC custom-designed software applications.  There’s a need to increase the estimated level of effort which will meet management’s requirements and schedule for this project. The increased level of effort will allow for additional personnel to:  (1) expedite the development of the CAS redesign. The software development will utilize the FileNet P8 business process management (BPM) product to redesign the current CAS suite of applications into one BPM tool. The current CAS suite of applications will be redesigned into one application – Case Management System (CMS); and (2) enhance the User Provisioning Tool (UPT) to incorporate functionality and improve performance.  The UPT is a security tool developed to leverage the Service Oriented Architecture at PBGC to control access to applications and plan information.   It is in the best interest of the PBGC for the current provider to complete this work by modifying the existing contract which will ensure continuity of work and accuracy in the execution.  This is not a request for proposal.  See Note 22.

<DESC>Solicitation Number SP0935-06-R-R004

TOTAL NUMBER OF NSNs:  49
ANNUAL EST. DOLLAR VALUE:  $195,146.00
5 YEAR EST. DOLLAR VALUE:  $975,733.00
EST. MAXIMUM CONTRACT LIMIT:  $4,878,667.00

This requirement is for the procurement of QPL items procurable only from approved sources.  The scope of the contract, regardless of the awardee, is to procure QPL items only from the approved QPL source(s). There are 49 QPL items in this project.  Federal Supply Classes include, but are not limited to 5905, 5935, 5945, and 5962.

The NSNs in this acquisition are limited to items in which the Government does not possess complete technical data to support full and open competition.  It is highly unlikely that technical data will be developed to support full and open competition during the life of the contract.

The solicitation is for an Indefinite Quantity Contract for one (1) basic year with options to extend the contract for four (4) additional years at one (1) year increments, utilizing Firm-Fixed-Price with Priced Options.  Single or split awards are anticipated, however, Clause L15D01- All or None (DSCC 52.215-9C01) is included, thus awards will be made on an all or none basis for each contract line item (CLIN). 

Clause H15D01, Addition/Deletion of Items on Schedule is included in contract to accommodate future NSN add-ons that are within the scope of contract, or deletion of items in the contract that may alter the value of the contract.  All 49 NSNs are managed by the Defense Supply Center Columbus (S9C). 

The solicitation allows for the procurement of items to meet coverage for stock requirements.  It incorporates provisions to process electronic transmission of delivery orders against the basic contract and for contractors electronic submission of invoices.

Evaluation Criteria:  Offers are evaluated using provisions of Clause M15D04:  price, offered delivery, S&S, Option, socio-economic and mentoring plan capabilities, and Javitts-Wagner-O'Day Submittal as they apply.  

The intent is to synopsize the items in the FedBizOps 15 days prior to the issuance of solicitation. 

MARKET RESEARCH:
Background:

Past procurements were reviewed to determine prior source(s), prices paid, and deliveries of the NSNs in this package.   Prior contractors who had supplied the items in the past will be solicited.  

METHOD OF ACQUISITION:
In the absence of adequate price competition, and if price reasonableness determination is not reached, proposed price(s) will be negotiated with the offeror(s).
The following are the NSNs planned for this solicitation:

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Product Manager, Force Protection Systems (PM-FPS), has a reprocurement requirement for the installation and testing of the Integrated Commercial Intrusion Detection System-IV (ICIDS-IV).  This announcement provides notification of a planned rele ase of a draft Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about February 10, 2006 for the site survey, site design, site preparation, commercial equipment installation, engineering support, training and technical manuals, testing, acceptance, and warranty of ICIDS- IV.   The ICIDS-IV is a detection system used to monitor designated areas and facilities on and around an installation.  When unauthorized attempts to enter these areas and facilities are detected, the ICIDS-IV provides alarms for operators to take require d action.  The objective of the ICIDS program is to provide a standard configuration for military installations.  ICIDS-IV consists of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) equipment, to include interior and exterior sensors, Primary Monitor Consoles (PMC), Remo te Status Monitors (RSM), Remote Area Data Collectors (RADC), Closed Circuit TV (CCTV), and Entry Control Equipment (ECE).   The requirement is intended to be a fixed price indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract with a base year and four (4) opti on years.   	Instructions for accessing the Draft RFP consisting of Statement of Work (SOW), proposal instructions, and evaluation criteria for industry comment will be available on the FedBizOpps web site at http://www.fbo.gov on or about 10 Feb 06.   Hard copy reque sts may be accepted on or after this date.  The final solicitation that incorporates any changes as a result of industry responses to the draft solicitation is expected to be issued on or before 31 March 2006.  Contract award is anticipated to occur in the  1st Qtr 2007, government fiscal year.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 561621 and the size standard is $10.5M.  The minimum dollar value for the total requirement is $1.2M.  The maximum total value over the five year period could be $200M. Experience gained during ICIDS-I through ICIDS-III demonstrated difficulties with the current approach related to site survey, site preparation and installation.  These difficulties have led to numerous contract modifications to extend the delivery date an d increase cost.  In responding to the draft RFP, the government is intent on obtaining industry recommendations for mitigating these performance risks through innovative management and possibly incentives.  Additionally, based on the SOW, contractors shou ld recommend labor categories to accomplish the technical effort. Following the review of comments received from the Draft RFP, the Government will update its documents and release the RFP.  Consequently, to ensure participation in the competition, you sho uld respond to the Draft RFP, although a follow-on synopsis will precede the release of the final RFP.

The contractor shall be required to provide copies of State/local inspection reports and permits for all producers plants.  The contractor shall be required to provide periodic reports relative to hiring and subcontracting in the disaster location to monitor compliance with the Stafford Act.  Time is of the essence in performance of this contract, as this ice is required to sustain life in the aftermath of disasters that have or will disrupt the normal source of refrigeration in the disaster location.  Therefore, this contract requires immediate response, with timely production, delivery, and reporting by the Contractor.  The Contractor may be required to respond to simultaneous disasters with deliveries to multiple sites for each disaster.  In order to meet the intent of the Stafford Act, the Contractor shall give preference to the extent feasible and practicable in meeting its subcontracting and hiring requirements with those organizations, firms, and individuals residing or doing business p rimarily in the area affected by the disaster.

The Evaluation Factors for this procurement are as follows:  EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD  	1. Proposal Evaluation and Source Selection Procedures.  		a. The Government will evaluate proposals utilizing Best Value Source Selection Procedures and award will be made to the offeror that the Government determines can accomplish the requirements set forth in this Request for Proposal (RFP) in a manner most advantageous to the Government, cost or price and other factors considered. The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest price offer after consideration of all evaluation factors.  		b. The evaluation factors for the Technical Proposal, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.  However, the importance of price could become greater depending on the technical equality of the proposals, and all prices must be fair and  reasonable. Where competing technical proposals are determined to be substantially equal, price would become the controlling factor in making the contract award.  	2. Evaluation Factors.  		a. Technical Proposals. Each technical proposal submitted in response to this RFP will be evaluated based on the factors listed below.  Evaluation Factors 1 and 2 are of equal value and  are of more importance than Factor 3.  	For Evaluation Factor 1, subfactors are of equal importance.

<DESC>This requirement is for a new high precision supersonic wind tunnel Model Injection System (MIS) mechanism shall be fabricated, shop assembled  and tested, disassembled and shipped to site, installed and tested at the  site.  A detailed design and specification package for the MIS will be  provided by the Government.  The demolition of an existing MIS mechanism  is also included in this contract The demolition and installation work  shall be performed at Arnold Air Force Base, Tennessee. The new MIS mechanism is a high precision positioning system used to  locate and orient test models in supersonic tunnel test section under a  wide variation of aerodynamic loads.  The overall dimensions of the new  MIS are 18'-4" high x 5'-5" wide x 9'-10" long and it weighs approximately  15,000 lbs. The MIS consists of multiple components and equipment.  Some of the key  fabricated and machined components are described below. The axial frame is a large welded and bolted structure that requires  accurate machining of long surfaces.  Four linear rails bolt directly to  the axial frame and must be oriented in near perfect parallelism, the  machining of the rail mounting surfaces is critical.  The frame sections  measure approximately 15 ft x 7 ft and require machining accuracies of  0.003” on some surfaces. The sector assembly contains the Carriage Segment Gear which is a curved  track with an integral gear segment.  It is a highly precise part with a  radius of approximately 7 ft.  The 12 diametral pitch spur gear segment  contains 2000 teeth.  The edges of the track are precision ground with  case hardened surfaces for the pitch carriage rollers to ride upon. The roll mechanism is a high torque, highly precise gear box.  It requires  precision machining and grinding of round parts (turning) with required  accuracies as rigid as .0003”. The MIS also includes control systems such as the balancing system and  associated air circuit components, control cabinets, and control feedback  devices The demolition and installation work shall be performed in an existing  pressure tank located below the wind tunnel test section.  The pressure  tank is a welded steel pressure shell with the approximate dimensions of  14’L x 10’W x 25’D.  All demolition and installation materials must be  removed from the tank thru an existing door which is approximately 72”  wide x 79” high and is located at an elevation of 14’ above the bottom of  the tank. All work shall be completed within 15 months after contract award.  For more information on "Model Injection System", please refer to:  http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixs_solicitation.asp?id=4136

<DESC>The following questions and answers are hereby incorporated into the combined synopsis/solicitation:   Question 1:  Under objective one,  there is a request for consultation with the Center for School  Improvement.   Will this require face to face meetings?  If so,  approximately how many trips and for what duration?  Answer 1.

And for Objective two, the meeting will be  face to face to provide (25) days, 1-2  days per trip.   Question 2:  Task  2A lists a requirement to facilitate focus groups.  Is the contractor  responsible for organizing and leading focus groups?  If so:  Ho many  groups?  Approximately how many individuals per group?  How often will  groups meet?  Where will focus groups meet?  What work will they be  expected to do and will this include a stipend for work done by focus  group members?  Answer 2. Yes, the contractor will be responsible for  leading focus groups.  There will be 2 focus groups, with about 12 people  representing the 3 regions.  The groups will meet 4 times, and the focus  groups will meet in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  The groups will analyze  resulting data related to the components of the coordination of services  for students with disabilities.  There will be no stipend for the group.    Question 3:  With respect to the data collection requirement under Task  2A:  will this be done primarily from a distance, is on site required, or  would this be a combination of on-site and distance communication?  If on  site, will the data be a sampling or involve travel to all BIA schools?     Answer 3.  Data collection will be gathered from a distance, from  appropriate OIEP/Division of Compliance, Monitoring and Accountability  (DCMA) (formerly CSI), line office and local school personnel as it  relates to the coordination of service for students with disabilities.    Question 4.  Under Task 2B, the contractor is required to assist with  development of materials for the Memorandum of Agreement.   Could you be  more specific as to the requirements for this subtask and its associated  travel requirements?    Answer 4.  The contractor will need to develop a  power point presentation, information materials, and brochures describing  the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between IHS and OIEP, which will be used  for information training sessions to our three regional offices and to the  12 IHS Area Offices.  The travel required will be in consultation face to  face with staff at the DCMA for a total of 10 days, 1-2 days per trip.  Question 5:  required qualifications state provider must be willing to do  extensive travel to native American communities.   Task 1D requires 6 days  training, Task 2B requires 10 days training.   I have posed questions  above with respect to focus groups and consultation with CSI that address  travel.   Aside from those requirements, is there other travel to  communities for which the contractor needs to plan?  Answer 5.  There are  no other days that the contractor will have to travel to Indian  communities.   All other terms and conditions shall remain in full force  and effect.

<CONTACT>Micky Mayes, Contracting Officer, Phone 312-886-8820, Fax 312-886-3827, Email micky.mayes@gsa.gov
<DESC>The General Services Administration’s Federal Technology Service, Region 5 Chicago, on behalf of the U.S. Air Force Electronic Systems Center (ESC) Forces Protection Squadron, is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) in order to identify companies having the technology, qualification and capabilities to provide Hand Held and Desktop Explosion Detection Equipment for over 200 Air Force installations both Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental States (OCONUS).  Capabilities/qualifications submitted in response to this RFI will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses will be evaluated for their viability.  The determination of procurement strategy, based upon the responses to this RFI, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All sources may submit a response, which will be considered by the government.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to publish any information provided by a respondent to the RFI if publishing such information is done without attribution (i.e., does not identify the party submitting the response materials), and would not reveal company trade secrets or other similar protected or proprietary information.  For example, if a respondent were to ask when the draft RFP would be released, then such a question could be published without attribution and would not jeopardize any corporate or trade secrets of the respondent.  Accordingly, the Government may publish such materials.  On the other hand, if a respondent were to provide detailed product rollout plans for a new device, then that material would not be published if properly marked.

We invite comments/information on the following:
•	A respondent’s commercial-off-the-shelf product(s) and capability(-ies) to meet the requirements as drafted in the attached technical requirements document.  
•	Whether the above products and capabilities are currently available on an established Government contract (i.e., GSA FSS Schedule).
•	Whether the above products and capabilities are currently available on the open market.
•	Typical pricing structure for Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.  Specifically, what is included in the unit price of the explosive detection device/equipment and what is priced separately?  For example, does the unit price of an explosive detection device/equipment include installation, manuals, training, technical support, upgrades, extended warranties, etc.
•	Client references to other Government Agency POC's with in-depth experience procuring similar devices.
•	Industry Performance Parameters and Measures of Performance/Standards for Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.  Please provide the Government with information and advice regarding recognized Government and/or Industry standards to describe the detailed technical capabilities of handheld and desktop explosives detection equipment.   The Government is especially interested in standards that might be used to describe the capabilities of such equipment generically, using the standard itself as a qualifying parameter for equipment procured, without going into the potentially classified details of the equipment's capabilities.  The Government's intent is to be able to specify the technical requirements of such devices by requiring compliance with a standard (that may itself contain detailed classified information) in a procurement that contains no specifically classified details in either the requirement statement or the resultant proposals. 
•	Security Classifications for Explosive Detection Equipment standards or performance capabilities.
•	Common commercial practices and standards for warranty coverage applicable to Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.  For example, what is and is not covered under the warranty(-ies)?  What is the duration of the warranty period?  Are extended warranties common and available for this equipment?
•	Common commercial practices and standards for preventative maintenance (i.e., How much preventative maintenance for explosive detection equipment is required?  Is this typically carried out end users or under maintenance agreements with the manufacturer or other service provider?).
•	Common commercial practices and standards regarding end user training on the use and maintenance of Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.
•	Management and operations associated with delivery of equipment, quality control, scheduling, training and technical support to include domestic and overseas locations. 
•	Contractor’s and/or potential subcontractors’ status as a small business, veteran owned small business, -HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, women-owned small business.
•	Proprietary Information.  Indicate specifically whether the response includes proprietary information, and which information should be considered proprietary.  Requirements for marking proprietary information are in FAR Subsection 3.104.  Note:  See FAR Subsection 3.104-4 for how this information will be safeguarded, if properly labeled.
This RFI is being issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the RFI.  Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and the Government’s use of such information.

<DESC>Outreach for Operation and Maintenance of the
Chevelon Houses and RV sites
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests
Black Mesa Ranger District
Navajo County, AZ


Purpose

The purpose of this Outreach Notice is to determine the potential application pool for operating and maintaining a Ranger Station that is no longer needed by the Forest Service.  The site is known as the Chevelon Houses and RV sites. The sites are located on the Black Mesa Ranger District, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests.  The authorized officer for this offering is Elaine Zieroth, Forest Supervisor, P.O. Box 640, Springerville, Arizona 85938.   The Forest Vicinity Map displays the general location of the facilities.

Submitting a Response

Interested parties should compile a short (one page or less) response that indicates their name and address, type of affiliation (individual, corporation, state government, etc.), description of proposed use, the expected users and public benefits.  Responses will help determine the type of prospectus to be advertised. The outreach will provide the Forest Service a list of interested parties to solicit applications from for issuance of a special-use permit for operation and maintenance of the site. The permit holder will be responsible for applicable use fees, marketing, reservation management, fee collection and property management of the Chevelon Housing and RV sites.  

Written responses must be submitted to the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests, Attention:  Kate Klein, P.O. Box 968, Overgaard, AZ 85933.  The response must be received no later than February 22, 2006.

Overview of Opportunity

The site is a Forest Service administrative site that was previously operated as a Ranger Station. The Forest Service no longer utilizes the facilities.  The permit holder may be authorized to use all government owned facilities and infrastructure under the terms of the special use permit.  The permit holder will be responsible for operation and maintenance of all the facilities including the water and sewage system.  The permit fee may be offset in whole or in part by the value of Government maintenance and reconditioning, according to Granger-Thye fee offset regulations.

Facilities being offered in this prospectus are 3 houses, 2 duplexes, 12 RV sites, 11 apartments, one 1700 sq. foot office and approximately 8,000 sq. ft. of workshops/garages/storage buildings.  

The Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests, administered as one National Forest from the Supervisor’s Office in Springerville, encompass two million acres of magnificent mountain country in east-central Arizona.  The high, cool elevation of the Mogollon Rim and the string of man-made lakes in the ponderosa pine forest are within a 45 minute drive of the sites covered by this prospectus.  The Mogollon Rim is a dramatic 1000-foot escarpment that is the southern boundary of the Colorado Plateau.

The facilities are located approximately 45 miles south of Winslow via a paved road and about 35 miles north of Woods Canyon Lake via graveled roads.  The sites are located at an elevation of approximately 7,000 feet in ponderosa-pine vegetation type.

The major recreation activities in the summer and fall are driving for pleasure, camping, picnicking, fishing, mountain biking, boating, horseback riding, hiking, photography, hunting, viewing wildlife and fall colors.  Winter offers sledding, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling and ice fishing.  The Forest provides good habitat for a wide variety of wildlife species, such as elk, deer, antelope, black bear, turkeys, songbirds and small mammals.  Fishing is a major attraction on the lakes near the area.

Temperatures during the summer are relatively mild, averaging from 50° to 75° during the day.  Nighttime temperatures average about 45°.  July and August are typically rainy months, with daily afternoon thunderstorms.  Late August and September temperatures average about 60°, with lows at night around 25° to 30°.  The area receives approximately 20 inches of precipitation in the form of snow and rain.

Interested parties are encouraged to consult with District persons listed below regarding questions related to the offerings in this outreach, permit conditions, operations and maintenance of the site, or other related items.

The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asian Republics is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with country offices in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.    Central Asia is bordered by Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan.  Due to its substantial oil and gas reserves, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.  

The Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible for the strategic planning, program design and implementation, achievement of results, and reporting for the USAID assistance programs for the five Central Asian republics.  The U.S. Government’s program of assistance in the region is focused on the growth of small-scale enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources, including energy; and improved primary healthcare.  It ranks as one of the Agency’s largest programs, with funding levels that have averaged over $139 million annually.  The Mission implements its programs together with more than 80 contractor and grantee teams.  The staff manages a program that addresses six Strategic Objectives (SO) principally focused on assisting these former communist states in making the transition to Western-style democracies with viable market economies.

The Mission currently has three technical offices: Office of Economic Growth (OEG), Democracy and Conflict Mitigation (DM), and Health and Education (HE) and is in the process of designing the 2007-2011 Strategy.  Under the 2000-2006 Strategy, the Office of Economic Growth (OEG) is responsible for the management of a large portfolio which comprises of two Strategic Objectives, SO1.3 – An Improved Environment for the Growth of Small and Medium Enterprises with three intermediate results (IRs)

•	More responsive financial institutions, instruments, and markets (IR 1.3.2)
•	Increased implementation of laws and regulations (IR 1.3.3)

And SO 1.6 Improved Management of Critical Natural Resources, Including Energy, with IRs: 

•	Increased management capacity in the natural resources sector (IR 1.6.1)
•	Improved Policy and Regulatory Framework for Natural Resources Management (IR 1.6.2)
•	Sustainable Models Developed for Integrated Natural Resources Management (IR 1.6.3)
•	Public Commitment Established for Natural Resources Management Policies (IR 1.6.4)

<CONTACT>Carmen Bernhardt Purchasing Agent 7022938601     CBernhardt@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to Mr. Robert Mullion, dba Red River Farms, for approximately eight-six (86) irrigable acres to provide farming and irrigation services at the Cibola Valley Conservation Area (CVCA), located near Cibola, Arizona. Purpose of Contract The purpose of this contract will be to perform farming and irrigation services at the CVCA, located near Cibola, Arizona. Interested parties will be required to submit a proposal that details the cost estimates for the following items; disking, spraying, seeding, leveling, and irrigation.  Term of Contract The term of this contract will be no more than 12 months from the date of award. 2. Services to be Performed Task 1 - Irrigation Work will include irrigating cottonwood-willow a minimum of sixteen (16) waterings per year on CVCA Phase I. The exact irrigation schedule will be determined by Reclamation personnel. The irrigation schedule will vary due to variable conditions, e.g., weather conditions, pumping capacity, soil infiltration rates. Task 2 - Farming Services Work will include preparing the fields for planting and maintenance of the native plants after planting. Land preparation may include disking, leveling, weed eradication, and cover crop seeding, as determined by Reclamation personnel. Other services may include spot replacement planting, weed eradication, spraying, and trimming, as determined by Reclamation personnel. 3. Special Considerations "	The surrounding fields are under contract agreement between a local farmer and the Mohave County Water Authority, the landowner for CVCA.  Mr. Mullion is the lease farmer for MCWA for the proposed CVCA Phase I lands and is responsible for setting the irrigation schedules for approximately 700 acres of agricultural fields in the Cibola Valley;  "	As a lease farmer, Mr. Mullion controls, maintains, and provides the irrigation for his lease lands and currently employees a full-time staff to provide irrigation to Cibola Valley lands. Integration and coordination of the irrigation requirements for both the active agricultural fields and restoration projects is critical; and "	MCWA is a willing partner, sharing the same goals and objectives as Reclamation in the continuing effort to create and restore native habitat. MCWA has made these agricultural fields available for Reclamation's use under its obligation to restore habitat consistent with the Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation Program. Mr. Mullion is the only lease farmer currently authorized by MCWA to irrigate these fields. This procurement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is on or about February 13, 2006.  Please direct any questions to Carmen Bernhardt at (702) 293-8601, or email cbernhardt@lc.usbr.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 115116 and the size standard is $6,000,000.00.

<SUBJECT>A -- NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function
<SOLNBR>260-06-01
<RESPDATE>021706
<CONTACT>Danielle Sweeney, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 496-4487, Fax (301) 402-0178, Email sweeneyd@od.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a requirement for the Development of the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function.  The NIH is seeking small business concerns, including 8(a) small business and/or small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business and Service-Disabled Veteran small business concerns with the capabilities to assist in the development of the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function.  This toolbox is to provide investigators with a brief, but comprehensive, measurement tool for assessment of cognitive, emotional, sensory and motor function of participants in large cohort studies such as epidemiological studies, clinical studies, or clinical trials.  Specific goals of the contract are: 1) To develop a core set of tasks that will address the domains of cognitive, emotional, sensory, and motor function.  2) To integrate the specific following characteristics in the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function: Multidimensional - Should include multiple constructs within each of the domains of cognitive, motor, sensory and emotional function. Versatile - The assessment method should be capable of monitoring neurological and  behavioral health status and function over time (as in longitudinal epidemiological studies) as  well as evaluating effectiveness of interventions and treatments (as in clinical trials).  Ceiling and floor effects should be considered.  The measures should be modular and readily portable from one type of study design to another.  Where psychometrically feasible, the method should incorporate ways to ‘crosswalk’ to existing and previous studies through the use of embedded benchmark items. This would eventually allow the mapping of a smaller set of test items back to a unifying latent construct where a common metric can be used across measures.  Brief - All efforts should be taken to ensure low respondent burden.  Methodologically sound - The measures should demonstrate validity and reliability.  State-of-the-art - Development of the assessment method and measures should employ  modern psychometric approaches to the measurement of latent dimensions, e.g., item 
response theory models and computer-adaptive testing, to the extent relevant. Diverse - The assessments should have known measurement properties across cultures and age ranges.  English and Spanish versions should be developed and validated in culturally and geographically diverse groups.  Dynamic - It will be strongly encouraged that the assessment method be dynamic, i.e., capable of being adapted over time in response to advances in science and/or advances in technology.  Measures should be employed that are internally flexible, e.g., adaptive testing.  The instrument should demonstrate sensitivity to change over 
time.  The tasks will be structured in two phases.  Phase I will encompass qualitative research focusing on the identification of content area and the development of domain specific tasks.   
Phase II addresses the formal testing and refining of the final toolbox of tests.  The NIH is requesting capability statements from small business concerns capable of fulfilling this 
requirement.  The Technical Evaluation Criteria for this project is posted herein.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future.  No RFP is available at this time.  Small business concerns that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake the work described above should submit an original and two (02) copies of their capability statement, not to exceed 15 pages, to the address shown in this notice by February 17, 2006.  Interested sources should tailor their capability statements to be responsive to the tasks described above and the evaluation criteria posted herein.  Capability statements exceeding the page limitation will not be considered. Electronic copies of capability statements will also be accepted and can be submitted via email to sweeneyd@od.nih.gov or faxed to Danielle C. Sweeney @ (301) 402-0178.  Electronic capability statements are also subject to the 15 page limitation.  The North American 
Classification System (NAICS) code is 541720.  SEE NUMBERED NOTE 26.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  SOURCES SOUGHT: This Is NOT A Notice of Request for Proposal (RFP)  This is a Sources Sought Synopsis; there is no solicitation available at  this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response. This  Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only, to  identify potential sources. Objective:  The US Air Force (USAF) is conducting a survey of fabrics for  a potential Update to the current Physical Fitness Uniform. All sources capable of providing Fabrics are being sought.  All sources  responding must indicate their size status in relation to the applicable  Standard Industrial Classification (SIC Code), Business, including  affiliates employing an average of 1000 individuals or less during the  last 12 months are considered small.  Sources with 8(a) status or  otherwise classified as small disadvantage business should state  accordingly in their response. The US Air Force (USAF) is conducting a survey of fabrics for a potential  Update to the current Physical Fitness Uniform. PANT: REFERNCE CRFD/PD 04-10 June 23, 2004 JACKET: REFERNCE CRFD/PD 04-08 June 23, 2004 TRUNKS: REFERNCE CRFD/PD 04-07 June 23, 2004 Suit will be used primarily for, but not limited to, physical training  activity (PT).  All Garments submitted should incorporate commercially  available innovative garment design and fabric performance to provide  comfort, functionality and durability.  Advanced performance technologies  such as garment/fabric “systems” a plus, and incorporation of Fiber/finish  Nanotechnology is also highly desirable. Important features to be considered are: Physical properties such as exemplary tensile and tear strength, the  ability to wick & transmit vapor, repel water, resist staining, abrasion &  air permeation.  Strong color performance properties to minimize Crocking,  CF to light, color change after laundering and Perspiration staining are  desired.  Priorities include reduction in overall weight, noise, and  durability to repeated home launderings.  The use of anti-microbial agents  is also beneficial.   Lining should address factors such as moisture  management/breath ability, abrasion resistance, stretch ability, and  optimal comfort as it will be worn closest to the skin.  Current suit is  used across varied climates.  In addition trunks may be used for swimming  in some cases, so resistance to salt & chlorine are also factors for  consideration. Finished garments should be the same or similar in appearance/design to  current specs (referenced above).   Any available industry advancements in  reflective technology are desired to optimize visibility/safety, and  should be incorporated. Interested parties must submit finished garment prototypes along with  complete technical data information including but not limited to the tests  listed below.

<DESC>This survey is designed to provide U.S. House of Representatives Members’ personal offices with information regarding the activities and practices of other Members’ personal office staff compensation, employment practices, and employee benefit trend data.  With turnover averaging approximately 30% in veteran Member offices, compensation, employment, and employee benefit trend data of other veteran member offices is critical information in helping them to develop strategies to retain valued staff.  As new Members are elected, Members’ personal Office Staff compensation, employment practices, and employee benefit trend data is important as they begin to establish their office practices and procedures, hire staff and remain a competitive hiring agent.

In order for negotiations between employer and applicants to work efficiently and to allow U. S. House of Representatives Members’ personal Office Staff (Washington, DC and District offices) employing offices to hire the most qualified candidates for open positions, both the employing office and the applicants must be knowledgeable regarding the activities and practices of the Members’ personal Office Staff labor market.  If sufficient current data is readily available to employing offices the negotiation process could lead to inefficient employment agreements – the overcompensation of some staff and the under-compensation of others.  An additional effect to inefficient employment relationships is employer/employee dissatisfaction, lowered staff morale, increased staff turnover, reduced constituent servicing and general dissatisfaction among staff member

The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding  a requirement for a TF34 propulsion system performance upgrade for the  A-10 weapon system. The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems  Center, Agile Combat Support Wing, Propulsion Systems Squadron,  Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH. As formally documented in the TF34  Propulsion Upgrade Program Capabilities Development Document dated 15  March 2005, the A-10 has long been recognized as underpowered. During  FY04, the current Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff for  the Air Force (SECAF/CSAF) requested the USAF address this need. The most  effective solution is a kit upgrade to the current engine. The upgraded  engine must 1) still fit in current nacelle, 2) not require major A-10  structural modification, and 3) produce sufficient additional thrust to  address identified deficiencies. To meet cost and schedule constraints,  the A-10 engine upgrade must be based on mature technology. The kit  approach offers best value, meets A-10 and warfighter needs, and provides  the fastest delivery of the propulsion upgrade at significantly lower  risk. This modification approach saves three to four (3-4) years over  development. There is a proposed FY07 target year to begin a three (3)  year Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD) effort ($189.4M budget).  The modification kit purchases must begin with adequate lead time to  support kit installations by late FY09 or early FY10. Acquisition planning  factors include the following assumptions: 1) The acquisition effort  begins at Milestone B, 2) 356 A-10s will be modified, 3) in addition, 95  spare engines will be modified. Key A-10 propulsion upgrade attributes  include: increased high/hot take off payload, reduced threat  exposure/improved survivability, improved austere field capability,  maintaining existing TF34 reliability, maintainability, supportability,  and survivability and reducing transit time. Specific Key Performance  Parameters (KPP) are as follows; KPP #1: Operate from high density  altitude airfields with militarily significant payloads. Part 1: Threshold  Requirement, a 47K Ib A/OA-10 (Drag Index (DI) of 7.75) operating on a  9,000 foot runway at 5,000 feet PA and 35 degrees C can lose an engine at  rotation, jettison stores (41.6K Ibs remaining, DI of 3.62) and climb with  the gear up and failed engine windmilling and maintain a minimum rate of  climb of 150 feet per minute (FPM). Objective Requirement, under the same  conditions maintains a minimum climb rate of 500 FPM. Part 2:  Threshold  Requirement, a 47 K Ib A/OA-10 (DI of 7.75) operating on a runway at 5,000  feet PA and 35 degrees C must have a critical field length of less than  9,000 feet. Objective Requirement, under the same conditions has a  critical field length of less than 7,500 feet.  KPP #2: Operate from  austere expeditionary airfields.  Part 1: Threshold Requirement, a 47K Ib  A/OA-10 (DI of 7.75) operating on a 5,000 foot runway at 2,500 foot PA and  25 degrees C can lose an engine at rotation, jettison stores (41.6 Ibs  remaining, DI of 3.62) and climb with the gear up and failed engine  windmilling and maintain a minimum rate of climb of 150 FPM. Objective  Requirement, under the same conditions maintains a minimum climb rate of  500 FPM.  Part 2:  Threshold Requirement, a 42K Ib A/OA-10 (DI of 3.93)  operating on an airfield at a 2,500 foot PA and 25 degrees C must have a  critical field length of less than 5,000 feet. Objective Requirement, A  47K lb A/OA-10 (DI of 3.93) must have a critical field length of less than  4,500 ft under the same conditions. KPP #3:  Maximize gross weight on  take-off (weapons and internal fuel).  Threshold Requirement, operate a 51  K Ib A/OA-10 (DI of 14.49) on a 9,000 foot runway, sea level, at a  temperature of 30 degrees C, be able to lose an engine at rotation,  jettison stores (41.6K Ibs remaining, DI of 3.62) and climb with the gear  up and failed engine wind milling and maintain a minimum rate of climb of  150 FPM. Objective Requirement, under the same conditions but operates on  a 7,500 foot runway.   KPP #4: Survivability-Minimize threat exposure by  increasing operating and employment envelope.  Threshold Requirement, a  48K lb maximum payload configured A/OA-10 can operate at or above 20,000’  MSL (STD day) in wings level un-accelerated flight at a minimum of 225  KIAS and have excess power to initiate a 500 FPM rate of climb capability.  Objective Requirement, under the same conditions operates at or above  25,000’ MSL (STD day).  In addition to the KPPs one Key System Attribute  (KSA) presents a significant requirement for the upgraded TF34, KSA #4:  Maximize mission duration and on-station time.  Threshold Requirement,  with the upgraded engine achieve the same mission duration as the current  A-10 on the same respective mission profile.  Objective Requirement, with  the same fuel load and similar configuration; achieve a 10% increase in  mission duration on the same profile. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified small business sources and their size classifications (HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Veteran-Owned, and Small Disadvantaged Business) relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only. Businesses that are not considered small under the NAICS code should not submit responses to this sources sought announcement. Project Description: The goal of the project will be to implement a National Action Plan for Behavioral Health Workforce Development. In 2002, the American College of Mental Health Administration held its annual summit on issues related to human resources in behavioral healthcare. This summit led to two purchase orders from SAMHSA’s Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) to a group that subsequently became known as the Annapolis Coalition. The Annapolis Coalition in turn is one of the workgroups of an entity known as the Academic Behavioral Health Consortium. The first purchase order resulted in a meeting held in Annapolis, Maryland, and a subsequent publication (Administration and Policy in Mental Health. Hoge, M. A., and Morris, A., eds. Special Double Issue: Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training, 29: 4/5, May 2002) that summarized the activities of the group, including human resource problems. The second purchase order was designed to begin identifying solutions to these problems. Again, a large meeting was held in Annapolis, Maryland, which resulted in a solutions approach called "competency based training." Another special issue of the Administration and Policy in Mental Health Journal was published summarizing the results of this meeting (Administration and Policy in Mental Health. Hoge, M. A., and Morris, A., eds. Special Issue: Implementing Best Practices in Behavioral Health Workforce Education, 32: 2, November 2004.).  Based upon the results achieved in these two purchase orders, subcontracts were awarded to the Annapolis Coalition in 2004 and 2005 to develop, through a consensus building process, a draft National Behavioral Health Workforce Development plan; convene a National Summit on Human Resource Transformation to build broad-based support for future implementation of the plan; and provide an outline for developing a National Human Resource Transformation Center that could provide support to the entire behavioral health field with respect to initial clinical training and continuing education. In addition, the subcontract supported the updating of the web site for the Annapolis Coalition (currently www.annapoliscoaliton.org) so that the web site would be interactive and capable of delivering modern information technology-based training at a distance, in which trainees work at their own speed from a training protocol and which will permit interactive video streaming of important training tools. 
The focus of the project will be to: (1) Identify additional Federal, National, State, Public and Private stakeholders who need to be involved in the development and implementation of the plan and develop and implement a strategy for obtaining their input in, and support of, the plan; (2) In collaboration with SAMHSA, convene meetings with stakeholder groups to obtain their detailed reviews of the draft plan; (3) Refine the plan based on input from all Federal, National, State, Public and Private stakeholders. The plan will have greater impact if it is considered an evolving blueprint that is periodically refined through expanded stakeholder participation; (4) Provide technical assistance to various stakeholder groups identified by SAMHSA as priority groups in implementing the plan; (5) Provide technical assistance to states, communities and organizations, and individuals who seek guidance on workforce planning and interventions based on the plan, via web-based tools, phone consultation, and on-site assistance; (6) Disseminate the plan through issue briefs, web sites and other marketing and communication strategies; (7) Develop a tracking system for monitoring the implementation of the plan by the various entities; (8) Provide consultation to the SAMHSA workforce development workgroup and the various Centers within SAMHSA as they develop an agency agenda on workforce development based on the plan; (9) Consult with SAMHSA around the selection of high priority action items; develop proposed implementation options/plans for SAMHSA review; coordinate and/or support the implementation of selected options; and implement selected options; (10) Provide logistical support, including travel, lodging, and meeting support, as needed. Your responses to the questions provided below will assist the Government in selecting the appropriate acquisition method. Page limit: Maximum 11 pages (font size 10 or larger). In addition, a copy of the company capability statement will be accepted (not subject to the 11-page limit above). The anticipated period of performance is 12 months, with two 12-month option periods. After review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and formal solicitation may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities. Response to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to the NAICS code, and must respond to the following questions:
1.	Is your business a small business under the NAICS code? 
2.	Does your firm qualify as a small disadvantaged business? 
3.	If disadvantaged, specify if your firm is certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? 
4.	Are you considered a certified HUBZone firm? 
5.	Are you considered woman-owned or operated business? 
6.	Are you a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned or Veteran-Owned business?

Part C. Comments on the SMIS SIS SOW ¡V   The FBI is asking industry to comment on the Draft SMIS SIS SOW.  The FBI created the following questions to stimulate industry thinking on the Draft SMIS SIS SOW.  The list of questions is not exclusive and the FBI does not expect answers for every question.  The intent is to produce a quality SOW for the eventual RFP.   

Are there any areas where the tasks of the System Integration Contractor (SIC) are ambiguous or unclear?  If so, how would you recommend clarifying?
Is it clear that delivery of capability (i.e., automated support to the end user) is paramount and that the Government expects the SIC to propose and execute an implementation methodology that emphasizes ¡§speed to market¡¨ where the ¡§market¡¨ in this case is the Security Division consumer?
Is it clear that the SIC has the flexibility (in fact is expected to) to propose alternative solutions to the fundamental requirement?
Is the Government¡¦s Business Process Improvement strategy clear, and does the draft SOW provide sufficient information clearly defining the GFI to be provided in this area?  If not, what areas concern you and explain the type and depth of information you require.
a.	Are the deliverables that the BPE team will be providing to the SIC necessary and sufficient?  What should be changed/added/augmented/ removed?
b.	Is it clear what the interfaces are between the BPE team, and the SIC?
c.	From the information provided, can one determine how an SIC would utilize the BPE deliverables, and what the value of those deliverables would be to the SIC's effort?
d.	Is it clear what is required of the SIC with respect to the Organizational Change Management (OCM) activities that necessarily will occur in support of releases of enhanced SMIS capabilities?
e.	Is it clear how the BPE team deliverables document and support OCM initiatives with Security Division?
Is the intent to provide high availability/COOP capability with SMIS sufficiently defined to enable an Offeror to respond?  If not, what additional information as a minimum would an Offeror require?
Key Personnel:  The Government considers qualified, key personnel who will be with the project during its initial 365 days as the primary risk mitigation strategy to ensure timely delivery of the expected base period capability.  What number by position description and skill sets would you recommend identifying as key personnel for the SMIS effort?  What education level, professional certifications, etc. would you recommend for these positions?
What contract type(s) would you recommend the Government use in pursuing the work identified herein?  What type of parameters would you consider necessary in a SOW anticipating a performance-based contract?  Would you consider any parts of the required effort appropriate for Firm Fixed Price?  If so, which?
Deliverables.  Are the task work products which will form the basis of the actual contract deliverables sufficient?  Do you recommend different deliverables (more, less, why?)  What would you recommend be changed to provide the Government the necessary information for oversight and assessment?
Is the intent of the SMIS Development Network clear?  Is sufficient information provided to enable an Offeror to assess the requirements and cost associated with the concept?  Would you recommend any alternative strategies or approaches to partnering with the Government?  If so, please elaborate.
What level of Work Breakdown Structure would be required to unambiguously present your proposed strategy?


Part D. Estimate- Provide a list of recommended labor categories and rates for the SMIS SIS services.


Responses shall be identified with RFI No. FBI-06-SMIS-01. Responses shall be no more than twenty (20) pages in length and in Microsoft Word file format.

<DESC>Outreach for Operation and Maintenance of the
Chevelon Houses and RV sites
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests
Black Mesa Ranger District
Navajo County, AZ


Purpose

The purpose of this Outreach Notice is to determine the potential application pool for operating and maintaining a Ranger Station that is no longer needed by the Forest Service.  The site is known as the Chevelon Houses and RV sites. The sites are located on the Black Mesa Ranger District, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests.  The authorized officer for this offering is Elaine Zieroth, Forest Supervisor, P.O. Box 640, Springerville, Arizona 85938.   The Forest Vicinity Map displays the general location of the facilities.

Submitting a Response

Interested parties should compile a short (one page or less) response that indicates their name and address, type of affiliation (individual, corporation, state government, etc.), description of proposed use, the expected users and public benefits.  Responses will help determine the type of prospectus to be advertised. The outreach will provide the Forest Service a list of interested parties to solicit applications from for issuance of a special-use permit for operation and maintenance of the site. The permit holder will be responsible for applicable use fees, marketing, reservation management, fee collection and property management of the Chevelon Housing and RV sites.  

Written responses must be submitted to the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests, Attention:  Kate Klein, P.O. Box 968, Overgaard, AZ 85933.  The response must be received no later than March 1, 2006.

Overview of Opportunity

The site is a Forest Service administrative site that was previously operated as a Ranger Station. The Forest Service no longer utilizes the facilities.  The permit holder may be authorized to use all government owned facilities and infrastructure under the terms of the special use permit.  The permit holder will be responsible for operation and maintenance of all the facilities including the water and sewage system.  The permit fee may be offset in whole or in part by the value of Government maintenance and reconditioning, according to Granger-Thye fee offset regulations.

Facilities being offered in this prospectus are 3 houses, 2 duplexes, 12 RV sites, 11 apartments, one 1700 sq. foot office and approximately 8,000 sq. ft. of workshops/garages/storage buildings.  

The Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests, administered as one National Forest from the Supervisor’s Office in Springerville, encompass two million acres of magnificent mountain country in east-central Arizona.  The high, cool elevation of the Mogollon Rim and the string of man-made lakes in the ponderosa pine forest are within a 45 minute drive of the sites covered by this prospectus.  The Mogollon Rim is a dramatic 1000-foot escarpment that is the southern boundary of the Colorado Plateau.

The facilities are located approximately 45 miles south of Winslow via a paved road and about 35 miles north of Woods Canyon Lake via graveled roads.  The sites are located at an elevation of approximately 7,000 feet in ponderosa-pine vegetation type.

The major recreation activities in the summer and fall are driving for pleasure, camping, picnicking, fishing, mountain biking, boating, horseback riding, hiking, photography, hunting, viewing wildlife and fall colors.  Winter offers sledding, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling and ice fishing.  The Forest provides good habitat for a wide variety of wildlife species, such as elk, deer, antelope, black bear, turkeys, songbirds and small mammals.  Fishing is a major attraction on the lakes near the area.

Temperatures during the summer are relatively mild, averaging from 50° to 75° during the day.  Nighttime temperatures average about 45°.  July and August are typically rainy months, with daily afternoon thunderstorms.  Late August and September temperatures average about 60°, with lows at night around 25° to 30°.  The area receives approximately 20 inches of precipitation in the form of snow and rain.

<CONTACT>Sherri Comer, 410-278-0867
<DESC>The Government is seeking sources for the re-procurement of the Sight, Night Vision, Sniperscope (SNS) AN/PVS-10.  The sight must meet all the requirements of MIL-SPEC-45428, dated 1 March 2001, Performance Specification for Sight, Night Vision, Snip erscope (SNS), AN-PVS-10 which establishes the performance, manufacture, test, and acceptance requirements for the SNS.  The specification and the drawings cited in the specification are available by request.  The Sight, Night Vision, Sniper Scope, hereina fter referred to as the Sniper Night Sight (SNS), is a lightweight, weapon mounted, self contained day/night weapon system.  Sniper weapons supported include the M24 Sniper Weapons System (SWS), and the M110 Semi-Auto Sniper System (SASS).  The M24 and the  M110 utilize 7.62 mm NATO ammunition.  It is an image intensified passive device designed primarily for use by the sniper for both day and night operations.  A day/night select lever permits the user to change the mode of operation from day to night or fr om night back to day.  The SNS employs a variable gain image tube that can be adjusted by the user depending on ambient light levels.  It includes a reticle that can be used either as a blackline reticle for daytime use or can be illuminated for night oper ation when required.  An eyepiece diopter adjustment is provided so the SNS can be used without corrective glasses.  A MIL-STD-1913 mounting interface is integrated into the base of the sight to permit the sight to be quickly mounted or dismounted to the w eapon.   The SNS optical system is comprised of two optical channels.  The night channel includes an objective and eyepiece, common to both the day and night channels, an 18mm image intensifier tube, and an optical relay between the image tube and reticle.  The day  channel includes the common objective and eyepiece, and an optical relay.  The eyepiece can be focused to accommodate different users.  An aiming reticle is provided at the common image plane of the objective and eyepiece.  The reticle can be used either as a blackline reticle or can be illuminated for use at night.  The reticle aim point can be adjusted for zeroing to the weapon and to correct for both elevation and windage.  Tactile adjustment increments are: 1.0 minute-of-arc (MOA) for elevation and 0.5  MOA for windage.  A ballistically compensated scale is provided for the elevation adjustment with markings from 100 to 1,000 meters in 50 meter increments.  Two (2) Alkaline or Lithium 1.5 Volt dc AA commercial battery cells power the SNS image intensifie r (I2) tube and the reticle light emitting diode (LED).   The SNS system consists of the day/night viewer, integrated mount adapter, carrying case, and shipping and storage case.  Ancillary equipment includes the following:  eyeguard, objective lens cover, sunshade, eyepiece lens cap, and operator's manual.  The shipping and storage case protects the SNS system against damage associated with transportation, handling and storage.  The soft carrying case provides protection against the conditions associated with carrying the SNS and its ancillary equipment in a fiel d environment.  The integrated mounting adapter interfaces directly to the MIL-STD-1913 rail.  The viewer consists of a body, objective lens, eyepiece lens, relay lens, and I2 tube.  The viewer body contains a low-battery LED indicator, electronic control switches, and a day/night select lever.  The electronic controls for the image tube includes a button which turns the sight ON or OFF and two buttons for scene brightness control.  The electronic controls for the reticle includes a button for turning the r eticle ON or OFF and two buttons for brightness control.  When the day/night select lever is in the day position, a disconnect circuit turns system power OFF.  When in the day position, neither the image tube nor reticle can be turned ON. Interested sources should request the specification cited above and the drawings referenced in the sp ecification from the POC below NLT 21 February 2006.   Potential sources will be required to submit technical information in hard copy addressing system performance, environmental characteristics, and electromagnetic interference as compared to the require ments listed in the specification.  Two (2) production representative samples are required to be submitted with the technical information if the source has not delivered the sight to the US Army within 12 months of the posting date of this notice.  Sources  who have delivered representative systems to the US Army in the last 12 months shall submit the following information:  Contract number, contract date, Contracting Officer, and contact information to include telephone number and email address.  Technical information and samples shall be submitted within 14 days of receipt of the specification and drawings to:  Mr. Keith Boykin, telephone (703) 704-1310, fax (703) 704-3449, email royce.keith.boykin@us.army.mil, mailing/shipping address:  Product Manager Sen sors and Lasers, ATTN: SFAE-SEQ-SSL (Keith Boykin) 10170 Beach Road, Bldg. 325, Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5820.  Production samples will be tested in a laboratory environment and during live fire.  Sample systems will be returned to the offeror NLT than 60 days  after receipt.   This request is limited to contractors that are capable of providing completely integrated systems that meet the requirements herein defined.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Information obt ained through this sources sought announcement will be utilized for planning purposes and possible Government procurement.  Documentation provided will not be returned.  This is a sources sought notice only.  It is for planning purposes only and should not  be construed as a Request for Proposal or a commitment by the United States Government to procure any systems.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DoD) SMALL BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER (STTR) PROGRAM 2006.  Small high-technology firms and research institutions are encouraged to jointly submit proposals to DoD for high quality cooperative research and development to solve the defense-related scientific or engineering problems set forth in the solicitation, especially those concepts that also have high potential for commercialization in the private sector.  STTR solicitation 2006 was publicly released on the DoD SBIR/STTR Web Site (http://www.acq.osd.mil/sadbu/sbir) on Feb 1, 2006.   The 2006 STTR Solicitation will open for receipt of proposals on Mar 14, 2006 and will close at 6:00 AM EST, April 14, 2006.  NOTE:  Proposals received after the specified due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).  Submissions must include the proposal cover sheets, technical proposal, Company Commercialization Report, and cost proposal to be considered a complete proposal.  Six DoD components will participate in the 2006 solicitation – the Department of the Army; the Department of the Air Force; the Department of the Navy; the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  The solicitation lists all the R&D topics under which DoD is seeking proposals, and also contains detailed information on the parameters of the STTR program and how to submit a proposal.  Small firms and research institutions apply first for a phase I award of not to exceed $100,000 and one year, to test the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of a particular concept.  If phase I proves successful, the firm may be invited to apply for a phase II award not to exceed $750,000 for up to 24 months, to further develop the concept.  Proposals must be submitted via the DOD SBIR/STTR website at “http://www.dodsbir.net/submission” following the instructions contained in the solicitation, including the instructions specified in the solicitation for the DoD component to which you are applying.  Offerors bear the risk of website inaccessibility due to heavy usage in the final hours before the solicitation closing time, so plan ahead and submit early.  The complete solicitation may be accessed at http://www.dodsbir.net/solicitation.  Participation in the DoD STTR Program is restricted to small business firms organized for profit with 500 or fewer employees, including all affiliated firms."

<SUBJECT>A -- WORKSHOP ON INTRA-CHIP COMMUNICATION
<DESC>The Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is organizing a workshop to discuss the technical challenges and opportunities for photonic intra-chip communication for ultradense two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) chips.  Increasing device density and higher operating speeds impose ever-increasing demands on communications between devices and functional units on an ultradense chip.  Photonic technologies offer potential advantages for communications and this workshop will focus on a discussion of innovative ideas that could enable photonics to meet the challenging demands of intra-chip communications.   We are explicitly interested in an open discussion on pros and cons of photonic and electronic intra-chip communications and the most promising technologies and approaches.
While we envision the development of photonic intra-chip communications as being potentially beneficial for any ultradense chip, we focus on photonic intra-chip communications for high-performance microprocessors in order to make the discussion more concrete.  We pose a set of questions to the community in attempting to address this topic:
•       Are there clear and significant (quantifiable) benefits
associated with using photonics for intra-chip communications?  What are the opportunities?  Challenges?
•	What are the right metrics for measuring performance improvement in intra-chip communications? 
•	How would these communication benefits quantitatively translate into processor performance improvements, if implemented today or at a future technology node?  
•	What are the relevant performance requirements on photonic devices (modulators, detectors, etc.) to enable such high-performance photonic intra-chip communications?  
•	How can the stringent size, power, tunability, and other performance requirements for photonic devices be met?  
•	How can such photonic devices and infrastructure essential for intra-chip communication be integrated into traditional electronic chips in a manner compatible with modern CMOS processing?
•	Are there novel photonic communication architectures that would be significantly superior to current electronic communication architectures?
•	What are the most promising methods of fabrication of these chips?
•	How can chip design technologies take advantage of photonic communications?
Please note that this workshop is not a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts.  The workshop is planned for March 27-28, 2006 near Arlington, VA, and will be by invitation only.  If you have innovative ideas that address these or other issues germane to photonic on-chip communications and would like to attend the workshop, please send a one-page write-up to Matthew Rogers (Matthew.Rogers.ctr@darpa.mil) by February 20, 2006.  Your write-up should include a brief description of the materials you would like to present as well as an overall description of your position regarding this technology area.  We will inform you of our decision by February 24, 2006.  A website with further information on the workshop and for registration will be provided at that time.  The government will not assume liability for costs incurred for travel expenses, presentations, marketing material, etc.  If there are questions related to the technical content of the workshop, please contact Jag Shah (Jag.Shah@darpa.mil 703-696-2253).  Jag Shah and Dan Radack are the MTO Program Managers sponsoring this workshop.

<SUBJECT>A -- Six-month Extension in the Period of Performance of Contract HQ0006-02-C-0044
<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency has a requirement for a six-month extension of the Airborne Infrared Surveillance (AIRS) effort.  The extension is to bridge the gap between 31 March 2006, the date the period of performance of Contract HQ0006-02-C-0044 ends, and the beginning date of the period of performance of the planned new AIRS contract vehicle.  This effort continues the use of an electro-optic/infrared sensor designed, developed and integrated into the host aircraft by the incumbent contractor, L-3 Communications/Aeromet Division.  The sensor is hosted on a Gulfstream II aircraft operated by L-3 Communications /Aeromet and is used as a test asset for data collection by the MDA.  The aircraft/sensor combination is called the High Altitude Observatory (HALO) II.  The key technical capabilities requiring further demonstration and evaluation are:  1) cued and autonomous search, detection, and acquisition; 2) real-time missile tracking and 3-D state vector generation; 3) real-time discrimination of object(s) of interest; and 4) real-time connectivity with  MDAs Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications system.

The effort will continue to include data collection, analyses and potential modification of the sensor suite mounted on the HALO II aircraft.  The HALO II sensor suite will be used to collect infrared surveillance data against targets of interest to the MDA.  This data will be processed in real time on board the HALO II to form state vectors and object sighting messages to be downlinked to the MDA C2BMC system as fire control solutions.  The required effort consists of detailed test planning, engineering evaluations, minor modifications, and experiments and demonstrations for the HALO II aircraft and its support equipment.  

MDA intends to award a contract extension to L-3 Communications/Aeromet for this six-month effort.  MDA intends that this contract extension will be cost-plus-fixed-fee, the same contract type as the contract ending 31 March 2006. This contract extension will be awarded to L-3 Communications/Aeromet pursuant to FAR 37.111, Extension of Services and under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1-(a) (iii): only one responsible source.  It is improbable that a new competition for a six-month extension could be executed without causing a gap in the AIRS effort.   A contract extension to the incumbent Contractor is the only solution to avoid unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirement.

The Economic Research Service (ERS), as the lead economic research arm of the Department, has responsibility to conduct economic research supporting the mission of the Department.  This responsibility includes conducting research and providing information to Department officials on economic issues related to food safety, nutrition and health (including factors related to food choices), consumption patterns at and away from home, food prices, food assistance programs, nutrition education, and food industry structure.  While some of this research can be accomplished using publicly available data, some issues may require collection of new data.      Departmental policy officials often manage and address the effects of unforeseen food and agricultural market developments such as large swings in sales volume, prices, or quantities purchased of major food products without the most up-to-date market information.  During high-profile events, such as BSE or sales declines of orange juice consumption, access to up-to-date data and information on consumers’ intentions and market transactions is particularly critical. Publicly available data on price and quantity of purchased and consumed foods are not available for households in consistent fashion, and the available data are not current.  The USDA’s disappearance data system provides annual consumption estimates for several hundred commodities.  Consumption is based on production data and dates back to 1909.  The data are used to analyze trends and shifts in food consumption, to calculate the nutrient content of the food supply, and to compare the composition of the food supply with dietary recommendations.  The data provide national averages only and the lag between data collection and release has averaged about two years. The U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics has conducted an annual Consumer Expenditures Survey since 1980.  This series provides information on the spending patterns of American households from a nationally representative sample of 5,000 households.  The survey provides a breakdown on spending for food at home but no information on quantities or prices.  The lag between data collection and release averages about a year. The yearly National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a joint USDA and Health and Human Services activity, collect dietary intake data on a nationally representative sample of 5,000 individuals.  The survey provides information on food intake by individuals, where food was purchased and eaten and, for sampled persons only, personal, economic, and demographic characteristics.  The data are used to examine who eats what in America, to compare intake with dietary guidelines, to analyze effects of individual characteristics on food consumption, and to link food intake with health outcomes.  The data does not include food prices and there is a 2-year lag between data collection and release. A primary objective of the research program is to understand food purchase and consumption patterns of consumers and how these change as people age, households change, new products are introduced, and new information is acquired; identify and develop consistent strategies for consumers in various demographic groups and regions to effectively adopt the Dietary Guidelines for Americans; better understand the market dynamics of food safety and other consumer health issues; and understand links between foods, physical activity and health outcomes; quickly survey consumers about new issues or developments. Another key objective of the program is to provide real-time information on consumer reactions to unforeseen events and disruptions, current market events, and government policies.  When markets are shocked, effective management of market impacts require a solid understanding of how consumer reactions would be linked to actual food purchases, sales, consumption, and price information. Finally, the program seeks to understand how individual attitudes and knowledge and healthful eating affect food choices, dietary status, and health outcomes. Consumer and Market Trends: Data needs consist of historical and most recent updates on prices, quantities sold, and total sales volume for various food products (see attached list) on a national, regional, and market (where available) basis across the U.S. for foods consumed either at or away from home. These data would be used to: Examine trends in the retail food market; Identify differences in food prices across markets in the U.S.; Measure the impact of food purchasing behavior on food prices, accessibility, services, and assortment; Compare measures of food purchase behavior to measures of food purchase behavior in the Consumer Expenditure Survey; Determine the types of foods that U.S. households purchase by demographic segment with specific focus on low-income households and how they differ from other demographic groups; Identify the prices that households pay for foods purchased and how household demographics, including income, affect prices paid and quantities purchased; Assess how low-income households differ in the food choices they make and the prices that they pay for food. In addition, historical and current purchase data are need at item level for food consumed either at or away from home that are based on a demographically and geographically representative sample of U.S. households.  These data will be used to implement research in such issues as: Investigating the impact of USDA's National Organic Program on product differentiation and household demand for differentiated milk products (organic, non-rBGH, and conventional); Identifying what price households pay for foods purchased and how household demographics, including income, affect prices paid and quantities purchased; Identifying differences in food prices across markets in the U.S. and analyze the impact the increasing number of alternative retail outlets for food on food prices and accessibility; Investigating the effect of different tastes and preferences across households on food demand; and Measure the impact of consumer food purchasing behavior on food prices, accessibility, services, and assortment. These issues require transaction-level information that would cover food purchases by each household for all restaurants and all food store outlets available to a household and identify the store and restaurants from which each item or meal is purchased.  In addition, all available descriptions such as ‘organic’, ‘non-RBST’, ‘genetically-engineered’, ‘GE’, ‘non-GE’, and/or ‘non-RBGH’ should be clearly identified.  Research would depend on (1) full knowledge of sampling and expenditure weights in order to aggregate measures both nationally and per local market for individual food products and aggregated food groups, and (2) a complete description of sample design. In addition to sample weights and design, other relevant data (such as strata and clusters) drive the research.  A data description dictionary that provides a full explanation of any abbreviated terms in the data and a listing of all the available common characteristics are particularly important.  All information on household demographics and l outlet details are significant components of successful research implementation.  For food-away-from-home issues, recipes (when available) are critical. Food Consumption Special Reports:  Historical and current data and analytical intelligence on consumption (rather than purchase) of foods at and away from home are needed to examine how consumer attitudes and market trend and fads affect consumers diet and health.  For this purpose, consumption data for members of a demographically and regionally representative sample of US household along with rich demographic, including dietary and attitudinal, information is needed.  Special Requests for Consumer and Market Information: Responding to requests for specific product, brand, or outlet information or anticipating key issues relating to specific foods, customized analyses will be require to examine in detail at a specific product or sub-group of food items for foods consumed either at or away from home.  For example, a report may contain detailed information on the retail trends in orange juice sales or report changes in the type and frequency of beef sales by region by various household (or individual), or restaurant characteristics. In addition, ERS would seek ad-hoc, drill-down analyses on the impacts of specific policy concerns or unexpected events on specific foods or meals, market conditions, demographic groups, or any combination of the above-mentioned items.  For example, the influence of low-carb diets on sales of bakery products, restaurant foods, and new product and meal introductions at retail stores and restaurants.  Non-proprietary or syndicated analyses or publications on issues of interest could also be considered. Special requests can quickly provide analytical information on high-profile issues, particularly as they relate to consumers’ attitude and health and knowledge information.  Special requests often call for collecting primary data from panel members on their perceptions, intentions, and attitudes with respect to unforeseen disruption or high-profile market events.  Such information is needed to examine how consumer intentions would impact the market, or match consumers’ actual purchases in the market place.  Non-proprietary or syndicated analyses or publications on these issues would also be of interest. List of aggregate Categories: cereals products, flour and prepared flour mixes, breakfast cereal, rice, pasta, cornmeal; bakery products, bread, fresh biscuits, rolls, muffins, cakes, cupcakes, and cookies, other bakery products;      beef and veal, uncooked ground beef, uncooked other beef, pork, processed fresh, other pork, other meats; poultry, chicken, other poultry including turkey; fish and seafood, fresh fish and seafood, processed fish and seafood; eggs; fairy and related products, milk, cheese and related products, ice cream and related products, other dairy and related products; fruits and vegetables, fresh fruits and vegetables, fresh fruits, apples, bananas, citrus fruits, other fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, potatoes, lettuce, tomatoes, other fresh vegetables, processed fruits and vegetables, canned fruits and vegetables, frozen fruits and vegetables, other processed fruits and vegetables including  dried nonalcoholic beverages and beverage materials, juices and nonalcoholic drinks, carbonated drinks, frozen noncarbonated juices and drinks, non-frozen noncarbonated juices and drinks; beverage materials including coffee and tea, coffee, other beverage materials including tea, sugar and sweets, fats and oils, butter and margarine salad dressing, other fats and oils including peanut butter, soups, frozen and freeze dried prepared foods, snacks, spices, seasonings, condiments, sauces baby food, all other miscellaneous foods

Technical proposals will be evaluated for size, quality of services and accommodations, location, and experience with large conferences.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND
The Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) is a program developed by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find in a timely manner adequate staff to cover all positions in the field, in Washington and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  OFDA's Senior Management Team (SMT) approved a program which would bring on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters.  RATS positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.

INTRODUCTION
OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (OFDA/DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM employs sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (OFDA/PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations (OFDA/OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Support Program (DASP), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The RATS program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in the OFDA/OPS Division.  This team maintains a database for all contracted RATS, providing information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  The OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified RATS for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing RATS.  Each RATS specialist will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

OBJECTIVES
The SMT has determined that OFDA needs to maintain a roster of 50 to 75 RATS to meet its surge capacity objectives.  Each incumbent will be deployable to backfill Washington positions, to field offices for staff enhancement, on DARTs and RMTs as disaster response demands, and for assessments of critical situations as warranted.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
RATS respond to humanitarian emergencies -- natural, technological and conflict-related disasters -- as required, worldwide.  The contractor may serve in the OFDA Washington offices as staff enhancement when critical shortages of staff occur and on RMTs, which provide program, administrative, technical and logistics support to OFDA DARTs from Washington.  The contractor may also be required to travel on short notice as a critical component of a U.S. Government (USG) disaster assessment team or a DART or to backfill staff members in OFDA regional or program offices overseas.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

8.  Attachment II, Statement of Work is hereby amended to incorporated the information below.  Please incorporate this information between the two following sentences:

1.	… While some of this research can be accomplished using publicly available data, some issues may require collection of new data. and 

2.  Departmental policy officials often manage and address the effects of unforeseen food and agricultural market developments such as large swings in sales volume, prices, or quantities purchased of major food products without the most up-to-date market information….  

For example, there are no public sources for current information on who is consuming what, how much, where, and what price.  Similarly, there are no public sources for important factors such as consumers’ dietary and health knowledge, attitude, purchasing behavior along with their demographic and health status. While publicly available data are based on large samples, the administration and tabulation of surveys often result in outdated information. Changing nutrition knowledge, diet fads, and food safety incidents make consumer food demand more volatile.  

9.  In the Point of Contact reference, the email address for Jehad Salameh is incorrect.  The correct email address is jsalameh@ars.usda.gov and is reflected in the following:

Point of Contact

Questions and Answers

1. Your specs state labeled herbicide rates for  Rodeo herbicide (Glyphosate) of 3-4 quarts/acre and Habitat herbicide (Imasapyr) of 4-6 pints/acre.
Can you narrow the rate range and tell us how much you want/need per acre as 3 qts of rodeo + 4 pints of Habitat are much cheaper that 4 quarts Rodeo + 6 Pints of Habitat yet both mixes are labeled.
Answer:  Please use 3 qts/acre of Rodeo and 5 pints/acre of Habitat

2. A generic formulation of Glyphosate is available for the herbicide mixes above.  This generic formulation is the same active ingredient and is labeled for you application.  Would you prefer the Rodeo or the generic product?
Answer:  Generic Glyphosate is acceptable

<DESC>This is Amendment 02 for N62645-06-R-0009, Infant Security System and Installation for Naval Medical Center San Diego. Any and all changes made in this amendment supersedes previously posted material. Only questions and responses have been included for convenience of reading.

Post site-visit for NMCSD ISS questions and answers are as follows:

SITE VISIT IMMEDIATE ISSUES

1. On the color map, there is still confusion as to the locker room area in the OB Surgery and Laboratories section. Is it NMCSD's intent to secure the doors with available resources and allow access only to personnel with need to access? This is the access path to the South passage (Catwalk to Bldg 3). This could be included in the area of coverage by installing an alarm sensor at the intersection of the catwalk and the back of the Lab area. Please clarify.

ANS: The locker rooms are already secured by NMCSD.  Only NICU & FAU personnel have access to the locker room area.  Sensors shall cover the main hallway with the windows, before and after the automated doors. 

2. In the service elevator room/hallway (central triangle area), there are 2 elevators and 6 entrance ways into that area. Does NMCSD wish to secure the six normal doors with lock and key method? Or does NMCSD intend that the Vendor secure the elevator doors with their installed system? 

ANS: (see answer as part of question three)

3. In the same service elevator area, is it intended that an alarm sensor be added to cover the access to the elevators? This includes a sub-question regarding the Automatic robot cleaning device that uses those elevators. If the vendors secure the elevator doors, would the robot cleaner interact/override the door locks? 

ANS: NMCSD does not require locking the doors on the service elevators.  Therefore, only an alarm sensor that shall alarm if an infant enters the lobby area of the service elevators is required.

4. During the site visit, it was discussed that the distance for the alarm sensors to engage the door locks and determined on 10 feet from the doors on the inside of the wings. Is this acceptable? (If "Nuisance" alarms are anticipated as a problem, a Do-not-pass line could be applied to the floor at the 10-foot boundary.)

ANS: The offeror shall determine the best means of providing the desired result based upon the design of their system.  Nuisance alarms are a concern, therefore a means to minimize them are the responsibility of the offeror.

VENDORS QUESTIONS

1.	Installers Wages – is this a Prevailing Wage Project? & if so please send us the rates to be used on the project.

ANS: Wage parameters are not set by this solicitation, or by the resultant contract. This is for the purchase of the ISS Equipment, the installation is incidental. Winning bidder must comply with local, state, and Federal regulations regarding wages.

2.	Please send Bidders List. Question 3 repeats 2.

ANS: A list of vendors attending the site visit was provided by email to those in attendance. A copy may be requested by emailing rtaylor@nmlc.med.navy.mil.

4.	Please send Full Size Copy of Floor Plans – 3rd Floor Infant Area for both bidding & asbuilts

ANS: While floor plans are available as PDF files, these drawings are only floor plans, and do not contain any of the information normally found in architectural drawings. The PDF files are available upon request by emailing rtaylor@nmlc.med.navy.mil. Only CCR registered companies will be granted access to these files.

5.	Confirm installation – Cabling above ceilings & floors can be Plenum rated, exposed areas to either be EMT Conduit or Wire Mold

ANS: The walls of the third floor are plasterboard and metal studs.  Installation of wiring/conduit on the exterior of the walls is not acceptable.  PLENUM rated cables are acceptable where regulations and codes permit. Wires that run down must be encased in conduit.

6.	Existing Security System – I would like the company name of who installed the   Change tack mats at least daily (or according to manufacture’s recommendations).

Level 3 – Rigid Barrier Precautions
To Level 1 and Level 2 controls add:
A.	Erect rigid walls at entrances and exits, or create an airtight plastic barrier prior to the beginning of the construction and demolition.  Each entrance and exit must be constructed so that it has a door or double flap of plastic to prevent the escape of dust and other airborne contaminants
B.	Isolate HVAC system in area where work is being done.  Seal all vent openings before work begins to prevent contamination of the duct system.
C.	Maintain negative pressure within work site using HEPA-equipped air filtration units.
D.	Upon completion of work, vacuum work area with HEPA filtered vacuums.  Wet mop area with hospital-grade disinfectant.


       Infection Control Precautions Needed

Construction  Activities	Type A	Type B	Type C	Type D
Low Risk Area	Level 1	Level 1	Level 2	Level 3
High Risk Area	Level 1	Level 2	Level 3	Level 3

"#26 & #42 - All of the wards are considered "high risk" areas and will require higher levels of dust containment. The hallways are considered "low risk" and a lower levels of containment can be used.  The level of containment used depends upon the work activities that may generate dust. The Infection Control Policy for Construction is attached."

<DESC>This is amendment 03 for N62645-06-R-0009, Infant Security System purchase including requiring complete install to NMCSD.

Infection Control Policy for
Construction and Renovation


Background

Fungal spores occur naturally in the environment, such as soil & plants.  These spores can also be found in plaster, building materials, ceiling tiles and dust.  The generation of dust during construction and maintenance activities may cause dispersal and dissemination of fungal spores.  Although usually not a problem for a healthy person, in the health care environment, these spores can cause serious illness or even death in some individuals.  For this reason it is important that correct infection control and dust control measures be followed during construction and maintenance activities.



Risk Areas

Buildings 1 through 6 are divided into high risk and low risk areas depending upon patient acuity and the patient care activities carried out.  Color-coded drawings designating high and low risk areas are available thorough Facilities Management.   Together with the Infection Control Section, Facilities Management will update the drawings at least annually.  Contractors planning construction or maintenance activities must review a copy of these drawings and provide appropriate barrier precautions for the designated areas.



Construction Project Activities

Construction project activities are grouped by invasiveness and potential for generating dust.

Type A – Inspection and non-invasive activities
Includes but is not limited to:
-	removal of ceiling tiles for visual inspection
-	painting (but not sanding)
-	wallcovering, electrical trim work, minor plumbing, and activities which do not generate dust or require cutting of walls or access to ceilings other than for visual inspection

Type B – Small scale, short duration activities that create minimal dust
Includes but is not limited to:
-	installation of telephone and computer cabling
-	access to chase spaces
-	cutting of walls or ceiling where dust mitigation can be controlled

Type C – Work that generates a moderate to high level of dust or requires demolition or removal of any fixed building components or assemblies
Includes but is not limited to:
-	sanding of walls for painting or wall covering
-	removal of floor coverings, ceiling tiles, and casework
-	new wall construction
-	minor duct work or electrical work above ceilings
-	major cabling activities
-	any activity which cannot be completed within a single work shift

Type D – Major demolition and construction projects
Includes, but is not limited to:
-	activities which require consecutive work shifts
-	requires heavy demolition or removal of a complete cabling system
-	new construction



Infection Control Precautions

Level 1 – Routine Infection Control Precautions
A.	Maintain manpower and equipment, including dust mops, wet mops, brooms, buckets and clean wiping cloths for cleaning fine dust from floors.
B.	Clean up dust tracked outside of work area immediately.
C.	Dampen surfaces, if needed, to control dust.
D.	Debris will be removed in tightly covered containers.
E.	Ceiling tiles removed for any reason will be replaced at the end of the workday.
F.	Affix temporary closures or make permanent repairs to any holes or openings in walls, ceilings or floors prior to leaving the area.

Level 2 – Localized Precautions
To Level 1 Routine Infection Control Procedures add:
A.	Arrange to reroute unnecessary traffic in the area and place signage indicating temporary route, if appropriate
B.	Use control cube for ceiling work if area cannot be vacated.  Control tube must extend from floor to ceiling and be dust tight.
C.	Seal doorways for projects that generate large amounts of dust.
D.	Seal or filter exhaust & ventilation ducts.  Where practical, increase exhaust in the area.
E.	Install tack mats at interior and exterior of all openings that allow egress from the work area.system & if there are items to be reused such as door holders, cameras, sensors, keypads etc. I would like to have model numbers / cut sheets.  I would also like to have Equipment Submittals, & existing asbuilts, this may help to save money on the installation for the Owner.

ANS: CEI and RFT are incumbent contractors for the existing system. See answer 49 for details. Model numbers/ cut sheets are not available. All existing equipment (cameras, doors, etc.) is the property of the government and can be reused if it is in accordance with FAR 52.211-5 (e), with government approval. (see below for attached FAR reference). Materials/equipment must be of New, Reconditioned, and Remanufactured condition.

7.	Confirm that where existing CPU Server on 3rd Floor – Janitors Closet – that this room can be used to mount New Security Equipment.  From there vendor can use the existing LAN for communications from our New panels to New Monitor Station / Server at the 1st Floor Security Room.

ANS: As the janitors closet mentioned is a wet area, it is strongly suggested that another location would be more appropriate to locate electronic components. It is recommended that the utility closet on 3 East, room number 3R-R3.2 be used.  The ward clerk has direct line of sight on this room and it is located right next to the unit LPO's office.

8.	Confirm New Door Sensors at the New door locations to work within a 10 ft radius of the doors

ANS:  Door sensors shall operate so as to comply with the requirements of the solicitation.

9.	Are there going to be Security Camera’s in the elevators?

ANS: Not for the Infant Security System install.

10.	Need sequence of operation of security door locks at new door locations (double doors) how do you want them to interface with existing fire alarm MAG door holders?

ANS: ISS installation must interface with the fire protection system and comply with the NFPA Codes. All interfaces with the Fire Protection System would be designed by the ISS contractor, approved by NMCS Facilities Management and NAVFAC Fire Protection Engineers, installed and tested by the ISS Vendor. The offeror shall propose a solution that meets both sets of requirements.

11.	Confirm the quantities of work stations, door locks, cameras, alarm sensors & exciters shown on the map given to us on the job walk 1/10/2006.

ANS:  NMCSD requires work stations in the following areas:
NICU 1 – 1; NICU 2- 1; L&D (3 West) – 1; 3North – 1; 3East – 1; Security office – 1
Total of 6 security stations in total.  
Door locks -  There shall be sufficient door securing devices to cover all the egress points of the secure area. The information was the responsibility of the offeror to determine based upon the walk-through and the drawings provided of the area. 
Number of cameras and camera placement - There shall be sufficient cameras to cover all the egress points of the secure area. The information was the responsibility of the offeror to determine based upon the walk-through and the drawings provided of the area. The camera placement shall comply with the Original Essential Characteristics as posted in N62645-R-06-0009.
Alarm sensors – There shall be sufficient alarm sensors to cover all the egress points of the secure area. The information was the responsibility of the offeror to determine based upon the walk-through and the drawings provided of the area.  Alarm sensors shall be placed in all third floor elevator lobbies.
Exciters – There shall be sufficient exciters to cover the entire square footage of the secure area without any dead zones. The information was the responsibility of the offeror to determine based upon the walk-through and the drawings provided of the area. 

12.	Vendors need clarification on the different elevator rooms that we are to protect.  

a.	It is stated in section marked “Access Control System” point - 1 – “The ISS shall lock all designated exit portals, including elevators, if protected infant is removed from the designated areas. (The ISS shall only lock a specific location and not the entire ISS-protected wing.)

b.	Then in the same section point - 4 it states “Doors and elevator doors shall be securable by the system, the elevator operation shall not be hindered by the alarm; only the protected door shall not open.

c.	This needs to be clarified.  There are sections that have elevators that have no door leading into the area so they cannot be locked to protect the elevators and other area that have too many doors leading into the area which would make it cost prohibitive to protect.

ANS:  In response to (a, b, c), in the central area of 3rd floor only need to protect the perimeter, not the service elevators.  NO ELEVATORS CARS SHALL BE PREVENTED FROM NORMAL OPERATION. ONLY THE DOORS SHALL BE SECURED ON THE MAIN PATIENT ELEVATORS ON THE THIRD FLOOR. The service elevators do not need to be secured, only monitored with alarm sensor in the 3rd floor service lobby area.

13.	The following describes the 3 ways an elevator can be protected:

a.	1 - Bank style control - which, if a tag enters the area in front lobby area of the elevators which are protected, the system will see it and enter into alarm instantly and can or will control the elevator cars (dependant on what the elevators are capable of) by either locking the elevator(s) down if they are on the floor or bypassing the floor if they are not on the floor.  This requires 1 controller per bank of elevators
b.	2 – Individual Elevator Control by Car – which, is mounted around or at each elevator individually and when a tag is detected and the door to the elevator is open the alarm would sound and the car would lock in place (dependant on what the elevators are capable of).  This requires a controller per car being protected.
c.	3 – Individual Elevator Control by Car – which, is similar to above with the exception a controlling device is mounted on top of each car, which rides the car from the basement to the roof and will detect when a tag enters the car and it will lock only that car down, not affecting the other cars.  You will require one device per elevator car

ANS:  The movement of the elevator cars shall not be hindered, the vendor shall provide a means for securing the doors from opening on the third floor main patient elevators.

14.	All of these ways of controlling the elevators would require a tie in with the elevator company in either just controlling the door hold open on the car or a full mounting and installation on the car. We will all need clarification on how you would like the elevators controlled.

ANS: See answers to 12 and 13.

15.	Under ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM, Item 4, the statement is made that "Doors and elevators shall be securable by the system, the elevator operation shall not be hindered by the alarm; only the protected door shall not open."

ANS: Do not lock the elevators down.  If a sensor tag enters the prescribed area near the door, the protected door should secure and the alarm shall activate.

16.	I am under the impression that a sophisticated Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) system is integrated closely with the operational control of the service elevators, including elevator door operation.  

a.	Is it your intent to integrate the Infant Security System with this sophisticated AGV/service elevator control system?	
b.	If so, will preventing the protected elevator door from opening adversely affect AGV system operation?

ANS: In response to (a and b), in the central area of 3rd floor , do not interface the ISS with the AGV. These are service elevators and do not require securing devices.

17.	Please clarify how you would like vendors to handle security protection for this elevator bay.

ANS: Protect the perimeter with an exciter that would detect if a sensor entered the lobby area.

18.	Who is the elevator maintenance company and what is their contact information? 

ANS: Current elevator service company - Chugach McKinley is the current Prime Contractor for elevator maintenance.  Kone, subcontractor to Chugach McKinley, actually performs the maintenance. The Chugach McKinley contact number is (619) 234-0552.

19.	Please define the elevator coverage.  To appropriately cover the service elevators, the hospital should either have all 6 exits points covered (very costly) or have one controller in the area that will allow the elevators to bypass the floor if a tag is in the field, or at least alarm if the tag is in the field.   Another option, would be to have individual elevator controls.  If a tag enters an elevator car, there would be a warning sound.  If the tag does not exit the car, an alarm will sound in 10 seconds and the door remains locked open until reset.  The other car would still be operational unless a tag enters that one. 

ANS: See answers 12-17.

20.	Where do you want the monitor for elevators, elevator lobby area or within the elevator?
	
ANS:  The vendor shall place the exciters in the hallway/lobby before the elevators.

21.	Where do you want the monitor for service elevators, elevator lobby area or within the elevator?

ANS: Service elevator lobby area.

22.	Is the winning bidder required to remove the existing infant security system as part of there bid and if so to what extent do you want the system removed (all wiring in the ceiling, all controllers, receivers, keypads on walls and existing computers if applicable), also any holes or damage to walls that is necessary when the removal occurs – is that to be patched and fixed by the facility itself or is the vendor required to do this.

ANS: Yes, the winning vendor shall ensure that any new fire or smoke barrier penetrations are sealed as specified in the solicitation.  All fire or smoke barrier penetrations created or caused by removal of the old system cables, conduit, or components shall be sealed by the winning vendor.   No wiring shall be abandoned in place.

23.	Please define the birth census at the facility – CAPT Grau stated that is was between 250 & 300 births per month and that you would require 90 tags – please confirm.

ANS: 300 per month

24.	How many tags, and of what type (i.e. infant, mother, pediatric, etc.), are required?

ANS: only infant  - 90 tags

25.	Will the tag quantity remain at 90?

ANS: 90 tags

26.	As dust containment is a requirement for this installation please forward the NMCSD Infection Control Policy regarding dust containment.  As discussed, it may only be needed in the patient wards. So please define your requirements per wards and hallways.

ANS: See posted Infection control documents in FBO (as amendment) and use in conjunction with PDF files from Question 4.

27.	Are there any area with asbestos to be concerned about and if so who will be doing the abatement?  Will the facility have this done or will you require the vendor to issue a quotation for it?

ANS: The only known asbestos is in the mastics used for flooring and coving.

28.	You have stated that we are required to complete and submit a copy of forms: Provision FAR 52.213-3 and DFARS 252.212-7000 and others – where do we get these forms – is there a web site that we can go to, to obtain them? 

ANS: http://www.arnet.gov/far/

29.	Question for staff training – how many personnel will be requiring training for the healthcare staff, security staff, maintenance, facilities, housekeeping and any other staff you may require? We need this to determine days of training required.

ANS: NURSING:  There are two 12 hr shifts (days and nights) – vendor can catch majority of staff if training days are held on Tues and Thurs.  NMCSD has 4 different units to train – NICU (60 staff), L&D (60 staff), 3E (30 staff), 3N (40 staff)

30.	How many doors need to be protected in the OB Surgery area?  There was a question as to whether or not there was a door that leads out of the locker room.

ANS: That door is cover by the FACU staff.  It leads directly to the nursing station, which is continuously manned.  OB has one back south exit, one exit/entrance to FAU, one exit/entrance to PACU, and the main double door entrance/exit (a total of 4 doors in all).

31.	Please supply floor plans and current specs for cameras.  Can camera system for the third floor be independent of the other hospital cameras, or do they need to integrate?

ANS: There are no specifications in addition to those provided by the solicitation.  This is a performance specification, and the offeror is expected to propose a solution based upon available technology. ISS cameras are independent.

32.	Can you please give me the minimum requirements of the DVR and Camera's.
a.	For instance: How many days of recording, frames per second. Lux on the camera, TV Lines etc.

ANS:  This is a performance specification, and the offeror is expected to propose a solution based upon available technology.

33.	Where do you want cameras located?  How many?
Vendor Suggestion – Place a camera on the unsecured side of exits to allow for image capture of person leaving.

ANS: Cameras are to be placed at all entrances/exits of units. Placement shall be in accordance with the Essential Characteristics.

34.	What are the recording device requirements?  (i.e. frames per second, total recording time etc.)

ANS: This is a performance specification, and the offeror is expected to propose a solution based upon available technology.

35.	What brand of camera and recording device is required?

ANS: No brand specified.

36.	Will the hospital still supply the 110 VAC at each exit point to power the controllers or will we be utilizing the existing closets the current system are residing in?

ANS: The successful vendor shall install all electrical conduit/wiring.  Facilities will work with the successful vendor to identify the electrical panels to which they can connect for electrical power.

37.	Will the hospital still supply the 110 VAC at each exit point to power the controllers?

ANS: See question 36.

38.	Where can we obtain information regarding local permit fees?

ANS: The Naval Medical Center San Diego is not subject to local or state permit requirements.  However, this does not except an employer from complying with applicable state and local laws (taxes, occupational health and safety, etc.).

39.	Where can we obtain information regarding local fees?

ANS: The Naval Medical Center San Diego is not subject to local or state permit requirements.  However, this does not except an employer from complying with applicable state and local laws (taxes, occupational health and safety, etc.).

40.	Question: The drawing you sent has a large "X" across the left side. Does this mean that this section is deleted from the scope of work?

ANS: No, the “X” was a scribbled note of no significance. No change to SOW.

41.	Can you give instructions as to how we are to become CCR registered?  Is this a pre-requisite to attend the job walk?

ANS: You may become CCR registered by visiting www.ccr.gov and following the instructions online. You shall need a DUNS number to get started, that information is also available on CCR. It is  recommended registering online, rather than by phone. (Online can be done within 3-4 days, while phone can take up to 30 days.)

No, it is not a prerequisite for attendance.  You must be CCR registered before a government contract can be awarded and in order to get paid.

42.	Where can we locate the NMCSD Infection Control Policy regarding dust containment?  As discussed, it may only be needed in the patient wards.

ANS: Attached in FBO as amendment.

43.	Is this going to be awarded to one prime vendor, or several vendors to perform each piece? If one prime vendor, then can we utilize sub contractors?
