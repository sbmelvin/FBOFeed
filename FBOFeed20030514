<DESC>NASA/SSC plans to issue a Best Value Request for Offer for Repair and Modernize 13.8kV Unit Substations.   The work for this requirement consists of, but is not limited to the following: Provide all labor, equipment, tools and materials to demolish and replace several double ended 13.8kV/480V unit substations, miscellaneous cable, switchgear and fencing.  All work elements are located below ground level at interior and exterior locations.   Note:  Some work locations are dedicated to propulsion testing.  All work under this proposed contract in these facilities will be scheduled at the convenience of propulsion testing activities.	Double ended substations will typically be worked one side at a time with one side in service at all times.  Weekend outages to accommodate total Unit Substation replacement with no energized elements may be possible depending on propulsion test operations. The order of magnitude for the procurement is $500,000 to $1,000,000.and the effort shall be completed within 365 calendar days after notice to proceed.		 Best Value Selection (BVS) seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit (including past performance, and relevant experience) of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the Offerors and the Government. BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the Offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts). However, the Government will consider awarding to an Offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value.	Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an Offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other offers warrant doing so.		 This procurement is unrestricted. The NAICS Code and small business size standard for this procurement are 238210 and $12.0 million, respectively. This procurement is part of the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program.  As a result, all qualified sources may submit a bid, which shall be considered by the agency.      The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or about June 4, 2003 with an anticipated bid closing date of on or about July 7, 2003. The firm date for receipt of bids or offers will be stated in the RFO.	 An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".	  Specifications and Drawings will only be made available on CDROM. Requests for copies shall be made by email to the Bid Distribution Office:  Anita.DeMarco-1@nasa.gov or you may fax your request to (228) 688-1141.       The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement [with the exception of the specifications and drawings] will be available over the Internet at NASA/SSC Business Opportunities page:  http://nais.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=64	   Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY TO DETERMINE AVAILABILITY of AGING EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE SUPPORT The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Aviation System Standards, Resou= rce Management Staff, AVN-27.  This market survey is a request for expressi= ons of availability of equipment and is not a solicitation and a contract a= ward is not applicable to this notice.  This market survey is for planning = purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an=  obligation on the part of the government to acquire the hardware or servic= es.

<DESC>NASA/HQ has a requirement for ISO 9001:2000 Internal Audit Services. NASA Headquarters proposes to enter into a contract with Qualitec for ISO 9001:2000 internal auditing services.  The potential contract will be for a basic period from September 1, 2003 through September 30, 2004 with 4 one-year options.  In accordance with 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source, NASA intends to award this contract to Qualitec Consulting, Inc., Candor, New York. Qualitec shall serve as an audit team member to conduct ISO 9001:2000 internal audits of the NASA Headquarters Quality Management System (QMS). NASA Headquarters is responsible for conducting up to six ISO 9001:2000 QMS internal audits beginning as early as September 1, 2003.  Audits will be scheduled evenly throughout the period to maximize the benefit to the NASA Headquarters.  Internal audits shall be one to ten days in length including up to one-half day to organize audit results and contribute to, and participate in, audit opening and exit meetings. The Government shall provide the specific dates and entities to be audited. Audits shall consist of ISO 9001:2000 compliance audits of the NASA Headquarters QMS as well as tailored QMS audits intended to improve NASA business processes and add value to NASA. Qualitec is the incumbent contractor providing audit services to NASA and is uniquely suited to continue to provide the highest quality ISO 9001 internal audits to NASA Headquarters since it has gained specialized experience critical to the success of the Headquarters ISO 9001 internal auditing function in the 4½ years that Qualitec has been engaged with the Headquarters ISO Program.  Qualitec's unique experience and understanding cannot be replicated. Qualitec has been involved in virtually all aspects of NASA HQ's ISO initiatives since September 1998. In designing and implementing the current HQ's QMS, Qualitec worked with Agency Senior Managers such as the Deputy Administrator (DA) and the Associate Deputy Administrators (ADA) and all the Enterprise and Functional Office Associate Administrators (AA) to provide consulting services that spanned both Phases 1 and 2 of the initial HQs Registration to the ISO 9001:1994 standard and the transition to the ISO 9001:2000 standard.  Qualitec was involved in the original study, planning and implementation of the HQ Quality Management System (QMS).  Qualitec performed internal gap analysis audits of all Enterprise and Functional codes at NASA Headquarters and was a principal contributor to drafting the original and subsequent revisions to the HQ Quality Management Systems Manual.  Qualitec, along with the NASA ISO Program Office, developed the current model that defines the NASA HQ QMS.  In addition, Qualitec advised senior management including the DA, ADA and applicable AAs on NASA-wide QMS implementation issues, participating in one-on-one meetings with these executives and in discussions on integrating ISO 9001 into Headquarters customer products, i.e., the NASA Strategic Planning, Budget Execution and Implementation, and the Performance Planning and Reporting processes. Qualitec was a significant contributor to the documenting of these processes and conducted subsequent internal audits and verification of these activities. Qualitec provided internal auditing and consulting services for NASA's implementation and integration of the Presidents Management Agenda, the Government Performance and Results Act, the NASA Strategic Plan and the NASA Strategic Management Handbook into the HQ Quality Management System.  Qualitec was instrumental in creating the documentation that defines these processes as well as the configuration management system and record requirements for these documents.	 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 30, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Submission of these capabilities should be by electronic mail in MICROSOFT WORD format to the following address:  Sandra.R.Russo@nasa.gov The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>NA DESCRIPTION: The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville, in support of Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base (AFB), NC seeks to identify potential responsible sources pursuant to issuing a solicitation for the privatization of its natural gas di stribution systems at the respective sites. Fort Bragg is a U.S. Army installation located adjacent to the city of Fayetteville, North Carolina. The installation covers approximately 142,000 acres, and includes Pope Air Force Base in its entirety. Privatiz ation is the conveyance of ownership of the utility system, or part of the utility distribution system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity, and the simultaneous procurement of the utility distribution  services from the new owner of the system. We will consider recommendations from potential sources on methods to reduce proposal and contract costs, types of pricing arrangements, and any other ideas that may facilitate the privatization process.  Any res ulting solicitation will not include the natural gas commodity and will not supplant existing commodity contracts. The Government will retain liability for any pre-existing environmental conditions. The conveyance of the utility distribution system is auth orized and conducted under the statute 10 U.S.C. 2688. The conveyance will transfer all rights, title, and interest of the United States Government in and to the utility distribution system. The conveyance will not include any real property. The contract t erm for the utility distribution services may be up to 50 years.   SYNOPSIS:  The existing natural gas system serves approximately 1,303 buildings located throughout the installation.  The system consists of steel and polyethylene pipe and contains over 50 miles of distribution mains and service laterals, and approximatel y 193 major valves.  The system was constructed for the most part in the 1970s with some additions in the 1990s.   The Contractor shall assume ownership of all Government-owned pressure reduction valves, flow/isolation valves, transmission piping, service laterals, regulators, meters, and other distribution facilities on Fort Bragg and Pope AFB.  Ownership shall begin at the termination point between North Carolina Natural Gas and Government lines and extend to the low-pressure side of each building regulator connection point. For all services, the Government (or housing privatization Contractor) shall assume responsibi lity on the low-pressure side of the building regulator connection point. It should be noted that North Carolina Natural Gas owns sections of the natural gas distribution system to include all of Housing Areas (HA) 14 and 15 and part of the system that ser ves HA-13.  They also own the mains (above 8 in diameter).  North Carolina Natural Gas will continue to own these sections of the natural gas distribution system even if a Contractor is awarded the Government-owned sections of the system.  System pressure distributed to the post varies at different locations.  Additionally, there are gas distribution lines and equipment owned, operated and maintained by Honeywell.  Honeywell will continue to own these sections of the natural gas distribution system until th ey are conveyed to the Government (at a future date.  After transfer from Honeywell, the Government will convey the additional system elements to the contractor selected in this contract action.    General Description of the System. The Fort Bragg natural gas distribution system consists of, but is not limited to: a.  A metering and pressure reduction station located within the perimeter of the Installation. b.  Approximately 262,700 linear feet (50 miles) of pipe, ranging in sizes from less than 2in to 8in in diameter.  Installed pipe is polyethylene or steel. The steel pipe is coated and wrapped.   c.

<DESC>ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENT TO AWARD CONTRACTS FOR THE STAND-ALONE TOWER DISPLAY SYSTEM (SATDS) On August 1, 2002, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an INTERNET announcement stating that the FAA was conducting an industry-wide market survey for vendors' systems to fulfill the requirements for the Stand Alone Tower Display System (SATDS).  The announcement stated that to the FAA's knowledge, there were only two systems that met the SATDS requirements--Lockheed Martin Corporation's ARTS IE and Raytheon Company's STARS LITE. This INTERNET announcement requested information from industry on any systems that met the following SATDS Functional requirements: Conflict Alert (CA) safety functions; Mode C Intruder (MCI) safety functions; Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) safety functions; Primary and secondary radar(s) target identification; alphanumeric capabilities (data blocks, Lists); and weather information services. Due to the expedited schedule for this procurement, the offering was limited to vendors with pre-existing, fielded, FAA-Certified, United States of America National Airspace Systems (NAS) real-time terminal air traffic control automation systems.  Industry was given 2 weeks to respond if they had a system that met the SATDS requirements. In addition to the information the FAA had on the STARS LITE and ARTS IE systems, the FAA received three formal responses of which two did not meet the SATDS requirements. The third responder claimed to meet the requirements but chose not to be considered for the SATDS requirement.  Based on the outcome of the market survey, the FAA determined that only the STARS LITE and ARTS IE systems met all the requirements listed in the SATDS Market Survey INTERNET announcement.  Therefore, it is the intent of the FAA to award a contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation and, at a future date, one to Raytheon Company for a combined total acquisition of up to 30 SATDSs for FAA and general aviation sites.

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA). The overall objective of the B-2 Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) program is to provide the B-2 bomber, Link-16 Situational Awareness (SA) BLOS B-2 capability.  The B-2 BLOS program shall provide SA to the flight deck via satellite reception of Link-16 data from networks beyond the horizon. This announcement constitutes a notice to all potential offerors that, on or about 26 May, 2003, the Tactical Data Links System Program Office, Gateways Division (TDL) anticipates the release on the HERBB website (www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil) of a Request for Proposal for the B-2 BLOS program.  The overall objective of the B-2 BLOS program is to provide the B-2 Bomber, Link-16 Situational Awareness (SA) BLOS.  The B-2 BLOS system will be acquired using a split submission of proposals.  A technical demonstration of proposed systems will be conducted at Hanscom AFB, MA tentatively the week of 23 Jun 03. Offerors will be required to submit a technical proposal with ROM as well as the technical demonstration of the proposed system.  The government reserves the right to award without discussion.  Throughout this process, the offeror is free to submit change pages to the technical proposal, which in fact is the intent of this split submission process.  As the government is going through the evaluation and demonstration/oral presentation part of this process and talking and interacting with the Offerors, the Offerors themselves should be updating and refining their technical proposal.  When the government has finished its "extended market survey", each offeror will be asked to submit a complete proposal; e.g. any final change pages to its technical proposal, and a full cost proposal based on the final version of its technical proposal.  The contract will be a cost type contract with an estimated value of less than $3M. The B-2 BLOS program shall provide SA to the flight deck via satellite reception of Link-16 data from networks beyond the horizon.  This capability will be met by the Offerors' provision of software that will allow receipt of J-series messages.  The software must have an interface to the PRC-117 SATCOM radio, support an interface to FALCONVIEW software, ability to receive Satellite TADIL J (Mil-Std 6016B) and Mil-Std 3011 App. A protocols, and must accept GPS position/timing information.  The system must support the B-2 Situational Awareness and Communications Upgrade (SACU).  Offerors will be provided 30 days from official release to respond to the RFP with the technical proposal.  Telephone requests for the RFP will not be accepted.  Firms responding to this request shall indicate whether they are a large business, small business, very small business, small-disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business. Respondents must specify whether they are a U.S. or foreign-owned firm. Interested Contractors desiring to do business with the Air Force shall be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Reporting System.  This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposal, and it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Contractors are reminded and cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.   Interested Contractors who have Advisory and Assistance Services contracts and also support ESC/DIV are put on notice that you may have a potential Organizational Conflict of Interest.  If you desire to submit a proposal in response to the above RFP, an OCI mitigation plan will be required. This plan will be evaluated to determine if an actual OCI exists and whether sufficient safeguards exist to make you eligible for award. Failure to submit such plan may make you ineligible for award.  Please direct any questions on this NOCA to ESC/DIVG, 45 Arnold Street, Hanscom AFB MA 01731-2103, Attn: Mr. Kent Kinal, Contracting Officer (tel: 781-377-1273, e-mail: kent.kinal@hanscom.af.mil) or Mr. Jeff Wong, Contracts Manager (tel: 781-377-2326, e-mail: Jeffrey.wong@hanscom.af.mil).

<ARCHDATE>06282003
<CONTACT>JOSHUA M. BOWERS, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513-487-2104, E-Mail: bowers.joshua@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. EPA, National Center for Environmental Assessment, located in Washington, DC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Wayne Berman to complete a project entitled "Study to Better Characterize Historical Asbestos Exposures." In the current IRIS profile there are a few uncertainties in unit cancer risk assessment. To reduce these uncertainties a reconciliation of disparities in current epidemiologic studies is warranted.  The best way to evaluate the  risk-per-unit-dose observed across the available epidemiologic studies would be to provide more detailed characterizations of the dusts to which the various asbestos workers were exposed and then to correlate associations across studies. Ideally, this could be accomplished by re-analyzing archived air sample filters that were used to characterize exposure in the original studies.  However, such archived filters do not appear to exist. Because archived air samples do not appear to exist, the next best opportunity for characterizing the historical exposures is to collect appropriate samples of bulk materials representing the bulk materials handled by the various exposed cohorts and to analyze them using a method that allows for the characterization of dusts created from these samples.  Thus, a project is needed in which appropriate bulk samples would be collected and analyzed using this method to provide a better characterization of historical exposures.   This notice is not a request for quotations. EPA source research indicates Dr. Wayne Berman is the only known contractor with the appropriate level of technical knowledge necessary to complete this project. Dr. Berman developed a unique understanding of the operations, history, and the characteristics of ore deposits located in Quebec under a pilot study conducted for EPA last year. He possesses unique expertise in the area of risk assessment, exposure assessment, site investigation, and has developed methods capable of providing measurements of asbestos fibers that relate directly to risk and a new protocol for improved evaluation of asbestos for use in dose-response analysis. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of completing such work. Any such documentation must be submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice (before 5:00 PM Thursday, May 29, 2003). Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710.  The anticipated award date is August 1, 2003. Interested parties should submit their technical documentation to Mr. Josh Bowers, using the following methods: 1.) by fax to 513.487.2109, or 2.) by email (bowers.joshua@epa.gov) referencing "Study to Better Characterize Historical Asbestos Exposures."

<DESC>The Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT) has a requirement to solicit additional proposals and expand its research program entitled, “Innate Immune Receptors and Adjuvant Discovery.” This particular research begins at the discovery/molecular response evaluation stage and progresses to Preclinical testing of new adjuvants based upon triggering of the human innate immune system.  Adjuvants are defined as molecules that act via innate immune system signaling to activate desired innate and adaptive (T-cell and antibody-mediated) immune responses.  The adjuvant products aimed for in this program may encompass uses both as vaccine adjuvants, to elicit T- and B cell responses when co-administered with an immunogen, as well as stand-alone immunomodulators to stimulate short term protective responses against broad categories of infectious agents.  Research must be directed toward vaccine adjuvants and immune stimulation strategies to defend against NIAID categories A, B, or C agents. NIAID intends to release a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) request for proposals (RFP) in order to solicit competitive proposals for this acquisition.

It is anticipated that up to five (5) cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of five (5) years, beginning approximately May 30, 2004.

<DESC>In the past, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has used four separate thermal-hydraulic codes (RELAP5, TRAC-P, TRAC-B, and RAMONA) to analyze plant transients and the loss-of-coolant accidents in the light water reactors.  The results were used to support licensing decisions.  For technical reasons and maintenance cost reduction, the NRC has consolidated these four codes into a single TRAC-M code that needs to be capable of analyzing a broad spectrum of accidents and transients to support licensing decisions.  The contractor shall provide technical assistance on a task order basis to perform experiments, collect data, and provide models to support the consolidated TRAC-M code.  The contractor shall provide the personnel, facilities, and equipment required to accomplish this objective.  It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract.  The period of performance of the resultant contract will be three (3) years.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available around November 8, 2002, and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)issued a Request For Information (RFI) to identify industry's interest in the design and construction of a Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull (SWATH) vessel and industry's comments on alternate acquisition approaches (Lease/Charter or Design and Construction).  After  consideration of RFI responses, NOAA has determined that a contract for the design and construction of the SWATH vessel is the best approach.  NOAA's acquisition strategy is two phase multiple awards, consisting of Phase I,  Feasibility Study and Preliminary Design, and assuming suitable and affordable designs are developed in Phase I, followed by a Phase II option,  which consists of a Contract Design and a option for Detail Design and Construction.  Up to two offerors will be awarded a firm-fixed price Phase I contract in the amount of $150,000.00.  The RFP is expected to be full and open competition for all responsible sources.  Offerors must identify contractor teaming/partner arrangements having both design and construction (shipyard) capabilities in one legally formed entity for purposes of contract award and performance.  A Fixed Price Incentive Fee contract is planned.  NOAA's current release date for the RFP is mid to late June 2003. 

Responses to this RFI are not required.  Firms that responded to NOAA's previous SWATH market surveys, Reference Number-02-SWATH in April 2002 and Reference Number-03-SWATH in November 2002, are not required to respond to this announcement.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued a Request For Information (RFI) to identify industry's interest in the design and construction of a Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull (SWATH) vessel and industry's comments on alternate acquisition approaches (Lease/Charter or Design and Construction).  After consideration of RFI responses, NOAA has determined that a contract for the design and construction of the SWATH vessel is the best approach.  NOAA's acquisition strategy is two phase multiple awards, consisting of Phase I,  Feasibility Study and Preliminary Design, and assuming suitable and affordable designs are developed in Phase I, followed by a Phase II option, which consists of a Contract Design and a option for Detail Design and Construction.  Up to two offerors will be awarded a firm-fixed price Phase I contract in the amount of $150,000.00.  The RFP is expected to be full and open competition for all responsible sources.  Offerors must identify contractor teaming/partner arrangements having both design and construction (shipyard) capabilities in one legally formed entity for purposes of contract award and performance.  A Fixed Price Incentive Fee contract is planned.  NOAA's current release date for the RFP is mid to late June 2003. 

Responses to this RFI are not required.  Firms that responded to NOAA's previous SWATH market surveys, Reference Number-02-SWATH in April 2002 and Reference Number-03-SWATH in November 2002, are not required to respond to this announcement.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>SUMMARY: The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is seeking proposals from companies in the form of capability statements for Clinical Trials to provide  
1)	insulin,
2)      statin,
3)      ACE inhibitor,
4)	equipment needed for the care of children with type 2 diabetes (including glucose meters and strips, syringes, lancets, urine ketone strips, concentrated glucose solution for performing oral glucose tolerance tests, topical anesthetic cream for blood drawing, automated blood pressure devices and cuffs, automated scales),
5)	equipment required to measure the effects of lifestyle change (including mechanically breaked cycle ergometers, heart rate monitors and electronic metronomes for performing PWC, accelerometers, pedometers),
6)	materials to create a “toolbox” to be utilized to enhance the ability of underprivileged children to attain lifestyle changes, particularly increased physical activity (including sneakers, jump ropes, etc.)

STUDY GOAL: The overall goal of this study is to evaluate potential treatment modalities for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, to determine the safest and most efficacious options for treatment. Twelve clinical centers will enroll a total of approximately 750 patients. For medical care, subjects will be seen every 2 months during the first year, and every 3 months during the subsequent years. The total duration of the trial is 5 years. The primary outcome will be related to the achievement and maintenance of glycemic control; numerous important secondary outcomes will also be evaluated, including preservation of beta cell function, side effects and quality of life, markers for vascular complications, and cost effectiveness. 
	Applicants for a Clinical Trial Agreement to support this clinical trial must include a description of the staff with experience and expertise to collaborate in multicenter clinical studies of patients with diabetes. Applicants should provide a detailed description of the materials or equipment to be provided. How the drug or product will be sent to each participating center, as well as packaging, storing and accountability issues must be presented. 

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS: A selection committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations. It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the selection committee through their capability statements. The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages and should address the following selection criteria:
1.	The statement should provide specific details about the product to be supplied, particularly any validation of its use in a pediatric population, and in obese subjects, if relevant.
2.	The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the product in a timely manner for the duration of the study.
3.	The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator. 

DATES: Only written Clinical Trial capability statements received by the NIDDK on or before April 19, 2003 will be considered. Applicants meeting the criteria as set forth in this announcement will be invited, at the Collaborator’s expense, to discuss their plans, capabilities, and research findings pertinent to the study at a meeting of the Steering Committee, date and place to be determined. The Institute may issue an additional notice of Clinical Trial opportunity. This notice is directed toward companies with resources to support collaborations.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND QUESTIONS: Capability statements should be submitted to Rochelle Blaustein, J.D., Director, Technology Transfer and Development, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 12 South Drive, MSC 5632, Bethesda, MD  20892-5632, rochelleb@intra.niddk.nih.gov, Fax:  301-402-7461.

<DESC>NA This notice of contract action is a modification of the schedules posted in the HERBB including NOCA RFP release on 29 August 2002, Sources Sought Synopsis Amendment posted on 23 July 2002, and Sources Sought Synopsis posted on 11 July 2002.  This announcement constitutes an updated notice to all potential lead offerors that, on 30 May 2003, the Joint Stars/Multi-Platform Command and Control Aircraft Program Office (JS/MA) anticipates the release on the HERBB website (www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil) of a Request for Proposal RFP, (F19628-02-R-0056), for the MC2A BMC2 subsystem selection.  The overall objective of the BMC2 program is to design, develop, integrate, and test a BMC2 subsystem for the MC2A weapon system. The MC2A is the key piece of the MC2 Constellation that will extend the commander's eyes and ears while serving as the primary element of the C2 architecture.  MC2A will deliver Ground Moving Target Indicator capability and Air Moving Target Indicator capabilities to support the Cruise missile Defense operations, along with BMC2 capabilities integrated on a Boeing 767-400ER platform. The MC2A will be fully integrated within architecture of joint combat and ISR systems, space-based systems, and all-source intelligence exploitation systems to achieve the highest predictive battlespace awareness.  The BMC2 subsystem includes all of the non-radar and non-aircraft subsystems including the central computing architecture, networks, data storage, data manipulation, data correlation/fusion, data exploitation, communications and data link capability. The MC2A BMC2 contractor will provide improvements in the quality and timeliness of information to support more rapid decision analysis, increased battlespace awareness, and shorter decision cycle to advance information superiority and precision engagement.  The MC2A BMC2 subsystem will allow for future capability growth, utilize Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) to the maximum extent possible, be Common Operating Environment (COE) compliant and utilize open systems architecture to achieve the highest levels of systems interoperability.  It will handle data at multiple security levels and will fuse on and off board data to create a common operating picture. To speed delivery and allow insertion of new technologies / capabilities, an evolutionary acquisition approach is planned for the MC2A weapon system. The government intends to conduct the BMC2 selection process in two phases. The first phase involves the award of multiple firm fixed price BMC2 contracts for the BMC2 Offerors to independently team with the MC2A WSI contractor and execute the Pre-System Development Design (Pre-SDD) development through the System Requirements Review (SRR).  The second phase will begin following a down select to a single BMC2 directed source for the Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) MC2A WSI to complete Pre-SDD and SDD. The BMC2 directed source will be selected by the Government through proposal evaluation and demonstrations followed by MC2A WSI subcontract award.  The BMC2 subsystem rough order of magnitude estimate is approximately $400 Million for the Pre-SDD and SDD effort. Past performance information will be due on 15 June 2003.  Technical and cost proposals are due by 1 July 2003. REQUESTS FOR THE RFP: Teams or Prime Contractors interested in competing in this acquisition must affirm or re-affirm interest by submitting a request for the RFP by 29 May 2003.  These interested parties must follow the instructions below: 1.  Submit a request to ericka.dailey@hanscom.af.mil or alternate David.Bennett@hanscom.af.mil by 29 May 2003 12:00 pm est.; telephone requests for the RFP will not be accepted. 2.  Firms responding to this request shall indicate whether they are a large business, small business, very small business, small-disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business. 3.  Foreign-owned firms, including Canadian sources, are not eligible to compete. 4.  Interested Contractors desiring business with the Air Force shall be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Reporting System. This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposal.  It does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.   Contractors are reminded and cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<SUBJECT>A -- Scientific investigations of living donor liver transplantation using clinical information and tissue and blood samples from adult liver transplant recipients
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-DK-02-0151
<RESPDATE>061303

<CONTACT>Rochelle  Blaustein J.D., Director, Technology Transfer and Development, Phone 301-451-3636, Fax 301-401-7461, Email rochelleb@intra.niddk.nih.gov - Linda Schilling, Technology Development Specialist, Phone 301-451-3638, Fax 301-402-7461, Email lindas@intra.niddk.nih.gov
<DESC>Collaboration in scientific investigations of living donor liver transplantation using clinical information and tissue and blood samples from adult liver transplant recipients in the areas of cellular and genetic aspects of liver regeneration; liver function and metabolic mass;  markers of liver injury and repair; treatment of hepatitis C; hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer); immunosuppression and  immune tolerance; drug metabolism; gene expression; psychometric measures of quality of life; electronic media for patient education; and other scientific issues relevant to living donor liver transplantation.

SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies) to investigate scientific issues in the recently formed Clinical Research Network termed Adult to Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort Study (A2ALL). The core theme of A2ALL is comparison of outcomes of candidates for liver transplant who receive or do not receive Living Donor Transplantation (LDT).  See http://www.nih-a2all.org/default.asp for more information and list of participating centers.  The potential Collaborator’s capability statement should provide proof of expertise in the design and implementation of studies of the relevant area of investigation and should include the scientific rationale for the study proposed, proposed methods, and access to potential therapeutic or diagnostic molecules. Examples of potential studies include: 1) Characterization of changes in LIVER FUNCTION, mass, and metabolic capacity during regeneration following liver transplantation. The impact of changing liver function on the immune response as well as its effect on metabolism of immunosuppressants could be investigated using novel biochemical and imaging techniques.  2) Identification of host GENETIC FACTORS associated with LIVER REGENERATION and the syndrome of graft failure due to inadequate liver mass.  This will require the identification of genes involved in successful liver regeneration in humans, as well as pathophysiologic events in the failure of grafts. 3) Assessment of the interrelationship of LDT with IMMUNOSUPPRESSION.  Cylosporine, tacrolimus, and other immunosuppressive drugs have been associated with proliferative effects which impact liver regeneration. In addition, changes in liver function affect the pharmacokinetics of most immunosuppression.  4) Exploration of serum markers for LIVER INJURY and repair to predict hepatic histology either by themselves or in combination with other clinical and laboratory variables.  Also, the utility of these serum markers as surrogate markers of therapeutic response in study subjects participating in treatment trials.  5) Evaluation of the impact of liver regeneration on the KINETICS OF VIRAL REPLICATION in subjects with HEPATITIS C, and the impact of INTERFERONS and other therapeutic molecules on these phenomena.  6)  Prevention of liver injury from recurrence of hepatitis C in LDT recipients by pre- and post-transplant TREATMENT OF HEPATITIS C.  7)  Improved staging and treatment of HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA.  8)  Develop GENE EXPRESSION ARRAYS that are diagnostic of liver regeneration and repair and would provide staging and grading of the degree of cell injury, STEATOSIS AND FIBROSIS in the liver as well as insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.  9)  Study novel approaches to tolerance induction in a defined cohort of patients being prepared for elective transplantation from living donors.  10) Study the process of INFORMED UNDERSTANDING of living liver donors using ELECTRONIC MEDIA EDUCATION technology to provide patient information and correlate understanding with outcomes.  11) Development of effective PSYCHOMETRIC INSTRUMENTS to evaluate the QUALITY OF LIFE effects of living donation in this cohort of patients who will be followed long term. 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  STUDY GOAL:  The overall goal of this study is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with LDT using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy patients undergoing liver transplantation and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by development of a structured, prospective database on patients who are evaluated for LDT and either undergo LDT or instead, for various reasons, receive cadaveric livers or do not undergo transplantation at all.  Blood and tissue samples will be collected from all donors and recipients at pre-determined time points. 
Applicants to support this study must include a description of investigators and staff that would facilitate collaboration in multicenter clinical studies of liver transplant patients.  Applicants should provide a detailed description of the methods and drugs which might be used.  A description of the laboratory tests that are needed including assays to determine levels of target molecules or the genes encoding them along with appropriate methods for performing them should be provided, as well as other core facilities and interactions with core facilities that are needed.  Also included should be the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.  If an intervention is proposed, how the drug or product will be sent to each participating center as well as packaging, storing, and accountability issues must be presented.

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the collaborator’s capability statements received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their capability statements.  The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages and should address the following selection criteria: 1) The statement should provide specific details of the methods to be utilized and clearly describe important issues surrounding the proposed tests and technology. 2) The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the required materials or agents in a timely manner for the duration of the study.  3) The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator.  The specifics of the proposed outcome measures and the proposed support should include but not be limited to treatment and evaluation of LDT, specific funding commitment to support the advancement of scientific research, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, or other resources that would contribute to the conduct of the commercial development. 4) The statement must address willingness to promptly publish research results.

DATES:  Only written capability statements received by NIDDK by close of business May 15, 2003, will be considered.   Applicants meeting the criteria as set forth in this announcement will be invited at the Applicants’ own expense to discuss their plans, capabilities, and research findings pertinent to the study at a meeting of the Study’s Steering Committee in Washington D.C. on May 29-30, 2003.

<DESC>FDIC is seeking sources to assist the FDIC in implementing a skills initiative to identify the skills required to perform successfully in specific job titles, including the required proficiency levels.  We also looking to maintain the skills inventory for employees in those job titles, in order to identify the skill gaps and provide training interventions or other experiences to fill those gaps.  Many job titles at the FDIC are in areas which are widely found at other organizations.  In order to conserve resources, we would like to determine what commercially-available inventories of job-skills already exist.  

We are, initially, specifically interested in jobs-skills databases in these areas:
Financial areas, such as:
•	Accountants, Financial Analysts, and Auditors and
Positions in the Information Technology area 

However, we anticipate eventually covering all jobs across the FDIC, so we would like to also know what other job areas may have already been inventoried.

The information we are requesting for existing jobs-skills inventories is:
•	A description of the elements involved in the inventory (skills, proficiency scale, job titles, learning resources) and how they are organized
•	A few sample pages demonstrating the layout and approach of the inventory
•	A listing of the various job series which are available (i.e., financial, IT, Personnel, etc.) and the job titles covered in each.

This is not a request for competitive proposals.  The purpose of this notice is to develop a list of qualified firms that can provide the service.  A response to this request for information does not guarantee that a firm will be solicited on any solicitation issued as a result of this request for information.  The FDIC would like to receive all responses by Friday, May 30, 2003, no later than 2:00 p.m. local time.  Also please provide information as to whether your solution is on the GSA Schedule.  Responses should be ten single-spaced pages in length or less.  Firms responding to this announcement which fail to provide the required information may not be considered for inclusion into any resulting source list.  FACSIMILE AND TELEPHONE RESPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<ARCHDATE>08192003
<CONTACT>Donna McCallum, 732-532-2604
<DESC>NA The US Army RDECOM, Night Vision & Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) is conducting an industry survey for TASS-TMD, which is to evaluate and demonstrate the technical maturity of ground-based ATR for Army scout applications in order to satisfy FCS Inc rement 1 decisions. TASS-TMD will utilize a mobile sensor suite to include gimbal-scanned LWIR (SADA II), range-gated SWIR, and MTI radar. Multiple sensor data collection opportunities are anticipated in FY04-05 with real-time demonstrations in mid-FY06. Sources would be expected to tune their existing single-color LWIR algorithm for ground-based target acquisition and integrate range-gated SWIR for a long-range ID capability. Sources may incorporate information from other sensors or data as appropriate, e .g. MTI radar, LRF, DTED, etc. Sources would participate in Government blind-testing on data throughout the program, and participate in multiple real-time demonstrations, preferably with their own processing hardware, during the final year.   Those sources who have an established ATR capability, including the ability to process digital infrared imagery, automatically detect vehicles and other targets in a variety of clutter backgrounds, and have a maturing method for target recognition/ID are e ncouraged to submit a white paper (5 pages or less) on their capability and experience. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Sources without a recent history in ATR with NVESD may be able to participate in a self evaluation with NVESD data .  Note that this will not be an ATR algorithm or processor development program, but rather an ATR evaluation and demonstration with the opportunity for phases of test/fix/test prior to demonstration. Evaluation of the white papers received from sources will be based primarily on the maturity of their ATR capability, past performance, and relevance of their ATR to FCS. This request for information (RFI)/sources sought (SS) notice is for information and planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the US Army RDECOM. The purpose of this RFI/SS is to identify poten tial sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. US Army RDECOM does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for NVESD's use o f such information. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of NVESD's evaluation of the information received. SUBMISSION: Responses to this RFI should be submitted no later 4:00 pm EDT on 20 JUNE 2003. An original and one copy shall be sent to Night Vision & Electronic Sensors Directorate, Attn: AMSEL-RD-NV-GCSD, Mark Gahler, Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060.

<SUBJECT>63--Electronic Trip Flare (ETF)
<SOLNBR>DAAB15-03-R-XETF
<RESPDATE>061603
<ARCHDATE>08152003
<CONTACT>Mary Byrd, 703-325-1714
<DESC>NA This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The purpose of this announcement is to request identification of potential sources from industry for the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s Electronic Trip Flare (ETF) acquisition. The ETF is primarily a security illumination/sensor system emplaced by an individual soldier capable of use in mass or multiple systems within a local area for enhanced security for a team, platoon, or larger element.  The ETF will be a simple, compact, mo dular and lightweight motion-activated sensor warning system that will be used either as a stand-alone device or as a supplemental device with other security measures.  The ETF consists of one basic motion sensor/light/speaker/control module with infrared capability, one battery module, and one remote control command transceiver in a carrying/mounting case.  The ETF procurement will be managed by the materiel developer, the Office of the Product Manager, Physical Security Equipment (PM-PSE), at Fort Belvoir, VA.  The U.S. Army Military Police School (USAMPS) is the combat developer.   The ETF will use numerous current and future technologies to enhance security for units and individuals into the 21st century.  Non-developmental items (NDI) and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) systems will be used to the maximum extent possible.  The ETF will incorporate a high reliability sensor, bright illumination, system security features and an energy efficient design in a rugged, weatherproof and lightweight case.  The ETF, initially, will be a stand-alone system with an open architecture capable of being integrated into future tactical security systems.  ETF will improve local area security and protection of individuals and units with its quick set-up, high reliability, and operator selected configurations. In 2001, a Technical Support Working Group initiative was successful in the development of a prototype ETF system which underwent an Early Users Appraisal (EUA) at Fort Leonard Wood, MO in 2002. Tactical forces require supplemental warning devices with programmable notification capabilities in support of the mobility and survivability Battlefield Operating System (BOS).  The deployment scenarios include two major security missions, integrated peri meter security and temporary security augmentation.  Specific mobility functions enhanced by the use of ETF would include facilitating movement on routes (with secure, manned traffic control points and checkpoints), and during the preparation and emplaceme nt of constructed obstacles.  Survivability functions enhanced by using ETF would include protecting individuals and systems from combat area hazards (with prepared and protected positions), providing early warning of incursions, OPSEC (physical security),  deception in support of tactical operations (such as deployment at dummy positions), providing security for tactical formations within perimeters, augmenting law and order operations such as security of facilities--both temporary and permanent to include protection of personnel and facilities from terrorist activities, the conduct of internment and resettlement (for improving the security of facilities for Enemy Prisoners of War, Civilian Internees, US military prisoners, and dislocated civilians).  The ET F will be capable of programmed responses ranging from illumination, infrared illumination, strobe, audible alarm, or a combination of both light and sound combinations, or as a silent alarm as determined by the operator.  The ETF can be used when permanen t or semi-permanent detection systems are not feasible for use. Tactical units and security forces historically require early detection and warning of both personnel and vehicles in order to enhance their effectiveness and survivability during all types of combat operations.  This capability for early detection, warnin g and reporting of intrusions into areas of concern will provide commanders with more time to determine the most effective and appropriate tactical response.   The ETF can be used as an independent or individually employed early warning device, or as part of a security layer concept.  The ETF, through preplanned program improvement (P3I), will be capable of being integrated into other items of Family of Integra ted Tactical Security System (FITSS). The complete ETF system includes the basic ETF configuration, an additional battery module, a power supply/recharger module, and an accessory carrying case with accessories.  The ETF will be capable of functions and capabilities not provided with its obsol ete predecessor, the M49A1 Surface Trip Flare. Maintenance support of the ETF may consist of several levels, however, a study will be performed by the Program Management Office to determine the most cost effective method.  At a minimum, the operator will be responsible for the installation, operation, and daily maintenance (changing batteries, cleaning, and troubleshooting. The ETF contractor will be required to provide hardware, software and services (training, maintenance and documentation).  In the interest of acquisition streamlining, the Government's draft acquisition strategy will be to combine the System Development an d Demonstration (SDD) phase with options for the Production phase in a single solicitation and contract.  The SDD phase portion of the contract will be reimbursed on a Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) basis and will be about 2 years in duration.  The optiona l Production phase will contain Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity ordering provisions and consists of Firm Fixed Price, and Fixed-Price Incentive-Successive Target CLINs.  The Production phase will be up to three years in duration.  The maximum valu e of the Production phase is 15,000 systems.  Total contract life will not exceed 5 years.  Offerors will be required to propose fixed prices for non-developmental CLINs and ceiling prices for developmental CLINs.  Fixed prices for developmental items will  be negotiated after completion of First Article Test (FAT).  The source selection will be Best Value and will use a Tradeoff process. In preparation for the release of the ETF Request for Proposal (RFP), the Government is seeking sources from industry for the acquisition discussed in this announcement.  The ETF Draft Concept of Operations (ETFConOpns3.doc), Requirements Matrix (CDDTableC rosswalk.doc), Operational Requirements Document (ETF ORD.pdf) and Ã¢Â€ÂœSources SoughtÃ¢Â€Â questionnaire (Questions.doc) are posted on the Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP) Ã¢Â€Â“ Army Single Face to Industry at Ã¢Â€Âœhttp://abop.monmouth.a rmy.mil/Ã¢Â€Â.

<DESC>The following information is provided to do a Market Survey of Industry to determine potential contractors, in addition to  Ducommun Technologies, Inc., who have the skills, experience and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort.  Minuteman and Peacekeeper Launch Facility (LF) and Launch Control Facility (LCF) Motor-Generators (M-G’s) are to be Repaired and Modified (NSNs 6125-01-034-3374AH, NSN 6125 00 539 0330AH, 6125 01 309 5870AH and 6125 01 309 5687AH).  Workload requirements will be variable and could vary from zero to 25 units per quarter.  The contractor shall receive, disassemble, inspect, test, fault isolate, perform maintenance and modify as required to restore the unit to the latest serviceable configuration. Repairs will require metalizing, sleeving, welding, cadmium plating, machining, rewinding, balancing, electronic modules/subassemblies dis-assembly/assembly and other repairs to return the components and equipment to drawing dimensions and updated configuration.    In order to maintain alignment of the single motor and generator shafts and prevent electrical knocking, extremely tight machining tolerances and precision assembly are required.  Special test equipment which can warm-up, burn-in, fault isolate and acceptance test the repaired motor-generators is required.  This requires variable dc supplies over ranges of 32.25 + 6.25 vdc and 162.65 + 25.85 vdc and a three phase variable ac supply with voltages from 82 to 132 volts and frequencies of 55-65 Hz.  Loads banks of: a 60 Hz 7.5 KVA single phase at power factors from 0.5 lagging to 1.0 and 8.3 KW at 0.5 and 1.0 power factor, a 400 Hz 7.5 KVA three phase at power factors from 0.5 lagging to 1.0, a single phase 5 KW full-wave rectified load for the 60 Hz M-G output, a three phase 5 KW and 2.6 KW full-wave rectified load for the 400 Hz M-G set output, a 60 Hz single phase load capable of operation up to 3.75 KW at unity power factor for warm up and burn in and a 400 Hz three phase load bank capable of operating up to 3.75 KVA at unity power factor for warm up and burn-in.  An ambient cooling air supply at 32 LB/min per minute is required for LCF motor-generators.  An electronic test bench is also required for testing electronic modules and subassemblies.  Measurement and recording of M-G vibration (displacement and velocity) is required.  The test equipment must measure and record each ac input phase voltage, frequency and current, the dc input voltage and current and each output phase (both 60 Hz and 400 Hz) voltage, current, and frequency.  A computerized data collection system is required to collect, store measured data and printout at end of the testing.   
The Motor-Generators are unique to the Minuteman and Peacekeeper Weapon Systems for supplying an un-interruptible operational source of power to Missile Launch Control and Launch Facilities.  The LF M-G units weighing 2130 lbs. consist of a 120/208 volt, 3 phase, 4 wire, 60 Hz induction ac motor and a 32 volt, 13.5 HP dc motor combined on a single shaft to drive an ac generator with an output voltage of 120/208 volts ac (+2%), 3 phase, 4 wire, 380 to 435 Hz with a power output of 7.5 KVA at any power factor from 0.5 lagging to unity. The unit incorporates an electronic control box, which monitors both input frequency and voltage and transfers the motor to dc in the event ac power goes out of tolerance.  The LCF M-G units weighing 3050 lbs. consist of a 120/208 volt, 3 phase, 4 wire, 60 Hz

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential sources to privatize applicable electric distribution, water distribution and wastewater collection systems at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii and electric and water distribution systems at Bellows Air Force Station, Waimanalo, Hawaii.

The Hickam AFB, HI Electric Distribution System is power supplied from two Hawaiian Electric Company (HECO) sources at 46 kV.  The HECO sources are overhead to near the Base’s “Front Station” where HECO-owned transformers step the voltage down to 12.47/7.2 kV for distribution throughout the Base.  Base power distribution lines are both overhead and underground and serve a combination of Base housing units, office-type facilities, and mission support facilities.  In addition to the Front Station switchgear, there is the “Back Station” which includes switchgear for distribution to the southern portion of the Base.  Two underground express feeders connect the Front Station to the Back Station.  Additional feeders provide a loop between the two stations.  There are approximately 20 miles of overhead primary distribution, 26 miles of underground distribution, and approximately 500 building service step-down transformers.  The 1998 consumption for the entire facility was 77.2 million kWh with a peak demand of 23,7000 kW.

The Hickam AFB, HI Water Distribution System is supplied to Hickam AFB by the U.S. Navy.  There are six metered connections to the Navy potable water system that supply water to the Hickam AFB potable water distribution system.  Three of the meters are an 18-inch turbine meter with a telescopic register and totalizer, installed in below-grade concrete vaults.  The other three meters are 12-inch Hershey compound meters that have low-, medium-, and high-flow registers also installed in below-grade concrete vaults.  The U.S. Navy is currently servicing these compound meters.  A 12-inch connection to the Board of Water Supply water system that is located near the Honolulu International Airport side of the installation has been valved off from the system and is not currently used.  The distribution system at Hickam AFB includes piping, valves, backflow preventers, meters, and associated appurtenances.  Distribution network main pipelines range in size from 4 to 18 inches in diameter and are constructed of case iron, asbestos cement, ductile iron, and PVC pipe.  Service laterals are typically 1- to 3-inch copper pipe.  There are approximately 463,700 linear feet of piping.  Water usage by the Base averages approximately 6.5 mgd.  Hickam AFB is currently regulated by the State of Hawaii Safe Drinking Water Branch and is classified as a consecutive distribution system coupled to the Navy’s potable water system.

The Hickam AFB Wastewater Collection System is treated at the Fort Kamehameha Sewage Treatment Plant (STP), which is under U.S. Navy jurisdiction and ownership and is located in the western portion of the Base.  Wastewater is collected at Hickam AFB in several wastewater collection systems consisting of approximately 406,455 linear feet of vitrified clay, reinforced concrete, PVC, ACP, VP, and cast-iron piping ranging in size from 4 to 24 inches in diameter.  Wastewater collection piping at Hickam AFB includes both gravity and pressure piping systems.  The wastewater collection system includes 33 sewage pump and lift stations, ranging in size from approximately 100 to 1,000 gpm.  Wastewater flows are estimated to average 2.2 mgd.  Effluent from the Fort Kamehameha STP discharges into Pearl Harbor from an 18-inch outfall under the Navy’s NPDES permit for the STP.

The Bellows Air Force Station, Waimanalo, HI Electric Distribution System is supplied from two separate HECO sources at 4.16/2.7 kV.  The northern portion of the system is approximately 2 miles of overhead primary with 30 customer service transformers representing about 940 kVA of capacity.  The southern portion of the system is approximately 1.2 miles of overhead primary and 0.6 miles of underground primary with 14 customer service transformers representing 320 kVA of capacity.  The 1998 consumption for the entire facility was 2.4 million kWh with a peak demand of 527 kW.

The Bellows Air Force Station, Waimanalo, HI Water Distribution System is supplied to Bellows AFS by the Board of Water Supply distribution system.  The Base potable water distribution system includes two metered connections to Board of Water Supply mains, fire hydrants, valves, and approximately diameter.  The Base water system is currently not regulated by the State of Hawaii Safe Drinking Water Branch and is classified as a single-connection to the Board of Water Supply. 

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.

<DESC>The Government does not presently intend to award a contract but requests the following information for planning purposes.  This is an announcement of a Request for In-formation (RFI) on the Government approach outlined in the Integrated Maintenance Data Sys-tem (IMDS) Master Evolution Plan (MEP), including Appendices A, B, and G.  IMDS was des-ignated as a pilot program on 21 December 2001 by the Office of the Secretary of Defense under the Rapid Improvement Team (RIT) for Information Technology Acquisition Management Transformation.  To support RIT initiatives, the IMDS program previously announced a two-phased acquisition approach.  In Phase 1, the Government is rapidly fielding mission support ap-plications and continuing core legacy system enhancement/modernization/migration.  In Phase 2, the Government will solicit for a contractor/contractor team to provide the end solution for IMDS.  The IMDS MEP outlines a proposed plan for the IMDS program proceeding into Phase 2.  The Government is not requesting questions on the IMDS MEP content at this time and no questions will be addressed.  The Government requests constructive review of the IMDS MEP. Comments are requested to the following: (a)  Successful achievement of a project based on the IMDS MEP.   If it is achievable, to what degree and by what means.  If not achievable, state reason(s) why and provide recommenda-tions on what is needed. Recommendations on alternatives for achieving the MEP goals will be considered. (b)  Understanding of the overall strategy for Phase 2. (c)  Achievability of the schedule (outlined in IMDS MEP Figures 0-1 and 0-2), including the legacy system(s) decommission. (d)  Estimate costs to accomplish strategy as outlined in the IMDS MEP, with any suggested modifications, and a viable schedule. (e) Best approach for data management (documenting the legacy data elements and imple-mentation of an enterprise data warehouse).  Usability of the MEP data management approach in the future conversion to IMDS. (f)	Additional information needed on legacy systems to propose an IMDS solution. (g)  Benefit of the IMDS Functional Baseline Operational Architecture in proposing an IMDS solution. (h)  Recommendations on the length of time needed to prepare an IMDS solution proposal. (i)	Suggestions on how the IMDS program office can assist industry to increase their under-standing of  IMDS. (j)  Modifications/alternatives that would benefit the Government and ensure success, based on industry/commercial experience. (k) Provide information relative to past approaches for conversion/decommissioning of legacy systems and applicable lessons learned. (l)  Recommendations on an approach to integrate data from numerous legacy systems to pre-pare for implementation of a newly developed system or conversion to COTS. (m)  Recommendations on an approach for staging legacy systems for incremental decommis-sioning and migration to the IMDS solution. Comments should be submitted no later than 06 June 2003. There is no solicitation available at this time. This is not a request for proposals.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This is a Request for Information only and does not, by its issuance, restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will not reimburse any costs for any information, documentation, and/or data submitted or prepa-ration costs for submittals in response to this RFI. The IMDS program office requests that interested parties request an electronic copy of the MEP.  Electronic copies will be e-mailed to interested parties.

<SUBJECT>A -- TREATMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES IN PEDIATRIC POPULATION:  CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS
<DESC>SUMMARY: The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is seeking proposals from companies in the form of capability statements for Clinical Trials to provide  
1)	insulin,
2)	equipment needed for the care of children with type 2 diabetes (including glucose meters and strips, syringes, lancets, urine ketone strips, concentrated glucose solution for performing oral glucose tolerance tests, topical anesthetic cream for blood drawing, automated blood pressure devices and cuffs, automated scales),
3)	equipment required to measure the effects of lifestyle change (including mechanically breaked cycle ergometers, heart rate monitors and electronic metronomes for performing PWC, accelerometers, pedometers),
4)	materials to create a “toolbox” to be utilized to enhance the ability of underprivileged children to attain lifestyle changes, particularly increased physical activity (including sneakers, jump ropes, etc.)

STUDY GOAL: The overall goal of this study is to evaluate potential treatment modalities for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, to determine the safest and most efficacious options for treatment. Twelve clinical centers will enroll a total of approximately 750 patients. For medical care, subjects will be seen every 2 months during the first year, and every 3 months during the subsequent years. The total duration of the trial is 5 years. The primary outcome will be related to the achievement and maintenance of glycemic control; numerous important secondary outcomes will also be evaluated, including preservation of beta cell function, side effects and quality of life, markers for vascular complications, and cost effectiveness. 
	Applicants for a Clinical Trial Agreement to support this clinical trial must include a description of the staff with experience and expertise to collaborate in multicenter clinical studies of patients with diabetes. Applicants should provide a detailed description of the materials or equipment to be provided. How the drug or product will be sent to each participating center, as well as packaging, storing and accountability issues must be presented. 

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS: A selection committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations. It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the selection committee through their capability statements. The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages and should address the following selection criteria:
1.	The statement should provide specific details about the product to be supplied, particularly any validation of its use in a pediatric population, and in obese subjects, if relevant.
2.	The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the product in a timely manner for the duration of the study.
3.	The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator. 

DATES: Only written Clinical Trial capability statements received by the NIDDK on or before April 19, 2003 will be considered. Applicants meeting the criteria as set forth in this announcement will be invited, at the Collaborator’s expense, to discuss their plans, capabilities, and research findings pertinent to the study at a meeting of the Steering Committee, date and place to be determined. The Institute may issue an additional notice of Clinical Trial opportunity. This notice is directed toward companies with resources to support collaborations.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND QUESTIONS: Capability statements should be submitted to Rochelle Blaustein, J.D., Director, Technology Transfer and Development, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 12 South Drive, MSC 5632, Bethesda, MD  20892-5632, rochelleb@intra.niddk.nih.gov, Fax:  301-402-7461.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quote (RFQ).  This procurement is being issued as 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. Submit written offers (oral offers will not be accepted), on RFQ FQCES1311305.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541611 applies.  All firms or individuals responding must be actively registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, NO EXCEPTIONS.  To register, you may apply through the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Offerors must also have a commercial and government entity code (CAGE Code).  All responsive business offerors will be considered by the agency.  Award will be made using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the evaluation procedures at FAR 13.106-2 will be used.  A Firm-Fixed Price award will be made to the responsible offeror submitting the quote that provides the Best Value to the government.  Proposal shall be in accordance with the following scope of work:  The Contractor shall provide all services to bring RAFB into compliance with Section 112(r) of the federal Clean Air Act as amended, and applicable state regulations.  All elements of a Risk Management Program shall be developed for RAFB.  The Contractor shall update the existing Risk Management Plan.  This program and plan shall meet all the provisions required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) as specified in 40 CFR 68 Subparts A-G.  Performance of this effort will require a thorough review of each installation’s current risk management program/procedures applicable to each covered process. The EPA requires that a Risk Management Plan be developed for all processes involving regulated substances in excess of threshold levels.  Examples of typical covered processes include:  chlorine used to treat water and/or wastewater (stored in quantities equal to or in excess of 2,500 pounds), and propane used in firefighter training (stored in quantities equal or in excess of 10,000 pounds).  A Risk Management Program update includes a hazard assessment, prevention program, management system, emergency response program, and a Risk Management Plan.  The Contractor shall provide consulting services as specified throughout this Statement of Work (SOW).  All data collection activities, correspondence, and meetings with personnel from each installation will focus on completing the following deliverables: Identification and/or Verification of Processes Covered by Risk Management Program; Hazard Assessment/Modeling; Program Level Determination; Emergency Response Program; and Federal Risk Management Plan. For purposes of cost estimation and technical program development, the scope of this project should assume the following: (a) HazMart/EMIS data and other/better available information on the base chemical/material storage and use will be provided to the contractor in hard copy or electronic format, depending on availability. (b) The propane processes at the fire training area will be covered under the Risk Management Program.  Any additional processes that require compliance with the Risk Management Program will be discussed with the COR and will require a modification to this SOW. (c) Installation will provide the contractor with access to existing procedures, policies, and other documents governing the proper management and handling of hazardous substances. Contractor personnel shall not provide news releases or conduct media interviews concerning the work performed under this SOW.  All media inquiries will be directed to the Contracting Officer (CO) or his/her technical representative (COR).  Contractor personnel shall not contact any regulatory agency without prior approval by the COR. Title III of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 resulted in the addition of Section 112(r), “Prevention of Accidental Releases” to the Clean Air Act.  Section 112(r) specifies requirements for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate a list of extremely hazardous substances which, in the case of accidental release, are known to cause or may reasonably be anticipated to cause death, injury, or serious adverse effects to human health or the environment.  The EPA promulgated the final listing of regulated substances on 31 January 1994 and incorporated it into 40 CFR 68.  The list consists of 77 toxic and 63 flammable substances and includes threshold quantities for each substance.  Section 112(r) also specifies requirements for the EPA to promulgate regulations to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  The EPA’s final rule for accidental release prevention requirements was promulgated on 20 June 1996 and was also incorporated into 40 CFR 68.  The rule requires applicable sources to implement a risk management program.  Applicable sources are stationary sources with processes that involve more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance.  Processes with regulated substances above the threshold quantities are referred to as “covered processes.”  The main elements of a risk management program include:  conducting a hazard assessment, documenting a management system, implementing a prevention program, implementing an emergency response program, and preparing/submitting a Risk Management Plan to the appropriate administrative/regulatory agency. Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental statutes, regulations, rules (including all changes and amendments), and Presidential Executive Orders.  Department of Defense Directives (DoDD), Air Force Instructions (AFI), and other guidance documents referenced below, contain significant information of Air Force policies and procedures, and as such, shall be considered guidance information: Clean Air Act, Section 112(r), “Prevention of Accidental Releases” Applicable State Regulations and Statues, Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 (40 CFR 68), “Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions”, EPA Final Rule, “List of Regulated Substances and Thresholds for Accidental Release Prevention; Requirements for Petitions Under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act as Amended,” 31 January 1994, 59 FR 4478. EPA Proposed Rule, List of Regulated Substances and Thresholds for Accidental Release Prevention; Proposed Amendments,” 15 April 1996, 61 FR 165 98. EPA Final Rule, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs Under Clean Air Act Section 112(r)(7),” 20 June 1996, 61 FR 31668. “Risk Management Plan Data Elements,” U.S. EPA, undated. “RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance,” U.S. EPA, 24 May 1996. “Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration,” U.S. EPA, May 1996. 29 CFR 1910.119, “Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.” The Contractor shall participate in progress meetings and telephone conference calls as required to successfully complete this project.
The Contractor shall be responsible for generating meeting minutes for any meetings held.  The meeting minutes shall document all items discussed and shall include a list of attendees. The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining and monitoring assigned (used by his/her own staff) security badges and vehicle passes, used for the duration of this contract.  All requests for security badges or vehicle passes, will be processed through 12 Contracting Office. All badges and passes will be returned to the base point of contact (POC)- upon expiration of the badge, upon completion of the project, or when possession of the badge is no longer necessary (e.g., upon removal or project completion) of contracted personnel from specific projects).  Photography of any kind must be coordinated through the installation POC.  Develop a risk management plan or update existing plan for applicable processes in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.  Prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP) or update the existing RMP information for each covered process at RAFB. The Contractor shall develop an RMP (same as above) that meets all the criteria and requirements specified in the regulations.  At minimum, the RMP will be a relatively brief document consisting of an executive summary, description of processes covered, a data elements checklist consisting of Yes/No responses, numerical data (such as the population count vulnerable to the worst-case release), and various supporting attachments. Because the Risk Management Plan and attachments will become part of the base’s public record upon submittal to the agencies, it is the public’s “window” into how each installation manages chemical risks.  Therefore, the Contractor must address the Risk Management Plan’s importance to the base’s public image and should use adequate care and review by the COR and base POCs during development of this document. The first part of the task involves developing or revising a draft Risk Management Plan for Air Force review and comment.  The Contractor shall compile and use the data gathered and developed as part of the earlier tasks to complete the data elements checklist.  Any additional data collection during this task should be limited to telephone calls and clarifications.  All data should be coordinated through the local environmental protection committee (EPC).  The Contractor shall perform the second portion of this task toward the end of the period of performance for this project.  Using the final hazard assessment results and comments from the Air Force on the draft Risk Management Plan, the Contractor should generate a document suitable for regulatory submittal.  While major scenario or modeling changes are not anticipated during the period of performance, future U.S. EPA guidance and/or industry consensus may allow changes in some of the model inputs or assumptions.  Based on initial Air Force comments, agency input, and any changes in U.S. EPA guidance or regulations, the Contractor will prepare a final plan for final Air Force review.  The final Risk Management Plan will be provided in both hard copy and electronic format along with detailed instructions for Air Force submittal to the regulators.  Contractor shall assist in all submittals.  The Contractor shall verify that the identified processes are the only covered processes at each installation.  This will involve a review of available hazardous material inventories, submittals for Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) compliance, and interviews with personnel.  If the Contractor identifies additional processes that trigger the Risk Management Program requirements, the scope and associated costs for this effort will be discussed immediately with the COR.  The Contractor shall then use the Lookup Tables developed by the U.S. EPA to establish the worst-case scenario (WCS) impact zone for the Risk Management Program-covered process.  The objective of this task will be to estimate distances to endpoints and the population within the impact zones. The Contractor will also consult with base POC and other appropriate personnel regarding the selection of Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) for the covered process (proposed fire training propane tank).  Similar to the WCS described above, the U.S. EPA’s Lookup Tables will be used to estimate the impacts of ARS releases.  Such releases are typically more reasonable and likely to occur than the WCS and must be included in the Risk Management Program. Once the Contractor has estimated the accident impacts and public receptors, it will be possible to determine whether processes quality for Program 1, 2, or 3.  Under the Risk Management Program rule, different processes may qualify for different program levels.  The appropriate level for each process depends on proximity to public receptors, whether the process is subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and other factors.  A process in program 1 has significantly fewer requirements than a process in program 2 or 3.  A process in program 2 will be subject to entirely different prevention program criteria than a process in program 3.  In this task, the Contractor shall develop a Prevention Program for the propane and chlorine storage and handling process at each installation, assuming that each qualifies for Program 2.  This prevention program will need to include the following elements: Safety Information, Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation.  Note:  Risk Management Program-covered propane processes with no public receptors in the worst-case impact zone will qualify for a Program 1.  No prevention program will be needed for these processes. The Contractor shall review existing emergency planning and response documentation associated with the Risk Management Plan-covered process.  Data collection activities will include discussions with the Disaster Preparedness Office, the Base Fire Department, the Base Bioenvironmental Engineer, and other responsible organizations; a review of existing material handling and emergency response procedures; and reviews of process-specific equipment and resources available for use during an emergency.  Based on these activities, the Contractor will develop a technical memorandum that defines recommendations for achieving compliance with the Risk Management Program emergency response requirements.  The memorandum will be submitted with supporting information appended. During this task, installation personnel will provide the Contractor with timely access to all appropriate personnel and  information.  However, the Contractor is responsible for identifying and obtaining the information necessary to complete this task. The Contractor shall present, discuss, and explain the approved Risk Management Program to appropriate installation personnel.  This meeting shall include explaining the regulatory requirements (including record keeping), training the major components of a risk management program.  Installation personnel shall include, but not be limited to, Environmental Office, Safety Office, Public Affairs Office, Legal Office, Fire Department, and Facilities Maintenance.  The meeting should assist personnel from each discipline to define their roles and responsibilities in regard to this rule. The Contractor shall collect, prepare, publish, and distribute the data in the quantities specified by POC.  The Contractor shall designate a focal point who shall integrate the total data management effort and manage changes, additions, or deletions of data items.  In addition, the Contractor shall identify items to be added or deleted.  Deliverables shall be in accordance with the CDRLs applicable to this DO. Upon request, installation personnel will supply the Contractor with copies (either hard copy or electronic files) of existing management plans, sampling plans, operating records and analytical results, and other documents that are essential to completing the air emissions inventory.  The Contractor shall reproduce these documents and return the originals to the government within 72 hours of issue.  Installation personnel will ensure that all base personnel who are essential to this effort (i.e., source operators) are available to provide necessary information.

This notice constitutes a BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Ray Meilunas  (301) 342-8064

I. INTRODUCTION.  The NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVAIR) and the Polymers/Composites Branch of the Aerospace Materials Division under the Air Vehicle Department (AIR-4.3) is soliciting proposals for research and development (R&D) concepts in the area of polymers and composite materials and structures to support current and future Naval Aviation needs. Concepts proposed may represent novel dedicated technologies and/or dual use of new emerging commercial technology. 

II. BACKGROUND.  
The mission of the Polymers & Composites Branch of the NAVAIR Aerospace Materials Division is to identify and pursue the most promising technologies within a broad spectrum of the science and engineering research communities and to develop, evaluate, and transition those technologies into NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS to impart new military capabilities. To this end, NAVAIR is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development in a variety of enabling technical areas as described below. Proposals may be either basic or applied research. Proposals that are not within the topical areas described below may be considered out of scope and not evaluated. Proposals that are not research, but rather integration of technologies or systems development will also be considered. Multiple awards are anticipated. The amount of resources made available to this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds. While there is no specific requirement for cost and duration of the proposed effort, it is recommended that proposer include a Phase I of no more than 18 months in length that addresses the most critical issues on the path to success. This BAA constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort. No Proposer Information Pamphlet or other additional information will be published, nor will a formal request for proposal, or other solicitation, regarding this research and development be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded.

III. SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST.   
New Materials, Materials Concepts, Materials Processing applied to polymers and composites. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: development and application of new and improved resins, structural reinforcing fibers, core and foam materials, adhesives, and sealants/coatings for naval aviation composite applications; new and/or lower cost manufacturing processes for structural composites (including tooling); process modeling; engineered materials for low-observable applications; high temperature resins/adhesives; structural and non-structural adhesives, Appliqué and paint replacement film materials, environmentally compliant surface preparations for bonding,  non-chromated and organic corrosion inhibitors for sealants and/or adhesives, novel approaches to toughened resins for prepregs and adhesives; Nanomaterials and structural nanocomposites, including carbon nanotubes; composite property/life prediction and related technologies; fracture phenomena of polymers & composites; galvanic corrosion ; Optical materials and coatings  for aircraft transparencies and their repair; self-healing, -sensing and -adapting polymers and composites; smart and adaptive (morphing) materials and structures; and structural and multifunctional (structure + function) materials; repair technologies;  biomaterials and biomimetic materials. Ideas outside of the advertised focused areas will be considered in scope provided they have the potential for radical improvement to national security and are within the interest of the office.

IV. CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE.  NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or non-procurement agreements (e.g. Grants, Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions).  Other Transactions will be entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371, and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects.  Information concerning Other Transactions can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/other_trans.html and http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/research, or by contacting Vanessa Seymour at (301) 757-2619 or by e-mail at seymourva@navair.navy.mil.  Final decision on acquisition type (contract/agreement) will be made by the government.

NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project.  Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal).  In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act.

VI. EVALUATION CRITERIA. The government will evaluate proposals responsive to any or all of the areas of interest discussed herein. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since each is a unique technology with no common work statement.  The primary evaluation criteria are: 

A.	Scientific and technical merits of the proposed research to include, (1) the degree to which proposed research and development objectives support the targeted technical topic and (2) validity of the technical basis for the approach offered; and

B.	The offeror’s capabilities to include (1) related experience, (2) past performance on similar efforts, (3) research investigators/personnel, (4) facilities, (5) techniques or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives (all equally valued); and

C.	The socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the commitment to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities with small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and HBCU/MIs. If the contracting officer requests a full cost proposal, and the total exceeds $500,000, large businesses will be required to include a Small Business Subcontracting Plan with its proposal package in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.

D.	The realism and reasonableness of cost, including any proposed cost sharing. 

III. AWARDS.  NAVAIR is planning to make awards within the overall Program Objectives stated above (See Para. II). All awards will be based on merit competition and availability of funding. The Government reserves the right to select all, some or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Any awards are subject to the availability of appropriations.  There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror before award of a contract/agreement.
