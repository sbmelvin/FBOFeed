<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302 with the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT for the professional service of serving as co-leader of a national symposium on community-based outreach (CBO).  The period of performance shall not exceed two (2) years.
 
Specifically, the University of Utah, in conjunction with the New York Academy of Medicine, shall provide co-leadership of all phases of the planning, implementation and reporting of the symposium.  The University of Utah shall be responsible for the development of the program for the symposium.  The University of Utah shall be responsible for the presentation of the symposium and the publication of the proceedings.

For this procurement NLM seeks a vendor who is a Regional Medical Library (RML) with the National Network of Libraries of Medicine as defined by NLM’s National Network Office, and has extensive outreach experience supporting the programmatic goals and policies of the NLM. Major goals of the symposium are to provide NLM with an assessment of its outreach activities as they relate specifically to NLM's health disparities plan, and to provide guidance to NLM in defining the outreach activities that will be required of the RMLs when these contracts are re-competed in approximately one year's time. (All 8 of the existing RMLs are expected to participate in the symposium.). The RML selected must have relevant experience and a leadership position in developing and encouraging inter-regional collaborations among the NNLM RMLs.  Additionally, the RML must have a strong interest and current activities in Community-Based Outreach, with a special emphasis on outreach to Native American communities--since the CBO Symposium will have a significant sub theme on Native American outreach. Also, since it has been determined that the other co-sponsor of the CBO Symposium will be the RML located in New York City, the RML sought for the work in this solicitation must be an RML serving a predominately rural, small town region in order to balance the big city, urban emphasis in New York City. After reviewing all RMLs, and noting the endorsement of the University of Utah RML by two of the other remaining 6 RMLs (UCLA and the Houston Academy of Medicine) NLM staff determined that the Mid-Continental RML located in Utah is the only RML meeting all required criteria for this work. 

This service will be procured under FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions.)  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible and responsive sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  Responses should demonstrate the firm’s ability to meet the government’s requirements.  Responses are required within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 03-244/NSD shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.

<ARCHDATE>12222003
<CONTACT>Mr. Jerry Miller,937-656-6536
<DESC>NA LAIRCM Next Generation MWS Upgrade The Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM)  Program is in the process of developing the acquisition  strategy for the Next Generation Missile Warning Subsystem  (NexGen MWS) System Development and Demonstration  acquisition phase.   The NexGen MWS program is a  combined effort between the  U.S. Special Operations Command Directional Infrared  Countermeasures (DIRCM) Joint Program  Office and the U.S. Air Force Large Aircraft Infrared  Countermeasures (LAIRCM) Program Office (ASC/GRI).  ASC/GRI  is the lead contracting organization for the project. The purpose of the DIRCM program is to protect special  operations aircraft from infrared (IR) surface-to-air  missiles (SAM) and air-to-air missiles (AAM).  The DIRCM program is presently equipping  MC-130E/H,  AC-130H/U, MH-53 aircraft with Northrop Grumman’s AN/AAQ-24  (V)  Infrared Countermeasures Set.  Future plans include  equipping the CV-22 aircraft.  Key subsystems of the DIRCM  system include missile warning, transmitter assemblies with  and without lasers, and  processors.  The missile warning subsystem uses multiple  sensors to provide spatial coverage around the aircraft.   The  countermeasures subsystem uses transmitter assemblies to  direct infrared lamp or laser energy onto the missile  seeker and jam  its guidance subsystem, driving the missile off target.   The DIRCM program plan includes a Pre-planned Product  Improvement (P3I) to upgrade the missile warning subsystem. The purpose of the LAIRCM program is to protect Air  Mobility Command’s (AMC) large transport and tanker  aircraft from IR SAMs.  To meet AMC’s immediate needs,  Phase I of the program equips C-17 and C-130 aircraft with  the Northrop Grumman AN/AAQ-24  Infrared Countermeasures Set, an upgraded version of  the DIRCM system.  The LAIRCM program uses small laser  transmitter assemblies.  The ultraviolet missile warning  subsystem, AN/AAR-54, is common to both LAIRCM and DIRCM.   Phase II of the LAIRCM program will incorporate technology  improvements, through evolutionary acquisition spiral  developments, to increase the affordability and  effectiveness of the system for AMC.  One of the Phase II  improvements is the Next Generation (NexGen) Missile  Warning Subsystem (MWS).  Phase I and Phase  II requirements are defined in the multi-command LAIRCM ORD  314-92, validated 3 Aug 98. The NexGen MWS project provides a missile warning upgrade  for both the DIRCM and LAIRCM programs.  The acquisition  strategy being considered is to conduct a System  Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase with up to two  contractors.  At the completion of SDD, the program would  conduct a full and open competition to select a single  contractor for the Production and Deployment Phase. For more information on LAIRCMNGMWS--LAIRCM Next Generation Missile Warning Subsystem please refer to http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixslibr/LAIRCMNGMWS/LAIRCMNGMWS.asp

<DESC>The USNS Zeus (T-ARC-7) has an obsolete auxiliary boilers' combustion control system causing maintenance and operational difficulties.  Military Sealift Command (MSC) has decided to replace the existing ACC boiler control system with a modern PLC type (boiler control) combustion control system.  MSC is requesting quotes from qualified small businesses that can design, procure and install an approved ABS/USCG commercial off the shelf packaged (COTS) PLC automatic combustion/boiler control system, using state of the art technology, interfaced to control the auxiliary boilers on the ZEUS.  The COTS boiler control system shall be in accordance with all ABS, USCG and MSC guidelines.  The new system shall be reliable, durable, and applicable for future improvements and have service accessibility.  The hardware and software for the boiler control system design shall be factory tested by the contractor before installation and be ABS/USCG approved.  The contractor will also test the boiler control system for proper operation after installation.  It is anticipated that this procurement will be a 100% small business set-aside.  The solicitation will be issued on or around 18 September and will be made available on the MSC website, www.msc.navy.mil.  Questions should be directed to Mr. Mike Vicory by phone (202-685-5947) or email (michael.vicory@navy.mil).

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 12 and Part 13 Commercial and Simplified procedures, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Sunset Laboratories to procure: (A) one (1) Elemental and Organic Carbon (EC/OC) Analyzer with one (1) replacement Transmission Oven Unit and two (2) Parallel Plate Carbon Filter VOC Denuders and (B)  one (1) Field Grade Elemental and Organic Carbon (EC/OC) Aerosol Analyzer. For Item (A) EPA desires to have one analyzer unit that can perform both Thermo-Optical Transmittance and Thermo-Optical Reflectance analysis procedures in a  laboratory setting.  The use of a single analyzer is required to allow for analysis on the same sample providing a direct comparison of the results.  This is essential for data quality.   For Item (B), EPA is conducting a field study on Particulate Mass emissions from vehicles.  EPA needs an analyzer unit that combines both the collection and analytical functions in one operation in a non-laboratory setting.  This unit will allow EPA to collect sufficient accurate in-use mobile exhaust particulate matter data from the field study to support rule-making.  The applicable NAICS code is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond to the office identified above. Documentation must be received by September 26, 2003 in order to be considered by the EPA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties should submit a written response to David Plagge by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail plagge.david@epa.gov to receive consideration for this contract.

<DESC>NAICS code 541199.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13 “Simplified Acquisition Procedures” (48 CFR Part 13), the United States Department of Commerce is providing widespread notice of this acquisition opportunity and is requesting proposals to provide technical assistance to the Government of Egypt (GOE) to supplement training provided to Egyptian diplomats at the Institute of Diplomatic Studies (IDS) in Cairo, Egypt.  The successful offeror will work with United States Department of Commerce Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP), IDS and the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to sharpen international commercial negotiation skills of diplomatic attaches.

In coordination with the IDS, a CLDP Advisor with expertise in negotiation technique and strategy will travel to Cairo, Egypt, for two weeks to prepare for and train IDS attaches in the art of negotiations, including the research and preparation involved before actual face-to-face negotiations.  The goals of this program are to train attaches in the necessary skills to research a negotiation topic, anticipate relevant issues, prepare alternative positions, and engage in one-on-one commercial negotiations.  This program will include both lectures and negotiation simulations.  
This Contract is for up to fifteen (15) days of work. No medical benefits (other than emergency medical and evacuation insurance), leave or other fringe benefits will be provided.  

Evaluation Criteria. The offerors should have the following technical capabilities: 

1.Significant experience (at least 10 years) participating in commercial negotiation and training for public and private sector representatives; and

2.Significant experience (at least 10 years) working in emerging markets or developing countries.

Response Requirements.  Interested offerors are requested to submit a brief capability statement (not to exceed five (5) pages) which comprehensively addresses each criterion set forth above. Cost and technical proposals are not required and will not be considered at this time. The Government will review and evaluate timely received capability statements and those offerors who meet the Evaluation Criteria will be deemed “qualified”. The Government will then furnish each qualified offeror with a draft copy of the Statement of Work, source selection criteria and proposal instructions. The Government may enter into discussions with qualified offeror after receipt of capability statements and after receipt of proposals. If the Contracting Officer determines that such discussions are necessary, the Government will notify qualified offeror of the date/time for such discussions. For the sake of clarity, the Government may communicate with qualified offeror at any point during evaluation of the capability statements and proposal evaluation process. The Government also reserves the right to award without discussions at the Contracting Officer’s discretion.   

Contract Type and Period of Performance. The Government anticipates issuing a Purchase Order for a firm-fixed price that will require the contractor to complete the required work within 30days of Purchase Order award. 

Additional Information. Compliance with protocol between the governments of the Country and the United States of America in connection with performance of the Contract will be required.  Qualified offerors will be briefed on the protocols and security requirements. The protocols and security requirements are not available for public dissemination.  Qualified offerors who have been provided with the protocol and security information will be forbidden from disclosing the terms, content and procedures of the protocol and security. Furthermore, while in the County, the selected contractor will be representing the Commercial Law Development Program, the U.S. Department of Commerce and, by extension, the United States Government. The contractor will therefore be required to adhere to all applicable ethics codes in effect in their respective jurisdictions and professions and contractors also must adhere to applicable federal conflict of interest statutes and standards of conduct.

Response Requirements.  Interested offerors must submit two (2) copies of capability statements on or before 09/22/03.  The capability statements must specifically and comprehensively address the Evaluation Criteria and be submitted in writing. The address to which Capability Statements must be addressed and sent is: Cherita Toulson, Contract Specialist, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 6521, 1401 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THE QUESTIONS RECEIVED FOR DEA-03-AA-0034(mjs) AND THEIR ANSWERS APPEAR BELOW:

1. Has the government procured (or planning to procure under a separate  process) the CISCO CATALYST SWITCHES outside the scope of this specific  synopsis?

No - the procurement of the switches is part of this contract.

 2. Has the government procured (or planning to procure under a separate process) the major cabling equipment (equipment racks, patch panels, patch cables, etc.) outside the scope of this specific synopsis?

No - the procurement of the any and all material necessary to complete the project is part of this process.

3. Has a network design, complete with configurations, already been approved? (Agency-wide standards?)

No 

 4. Has it been determined what size CISCO switches are required based on current versus future usage?

This information is detailed in the synopsis by the number of ports active and required on the patch panel.  I left it up to the contractor to determine the number of switches they need to provide to satisfy the port requirement.  For example, if I needed 96 active ports, the contractor can suggest 2 - 48 port switches or 4 - 24 port switches.  Contractor A may be able to get the 24 port switches at a lower cost than the 48 port switch that contractor B yet satisfy the same requirement.

5.	Is there fiber connecting the closets?

Yes – this information is also detailed in the synopsis by how the closets are connected.

6.	Do they need/want routing capabilities?

No. 

7.  It seems that both networks (referred to as networks 1 and 2) exist in both
Closet 1 and Closet 2.  They claim they have 168 ports terminated in Closet 1, 
With Network 1 using 83 ports, and Network 2 using 48 ports.  This only adds up
to 131 ports.  Does this mean they are using 131 ports in the switches, but have 168 terminated in the patch panel? 

Yes

7.	Do they want Network 1 and 2 to be in separate chassis, or can we break up the two networks with VLANS?

The two networks are separate…..no VLANs.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide answers to the following questions we have received:  Question 1:  Can you elaborate on "Issue Management Functionality" & "Document Functionality"?  These terms mean different things to different people.  I want to make sure we understand what specific functionality DOE needs.  Answer 1:  Issue Management Functionality - the COTS product should have the capability to track & categorize project issues and resolutions.  It should also allow you to prioritize the issues for the project.  Document Management Functionality - the product should be able to act as a repository for documents listed under separate folders (by project) using the web interface.  Version control of documents should be easy to track.  Question 2:  Capture - Can ED provide more detail to the requirement for document checkin? For example, is there any existing legacy data planned for checkin (e.g. hardcopy paper, non MS office "e" files) and/or is the checkin particularly focused on new MS Office/Project data types. Corresponding with the capture requirement, can ED provide a rough estimate of the data volume anticipated across the 150 end-user licenses planned for deployment.  Answer 2:  There is no need to do any document capturing.  All documents are in electronic format as stated in the solicitation.  We do not anticipate more than approximately 500 documents.  Question 3:  Has there been any preliminary analysis work performed by the ED regarding the index fields necessary to support control of the data planned for storage in the project archive?  Answer 3:  Yes, all documents should be stored by project name.  Question 4:  Is the ED anticipating the vendor would bid the implementation services surrounding the capture requirement into its bid?  Answer 4:  We are not sure how to anwer this question.  Can you clarify further what you are asking?  Question 5:  Security - Does the ED anticipate that any advanced security features will be provided with the system?  Answer 5:  No, ID and password protection.  Question 6:  Are they any particular security or sensitive data requirements the ED would expect the system to include for the project archive?  For example: Is it necessary to virtually separate the project archive data into their respective project categories and limit access to those personnel assigned or authorized to access the project data or will all 150 end users have access to the same data.  Answer 6:  Users should only have  access(authorization) to the documents within the project they are working on.  Question 7:  Are there any specific data types or sets of information (e.g. cost) which may have unique security profiles.  Answer 7:  No.  Question 8:  If the former approach is selected, has the ED already identified the primary project areas it would like to secure separate from other project areas.  Answer 8:  No.  Question 9:  Collaboration - Are there processing requirements associated with the collaboration component of the  solicitation?  For example, when a project is changed for some reason (schedule change, resource availability modifications, etc.) is there an approval process prior to incorporating this change?  Answer 9:  No.  Question 10:  If there is an associated review process associated with related project documents used (visio, MS office and Adobe are mentioned in the Solicitation), are these documents redlined, commented, etc. during the process?  Answer 10:  Yes.  Question 11:  How is change communicated within the project workspace? Is there a formal change request process? Answer 11:  No.  Question 12:  Access - Is tracking of access to the files and actions resulting from access (e.g., read, edit, delete) required? Answer 12:  No.
Question 13:  Will a firewall separate the users from the hosted system?  Answer 13:  No.  Question 14:  If so, what are the security requirements for the firewall? Answer 14:  N/A.
Question 15:  What exactly do you mean by "cross project management functionality"  Answer 15:  The ability to manage more than one project simultaneously, and the ability to exchange files or information between two or more projects.  For example, Project A might be underway, but then a relationship with Project E might be discovered: information exchanges or joint scheduling between A and E might be added to both projects in flight.
Question 16:  Can you explain the scope of the file compatibility.  Answer 16:  The ability to open and read files from other cited applications.  The ability to create new content and export it directly to other applications in a file format readable by that other application.

When this requirement has been appropriately modified, it will again be posted to the FEDBIZOPPS site (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/) and NAVAIR home page for solicitations web site (http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/).

WRITTEN EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FOR CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE FOR A NEW US COURTHOUSE, FT. PIERCE, FLORIDA  

WRITTEN EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FOR CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW U. S. COURTHOUSE-FT. PIERCE, FLORIDA-GS-04P-03-EXC-0033. The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in public construction and is presently soliciting written expressions of interest and assurance of bonding capacity letters from qualified general contractors (GC) desiring to compete in the procurement process for the subject construction project. GSA intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract, utilizing successive target prices throughout the source selection process, to obtain the GC that offers the best overall value to the Government. The selected GC must demonstrate a commitment to construction excellence, proposing and maintaining a viable team organization and by adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project. The Government will utilize the Source Selection process in accordance with FAR Part 15.1, Best Value Continuum-FAR 15.101, and the Tradeoff process FAR 15.101-1 to select the GC that offers the best overall value. The site selected by the Government for the new United States Courthouse will be in the Central Business District of Ft. Pierce, Florida. The facility will include approximately 10,994 square meters (118,334 gross square feet) including 34 secure (inside) parking spaces and 73 on-grade parking spaces. The facility will be occupied by the Federal District Court,  Magistrate Court, Bankruptcy Court, District Clerk, Probation, Pretrial Services, Federal Defender, U.S. Attorneys Office, U.S. Marshals Service and the GSA.  The estimated total construction cost for the project is estimated to range between $25,000,000 and $26,500,000 with occupancy planned for 4th quarter of FY 2007. This procurement is advertised on an unrestricted basis with an approximate construction time of 545 calendar days. The North American Industry Classification System Code (s) (NAICS) for this procurement is 233220. The project will be in Metric Units of Measure. Utilizing FAR Part 15 and formal Source Selection procedures the GC will be competitively chosen. The Trade-Off process at FAR Part 15.101 allows award to other than the lowest priced proposal therefore, participants are urged to submit all proposals on their best terms possible as it is the Governments intent to make award without discussion in accordance with FAR 15.306 (3), Qualified offerors electing to participate in the name of newly formed partnerships, corporations, joint ventures and/or any other business entity or arrangement will be required to provide the government with legal proof of union upon submission. Under this procedure all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price (15. 101- a (2), thereby magnifying the importance of each offeror’s past and present stated ability to perform at a very high rate of technical competence and to submit all offers on the best terms possible. The procurement process is structured in 4 Stages as follows: STAGE I- In order to become eligible to compete for the award of this project qualified GCs must, within 30 days of the publication of this notice or no later than Close Of Business (COB) August 18, 2003, submit a one page letter of interest (include an address and point of contact that you wish the subsequent RFP package to be mailed) along with a statement letter from a bonding corporate surety, on their (the surety’s) letterhead, certifying their ability to obtain bonding capacity commensurate with the Estimated Construction Cost of at least $26,500,000 (Ceiling Price). Corporate sureties offered must appear on the list contained in the Department of Treasury Circular 570 “Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Reinsuring Companies or Acceptability of Individual Sureties” in accordance with FAR 28.202 and 203 (http://www.fms.treas.gov/c570/index.html). These two letters (letter of interest and bonding) must be submitted to the attention of Mr. R. Butler, Sr. Contracting Officer, General Services Administration, Property Development Division, 25th Floor, 401 West Peachtree Street, N.W-Atlanta, Georgia 30308–again, no later than COB August 18, 2003. In order to facilitate the milestones set for the project and the sequence of events relative to convening the formal Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) and other activities, offerors failing to submit the required Stage I data as required and in the timeframe stated will be ineligible to compete for this procurement. Late and/or incomplete submissions will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.214-7 and may render the offeror ineligible for further participation. Electronic submissions (faxes, e-mails, etc.) are not allowed during any stage of this process. STAGE-II-upon notification from GSA via Request for Proposal (RFP), offerors responding accordingly to Stage I will be required to submit, under separate cover, a target price (Cost and Profit separated) (IMPORTANT NOTE: In order to assist in maintaining the ceiling price and related budgets, Profit Percentages offered in Stage II must remain constant throughout the process and will not be subject to change throughout the various pricing stages for those selected. The amount of profit may change due to cost fluctuations but not the proposed percentage),  based on approximately 20%-35% completed concept documents (provided in the RFP) and technical evaluation factor data relative to this project as follows: (1) Past Experience (2) Past Performance , (3) Key Personnel Data  and (4) Project Management Plan-Technical Approach-Accounting System-Management of Extended Overhead Cost . Details and expanded versions relative to these factors will be contained in the subsequent RFP package. STAGE III-Following the receipt and scoring of the Stage II data and the evaluation/analysis of the price proposal, a shortlist of not more than three offerors will be selected and provided an agenda to compete in an evaluated  Interactive Project Participation Stage whereby they will be required to independently participate in a (5) Value Engineering Workshop(s) for at least 3 days with a maximum of three (3) attendees from each firm eligible to participate and to submit (6) Cost Saving Ideas and Concepts ,complete a (7) Constructability Review(s) and at least one (8) Independent Estimate during design development . The participants will be paid a pre-determined moderate stipend for these services. Upon completion and scoring of this stage the participants will again be asked to submit a target price (cost and profit) (same profit percentage as Stage 1) at approximately 50%-65% design completion along with a subcontracting plan (large businesses only) relative to the proposed price. The SSEB will then combine the target price along with the previous technical scores from each previous stage to select the participant that offers the best overall value to the Government by establishing a firm target price and a commitment to not exceeding the ceiling price of $26,500,000. Stage IV-(Award-CM Services) during this stage the selected GC will work in equanimity with the A-E of record, via a written contractual agreement, not to exceed the pre-determined amount (amount included in RFP) to be paid following contract award, to finalize the design to 100% completion within the committed ceiling price. Upon design completion the Government will negotiate with the selected contractor to establish a Firm Fixed Priced contract noting that the submitted profit percentage remained unchanged. Should negotiations between the final selected GC and the Government reach an impasse the Government, in accordance with FAR 15.405 (d), will refer the matter to a level above the Contracting Officer and request permission to undertake negotiations with the next highest ranked previously short-listed offeror. Award will be based on availability of funds in accordance with FAR 52.232-14. Prior to the Interactive Participation Stage III and submission of price proposals a Pre-Proposal Conference and a Socio-Economic Program Meeting (networking session) will be scheduled with offerors to entertain inquiries concerning the scope of work and related issues. The networking session allows for the marketing and exchange of information with small businesses with potential prime contractors to facilitate marketing opportunities, business ventures and employment opportunities. Prior to award of this contract to a large business a subcontracting plan must be negotiated in accordance with FAR Part 19 which demonstrates a proactive effort to achieve the following minimum small business goals for all subcontracted work: Total Small Businesses (40%), Small Disadvantaged Businesses (8%), Small Women-Owned Businesses (5%), Service-Disabled Veteran (3%) and HubZone (2.5%). All submittals must clearly indicate the solicitation number (GS-04P-03-EXC-0033) on the face of the envelope.  Late submittals will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.215-10.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Biological Resources Division, Great Lakes Science Center, has a requirement to make a non- competitive award via written request for quotation No. 03ER16-No Solicitation number for a Contract with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission (GLFC) to provide genetics research support to the Great Lakes Science Center for one year, with the option of one follow on year. The U.S. Geological Survey anticipates awarding this to the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. The proposed Contractor has a long history of supporting research projects on the genetics of the Great Lakes Fish species and has distinguished genetics on staff. The Commission has established an international reputation for genetics research, and has demonstrated an excellent working relationship with important Great Lakes agencies. The unique knowledge of key Great Lakes species at the Commission has been acquired from years of careful research and permits it to completely present research results and serve experts in this field. In addition, the Commission has worked cooperatively at the center and is intimately involved in all of its ongoing genetics research projects. These projects would come to a quick halt at this time without the Commission's continued participation. It is vitally important to the center's genetics program that the Commission be retained to continue the research project on which they have collaborated.  THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The anticipated award date is 09/18/2003.  NAICS is 813312 and SIC is 9999.  Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Determination to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses to this notice must be submitted via e-mail to: abenton@usgs.gov by 09/15/2003.  No additional synopsis will be published.

<DESC>Description: The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (TACOM-ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 is interested in acquiring information about commercial off-the shelf, non-developmental (NDI) accessory shotguns which can meet the Army’s needs with only minor modifications; or militarized 12 Gage Shotguns that can function in both stand-alone and accessory capacities.  The accessory shotgun shall weigh less than any current stand-alone shotgun while maintaining the capability to fire lethal, non-lethal, and breaching ammunition.  This shall be done without degrading accuracy, reliability, and durability of the weapon system (the accessory shotgun and the host weapon) from the baseline.  The baseline is defined as the stand-alone version of the shotgun and the host weapon (M4/M16 series of weapons and the future combat rifle) without the accessory shotgun attached.  The Accessory Shotgun shall fire 2 3/4” and 3” ammunition.  Both the stand-alone and accessory versions of the Accessory Shotgun shall have detachable magazines.  The accessory version of the Accessory Shotgun shall attach to the M4/M16 series of weapons and the future combat rifle (FCR). Information about existing items or items currently in development is desired.    It is requested, that interested parties submit a description of their item along with other available information (sketches, drawings, specifications, brochures, samples, and/or test results) to:  U.S. Army ARDEC, ATTN: AMSTA-AQ-APD, Stephanie Pascale, Contract Specialist, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey 07806-5000  Email Address - smegee@pica.army.mil.

<CONTACT>Sonya Rappoport, Contract Specialist  973 724-2775
<DESC>The U. S. Army is seeking sources for a conceptual engineering design and process development of the Munitions Cryofracture System portion of a  Plasma/Cryofracture Demilitarization System (PCDS) for the demilitarization of  military ordnance.  The required effort will provide a prototype  Plasma/Cryofracture Demilitarization System (PCDS) utilizing cryofracture and  plasma arc thermal treatment technology for the complete demilitarization of a  variety of conventional ammunition components including high explosive- containing submunitions downloaded from Cluster Bomb Units (CBUs) and  105MM/155MM artillery rounds.  The cryofracture process involves the  embrittlement of munitions by freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by the  fracture of the embrittled munitions by a hydraulic press to fully expose any  embedded energetic material, allowing it to be burned.  This technology was  developed for the demilitarization of small to medium sized, explosive-loaded  munitions such as hand grenades, mines, and the sub-munitions found in ICM and  CBU projectiles that are traditionally difficult to disassemble, have little  recovery value, and have presented problems, such as undesired detonation, when  processed in conventional APE-1236 demil incinerators.  The cryofracture  process also enables valuable materials, or materials that must be disposed of  by alternate means, to be separated from munitions items prior to thermal  processing of energetic and waste components. Interested sources should send  their qualifications to the POC.

<SUBJECT>Installation and Configuration of Software Application (Sharepoint)
<DESC>Sharepoint is a complex application with many possible configurations. DOE is seeking assistance from a strong vendor with experience in integration and configuration of Sharepoint to serve as web portal for an intranet. The purpose of this work is to install and configure Sharepoint for basic features in less than ninety (90) days. The difficulties to be overcome include configuration of Sharepoint 2001 for use on Windows 2000 running on a network without Active Directory. Sharepoint 2003 and Windows 2003 are not candidates for this work due to company policies regulating network servers. This precludes the use of simple configurations and wizards. Experience with manual configuration and knowledge of configuration values is critical to achieve an integrated and functioning system in the limited time available. Vendor will not be able to modify server or network architecture, but must provide a solution working within DOE Oakland policies. The network operates under strict guidance to create a secured network. This is not a classified network, but a very secure network. Vendor may need to adjust the proposed solution to satisfy both security policies and operational procedures. The Sharepoint solution will be implemented on four (4) Compaq dual Pentium servers. This is the planned architecture: LSO2K-SPS SP application server 1 GB RAM LSO2K-SQL SQL Server shared with 5 other applications 1 GB RAM   80 GB storage LSO2K-FILE  File server shared with other applications  512 MB RAM  80 GB storage LSO2K-INWEB IIS 5 web server for intranet  1 GB RAM

<SUBJECT>A--TEAMING OPPORTUNITY NO. 6 FOR THE MISSION AND SCIENCE MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY - 2004 (MSMT-2004) NASA RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT (NRA)
<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners to develop proposals for the Mission and Science Measurement Technology - 2004 (MSMT-2004) NASA Research Announcement (NRA) Synopsis: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has released a draft NASA Research Announcement (NRA) entitled, "Mission and Science Measurement Technology - 2004" (see http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_r/open.cfm). The final NRA is due to be released on approximately August 4, 2003. The MSMT theme seeks proposals for exploratory research and technology development in the Enabling Concepts and Technologies Program (ECT), which defines new system concepts and develops new technologies to enable scientific measurements in support of the Aerospace Technology Enterprise mission.  The ECT program explores revolutionary aerospace systems, and performs fundamental research and development of high-payoff technologies.  Program objectives are to identify, develop, and transfer breakthrough technologies that have broad potential across many types of systems to provide increased scientific return at lower cost, and to enable missions and capabilities beyond current horizons.  The ECT program is on front end of the enabling technology pipeline that supplies the focused technology development programs of the NASA Enterprises.   This NRA solicits technologies in three major areas: 1) Advanced Measurement and Detection Technology; 2) Large Aperture Technology; and 3) Low Power Microelectronics Technology  (These three technology areas can be viewed in greater detail via the NRA cite noted above.) The ECT program primarily focuses on early stage technologies at Technology Readiness Levels of between 1 and 3, unless otherwise noted in the NRA. (For definitions of Technology Readiness Levels, see Appendix B of the NASA Technology Plan at http://technologyplan.nasa.gov)	The technology requirements guide future development of component and subsystem technologies, with emphasis on efficiency, miniaturization, integration, and resiliency.  The goal is to capture innovative ideas from the external community, to leverage emerging technologies, and to complement NASA capabilities in critical areas.  Successful proposals must outline a well-structured program (for up to three years) for development culminating in a proof-of-concept demonstration at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3-4 by the end of the effort for both the Advanced Measurement and Detection Technology and Large Aperture Technology. (NOTE: The Low Power Microelectronics Technology area requires that proposed activities have an entry TRL of 3 or 4 and that the activity demonstrate a minimum TRL 5 at the end of the proposed activity.) NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) in the ECT Program to develop proposals and execute proof of concept development and/or component breadboard validation. Subject to the availability of funds, selected proposal(s) would result in proof of concept development and/or component breadboard validation contract(s) for the selected partner(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide proof of concept development and/or component breadboard validation consistent with the efforts synopsized for each intended LaRC proposal. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel: This criterion evaluates the proposers' relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control: This criterion evaluates the proposers' ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3) Facilities: This criterion evaluates the proposers' facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria. In all cases, the responder must indicate on the cover page of the proposal (not part of 5-page allocation) the applicable instrument team(s). All responses should be sent to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: Greg Manuel, Mail Stop 469, Hampton, VA 23681. The preferred method of submission is via email to: g.s.manuel@larc.nasa.gov. The due date for submission is COB September 17, 2003. Procurement questions should be directed to Tom Weih, NASA Office of Procurement, 757-864-3878; c.t.weih@larc.nasa.gov Technical questions should be addressed to each of the technical points of contact indicated below for each technical area.

The spread system will be designed to test instrument concepts and technology in preparation for the development of a flight instrument. This DIAL/Lidar instrument requires an advanced avalanche photodiode to operate at moderate temperatures and large area detection for long-term lidar remote sensing at 2 um and longer wavelengths.  The development of advanced avalanche photodiode will enhance the capabilities to study CO2 profiling and global winds, detect wind shear for airline safety, profile aerosol and clouds, profile water vapor, monitor atmospheric pollutants (CO, etc.), and detect a large number of species in the near and mid-IR using active and passive remote sensing techniques.  NASA Langley Research Center is looking for potential partners to develop a large area photodetector with a 5 µm cutoff wavelength optimized for an operating temperature of -20o C. This work will involve establishing the highest operating temperature such that the desired device will meet the minimum requirements shown below:   i.	     Collecting Area for each Element ~ 100-500 µm, ii.      Bandwidth ³ 10 MHz, iii.	     Responsivity @ 2.00 µm ³ 60 A/W, iv.	 Quantum efficiency @ 2.00 µm ³ 60%, and  v.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Instrument is developed based-on multi-band detectors for NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS). This instrument is covering the range from 0.4 µm to 14.4 µm with 36 bands. A three bands imaging instrument, Geostationary Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer (GIFTS), is currently being developed that will provide images from 0.4 - 14.6 µm with high spectral resolutions. In addition, Gas and Aerosol Monitoring Sensorcraft (GAMS) has three bands that will cover the range from 0.4 - 1.6 µm. Each of the spectral bands is used to monitoring earth and atmospheric constituents. NASA Langley Research Center is looking for potential partners to develop technology, such as multi-color detector arrays from 0.4 µm to 15 µm. The ultimate goal is to be able to integrate practically all of the electronics required into a single integrated circuit (I.C.). This I.C. should have a three-dimensional architecture with signal detection and processing function integrated.

<SUBJECT>23 -- Request for Information - Vehicles
<DESC>This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI) for availability of maintenance and repair support of U.S.- manufactured vehicles procured in support of foreign assistance programs worldwide.   The Government is interested in industry ability to provide support for U.S-manufactured vehicles procured for support of foreign assistance programs in countries such as Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Laos, etc.  

Background:  Pursuant to its authorities under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), U.S. Department of State provides support to foreign governments’ counter-narcotics and law enforcement programs throughout the world.   Part of this support entails provision of vehicles for use by host country and U.S. personnel serving overseas.  

 INL endeavors to procure vehicles manufactured in the United States whenever possible but the availability of parts and maintenance support for such vehicles is problematic in many areas of the countries in which they are operated .    Locally available maintenance support is critical to the effectiveness of these program resources.  INL is requesting information from U.S. automakers concerning the availability of maintenance support for their products overseas. 

Industry is invited to send comments/information via email to Mary Pat Hayes-Crow at hayes-crowmp2@state.gov or Timothy E. Henderson at hendersonte@state.gov.  INL would like to receive comments by 4 pm ET October 10, 2003.

<SUBJECT>Y -- Construction Excellance - Ft. Pierce, Fl.
<DESC>WRITTEN EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FOR CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE FOR A NEW US COURTHOUSE, FT. PIERCE, FLORIDA  

WRITTEN EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FOR CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW U. S. COURTHOUSE-FT. PIERCE, FLORIDA-GS-04P-03-EXC-0033. The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in public construction and is presently soliciting written expressions of interest and assurance of bonding capacity letters from qualified general contractors (GC) desiring to compete in the procurement process for the subject construction project. GSA intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract, utilizing successive target prices throughout the source selection process, to obtain the GC that offers the best overall value to the Government. The selected GC must demonstrate a commitment to construction excellence, proposing and maintaining a viable team organization and by adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project. The Government will utilize the Source Selection process in accordance with FAR Part 15.1, Best Value Continuum-FAR 15.101, and the Tradeoff process FAR 15.101-1 to select the GC that offers the best overall value. The site selected by the Government for the new United States Courthouse will be in the Central Business District of Ft. Pierce, Florida. The facility will include approximately 10,994 square meters (118,334 gross square feet) including 34 secure (inside) parking spaces and 73 on-grade parking spaces. The facility will be occupied by the Federal District Court,  Magistrate Court, Bankruptcy Court, District Clerk, Probation, Pretrial Services, Federal Defender, U.S. Attorneys Office, U.S. Marshals Service and the GSA.  The estimated total construction cost for the project is estimated to range between $25,000,000 and $26,500,000 with occupancy planned for 4th quarter of FY 2007. This procurement is advertised on an unrestricted basis with an approximate construction time of 545 calendar days. The North American Industry Classification System Code (s) (NAICS) for this procurement is 233220. The project will be in Metric Units of Measure. Utilizing FAR Part 15 and formal Source Selection procedures the GC will be competitively chosen. The Trade-Off process at FAR Part 15.101 allows award to other than the lowest priced proposal therefore, participants are urged to submit all proposals on their best terms possible as it is the Governments intent to make award without discussion in accordance with FAR 15.306 (3), Qualified offerors electing to participate in the name of newly formed partnerships, corporations, joint ventures and/or any other business entity or arrangement will be required to provide the government with legal proof of union upon submission. Under this procedure all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price (15. 101- a (2), thereby magnifying the importance of each offeror’s past and present stated ability to perform at a very high rate of technical competence and to submit all offers on the best terms possible. The procurement process is structured in 4 Stages as follows: STAGE I- In order to become eligible to compete for the award of this project qualified GCs must, within 30 days of the publication of this notice or no later than Close Of Business (COB) August 18, 2003, submit a one page letter of interest (include an address and point of contact that you wish the subsequent RFP package to be mailed) along with a statement letter from a bonding corporate surety, on their (the surety’s) letterhead, certifying their ability to obtain bonding capacity commensurate with the Estimated Construction Cost of at least $26,500,000 (Ceiling Price). Corporate sureties offered must appear on the list contained in the Department of Treasury Circular 570 “Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Reinsuring Companies or Acceptability of Individual Sureties” in accordance with FAR 28.202 and 203 (http://www.fms.treas.gov/c570/index.html). These two letters (letter of interest and bonding) must be submitted to the attention of Mr. R. Butler, Sr. Contracting Officer, General Services Administration, Property Development Division, 25th Floor, 401 West Peachtree Street, N.W-Atlanta, Georgia 30308–again, no later than COB August 18, 2003. In order to facilitate the milestones set for the project and the sequence of events relative to convening the formal Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) and other activities, offerors failing to submit the required Stage I data as required and in the timeframe stated will be ineligible to compete for this procurement. Late and/or incomplete submissions will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.214-7 and may render the offeror ineligible for further participation. Electronic submissions (faxes, e-mails, etc.) are not allowed during any stage of this process. STAGE-II-upon notification from GSA via Request for Proposal (RFP), offerors responding accordingly to Stage I will be required to submit, under separate cover, a target price (Cost and Profit separated) (IMPORTANT NOTE: In order to assist in maintaining the ceiling price and related budgets, Profit Percentages offered in Stage II must remain constant throughout the process and will not be subject to change throughout the various pricing stages for those selected. The amount of profit may change due to cost fluctuations but not the proposed percentage),  based on approximately 20%-35% completed concept documents (provided in the RFP) and technical evaluation factor data relative to this project as follows: (1) Past Experience (2) Past Performance , (3) Key Personnel Data  and (4) Project Management Plan-Technical Approach-Accounting System-Management of Extended Overhead Cost . Details and expanded versions relative to these factors will be contained in the subsequent RFP package. STAGE III-Following the receipt and scoring of the Stage II data and the evaluation/analysis of the price proposal, a shortlist of not more than three offerors will be selected and provided an agenda to compete in an evaluated  Interactive Project Participation Stage whereby they will be required to independently participate in a (5) Value Engineering Workshop(s) for at least 3 days with a maximum of three (3) attendees from each firm eligible to participate and to submit (6) Cost Saving Ideas and Concepts ,complete a (7) Constructability Review(s) and at least one (8) Independent Estimate during design development . The participants will be paid a pre-determined moderate stipend for these services. Upon completion and scoring of this stage the participants will again be asked to submit a target price (cost and profit) (same profit percentage as Stage 1) at approximately 50%-65% design completion along with a subcontracting plan (large businesses only) relative to the proposed price. The SSEB will then combine the target price along with the previous technical scores from each previous stage to select the participant that offers the best overall value to the Government by establishing a firm target price and a commitment to not exceeding the ceiling price of $26,500,000. Stage IV-(Award-CM Services) during this stage the selected GC will work in equanimity with the A-E of record, via a written contractual agreement, not to exceed the pre-determined amount (amount included in RFP) to be paid following contract award, to finalize the design to 100% completion within the committed ceiling price. Upon design completion the Government will negotiate with the selected contractor to establish a Firm Fixed Priced contract noting that the submitted profit percentage remained unchanged. Should negotiations between the final selected GC and the Government reach an impasse the Government, in accordance with FAR 15.405 (d), will refer the matter to a level above the Contracting Officer and request permission to undertake negotiations with the next highest ranked previously short-listed offeror. Award will be based on availability of funds in accordance with FAR 52.232-14. Prior to the Interactive Participation Stage III and submission of price proposals a Pre-Proposal Conference and a Socio-Economic Program Meeting (networking session) will be scheduled with offerors to entertain inquiries concerning the scope of work and related issues. The networking session allows for the marketing and exchange of information with small businesses with potential prime contractors to facilitate marketing opportunities, business ventures and employment opportunities. Prior to award of this contract to a large business a subcontracting plan must be negotiated in accordance with FAR Part 19 which demonstrates a proactive effort to achieve the following minimum small business goals for all subcontracted work: Total Small Businesses (40%), Small Disadvantaged Businesses (8%), Small Women-Owned Businesses (5%), Service-Disabled Veteran (3%) and HubZone (2.5%). All submittals must clearly indicate the solicitation number (GS-04P-03-EXC-0033) on the face of the envelope.  Late submittals will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.215-10.

<CONTACT>Peggy Dube, (508) 233-4481
<DESC>NA This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are b eing requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a full and open competition combined synopsis/solicitation DAAD16-03-R-0027, for non-developmental Combat Eye Protection, which may require minor modifications (such as color, type of re tention strap, information contained in the use and care manual) to meet government requirements. The applicable NAICS Code for this acquisition is 315999 with a size standard of 500 employees. This synopsis/solicitation is prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement will constitute the only solicitation. A request for a hard copy of this RFP will not be honored. The Combat Eye Protection shall be availabl e in two forms:  spectacles and goggles, each with a carrying case and Use and Care Manual. All designs submitted must provide ballistic protection for the eye in both clear and sunglass configurations in order to be considered for this effort. Ballistic p rotective lenses shall pass a ballistic test. The ballistic test shall be conducted as specified in MIL-STD-662E with the following exceptions:  electronic velocity detection devices (light beam or acoustic type) may be used to determine the velocity of th e projectile, such devices placed no less than 8 inches and no more than 24 inches from the target; compressed gas propulsion of the projectile may be used. The eyewear shall be mounted on an Alderson 50th percentile male head form in the as-worn position.  The 0.002 inch thick aluminum foil witness sheet shall be mounted within 14 millimeters of the eyewear behind the area of impact. Spectacles shall be hit once with a 0.15 caliber, 5.8 grain, T37 shaped projectile at 640 to 660 feet per second at normal in cidence to the lens within a 1-inch diameter at a point centered on the horizontal centerline and 32 mm from the vertical centerline. Goggles shall be hit twice with a 0.22 caliber, 17 grain, T37 shaped projectile at 550 to 560 feet per second (once on the  left side and once on the right) at normal incidence to the lens within a 1-inch diameter at a point centered on the horizontal centerline and 32 mm from the vertical centerline, and again at the centerline if appropriate. The eyewear shall be considered a failure if the aluminum foil witness sheet is punctured or if the lens is cracked. Additionally, the Combat Eye Protection shall meet the following performance requirements: All spectacle and goggle designs submitted shall meet the appropriate (spectacle  or goggle) ANSI Z87.1 requirements.  Spectacle and goggle designs must be available in both clear and sunglass configurations. It is preferable that sunglass lenses be neutral grey. Lenses must be capable of being removed and replaced easily without the a id of tools. It is highly desired that eyewear accommodate prescription users while still providing ballistic protection (goggle also to still provide wind/dust protection in Rx configuration). To satisfy this need, eyewear may either be compatible with ex isting military prescription eyewear/inserts or shall provide a prescription lens carrier designed to accommodate a wide range of prescriptions manufactured from CR39 plastic, and shall be durable and capable of withstanding rigorous use by soldiers in a f ield environment. No more than two (2) types of lenses (or four exposed surfaces), including prescription inserts, shall be arranged in front of the eyes in any configuration. Use and Care manuals should describe the various configurations of the eyewear, use and adjustment of the eyewear, as well as care/maintenance/cleaning procedures associated with the eyewear. Eyewear should be comfortable and capable of fit ting a wide range of people, be compatible with Military helmets (PASGT, CVC, MICH), provide for good field of view, and be capable of being used while firing weapons and using night vision devices. Any adjustments should be easy to make. Goggles should pr ovide adequate seal around the eyes to provide sand/dust/wind protection. With the exception of lenses, components of the eyewear shall be subdued in color, such as black, tan, or green. Goggles should weigh no more than 4.4 ounces. Spectacles should weigh  no more than 1.7 ounces (with Rx carrier). Finished parts are free of any sharp/rough edges that could result in discomfort or abrasion to the face. Eyewear should come with a durable carrying case capable of carrying the eyewear and at least one set of s pare lenses. Cases that can be easily attached to the soldierÃ¢Â€Â™s load bearing equipment are preferable. Additionally, Goggle designs should provide wind/dust protection and come with a flame resistant strap. Offerors shall have the option to propose a spectacle and/or goggle design. As part of the proposal, the Offeror shall submit product samples. The Offeror shall submit ten (10) of each spectacle design and ten (10) of each goggle design being proposed, at no cost to the Government. Clear and sunglass lenses shall be provided with each item (ballistic protective photochromic lenses may be used in lieu of separate clear and sunglass lenses). If multiple sizes are available, a representative of each size shall  be submitted as part of the 10 samples for each design. No more than three (3) spectacle designs and no more than three (3) goggle designs may be proposed by any one Offeror. Offerors are also required to submit a hard copy Technical proposal. The proposa l must include a comparison of the performance of the submitted product(s) to the requirements of ANSI Z87.1. Product literature, such as Use and Care instructions, promotional brochures, etc. that describe how the product meets the Combat Eye Protection r equirements stated herein will also be provided. Any requirements that cannot be fully addressed via the product literature shall be addressed in a written proposal not to exceed three [3] pages for each proposed design. Vendors shall submit a Price propos al that provides the cost/per item for the initial items (up to 200), as well as the price for the optional quantity up to 45,000 items in economic ordering quantities. This shall be done for each spectacle and goggle design proposed. Vendors shall submit a Manufacturing proposal, not to exceed six (6) pages total, which describes the following: address whether the eyewear is currently in production, or when the eyewear will be in production if not being produced already; current and maximum production rate  (or anticipated production rate if the eyewear is not currently in production); whether textile components are entirely U.S. made (identifying which textile components are not US made, if any, and what action will be taken to transition procurement of the se textiles to a domestic source within the next 6 months); and how the eyewear complies with the Buy American Act (with specifics as to which components are not made in the US and where these components are currently being manufactured). This manufacturin g information shall be provided for each design proposed. Vendors shall submit a written proposal, not to exceed two (2) pages total, describing the warranty offered with each of the proposed designs. Vendors shall submit a written past performance proposa l not to exceed two (2) pages total, which describes their recent, relevant experience in providing protective eyewear. The Past Performance Proposal shall contain the names of references, points-of-contact for the company referenced, and current telephone  and fax numbers for the points of contact. Proposal submission shall consist of two volumes:  Technical, Manufacturing, Warranty and Past Performance shall be one volume with four severable sections ( submit original and 6 copies). Price and all representations and certifications (see FAR 52.212-3 and DFARS 252.212-7000) shall be the second volume (submit original and 2 copies). Offerors wishing to be notified of amendments to this combined synopsis/ so licitation shall send an email to the email address cited below. The following areas, in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate offerorsÃ¢Â€Â™ proposals and product samples:  Technical, Price, Manufacturing, Warranty, and Past Performanc e. The Technical area is greater in importance than the Price area, which is slightly more important than the Manufacturing area, which is more important than the Warranty area, which is slightly more important than the Past Performance area. Together, the  Technical area and the Price area are of greater importance than all other areas combined. Questions concerning this combined synopsis/solicitation shall be submitted in writing to Peggy.Dube @natick.army.mil no later than October 1, 2003.  Telephone inqu ires will not be accepted.

Written Proposal, Test Data and Product Liter ature will be evaluated for a) Documentation against ANSI Z87.1, b) Product Literature and c) Use and Care Manual(s), which are in descending order of importance. Product Sample will be evaluated for a) Ballistic Characteristics, b) Human Factors, c) Physi cal Characteristics and d) Carrying Case, where Sub-factor a) is of greater importance than Sub-factor b. Sub-factor b is of much greater importance than Sub-factor c). Sub-factor c) is of equal importance to Sub-factor d). Sub-factor a) is more important than all other Sub-factors combined. Pricing shall be evaluated for realism based on competitive pricing received from offerors and/or comparison with similar items. The Manufacturing Proposal will be evaluated for:  1) Item is either currently in producti on or can be production-ready within six months, 2) Production capability, or anticipated production capability is sufficient to meet the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s projected needs of 5000 units per month, 3) All textile components are entirely U.S. made OR the con tractor has a plan in place to transition procurement of non-US-made textiles to a domestic source within the next six months, and 4) Items comply with the Buy American Act, which are in descending order of importance. The Warranty Proposal will be evaluat ed for:  1) Minimum of one-year warranty, 2) Replacement of defective items at no charge, 3) Warranty covers defects in material and workmanship. All warranty subfactors are of equal importance. Past Performance will be evaluated for quality workmanship/pr oduct, customer responsiveness, and timeliness of deliveries for the same or similar items. Initial samples from each vendor shall be subjected to ballistic testing. Non-compliance with ballistic requirements will result in automatic elimination of a desig n from further consideration. Based on Best Value Source Selection and available funding, the U.S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, located at the U. S. Army Soldier Systems Center, Natick, MA will award one or more purch ase orders, each for up to 200 spectacles and/or 200 goggles, for further test and evaluation. Procured items will be subjected to the following:  Items will be technically tested under both laboratory and field conditions, as well as assessed for Safety. Field testing of spectacles and goggles shall include an assessment of fit, comfort, stability, compatibility with helmets, perception of weight when worn, appe arance, clarity of vision, field of view, ability to sight & fire weapons and use optical augmentation, ease of changing lenses, durability, resistance to fogging, ease of cleaning, minimization of glint and glare, adequacy/design of carrying case, adequac y of instruction booklet, Rx compatibility, and overall user acceptance/preference. Goggles will also be assessed for seal, adequacy of strap, ease of adjusting strap, and wind/dust protection. Laboratory testing shall include an assessment of optical char acteristics, weight, environmental resistance, chemical resistance, sand and dust infiltration (goggles only) and workmanship. Safety of the items will also be assessed (to include review of level of ANSI Z87.1 compliance and flame resistance of goggle str ap). Field-testing and Safety are of equal and most importance. Laboratory testing is of less importance than either Field-testing or Safety. Unit cost and manufacturing capability will be taken into consideration as part of the final down-select as well. Unit cost and manufacturing capability are of equal importance. Technical testing is more important than either cost or manufacturing capability. It will take approximately eight (8) months from the time of award of a purchase order until the completion of  the government user evaluation and down-selection. If items are evaluated acceptable in the criteria defined above, the Government may exercise an option to procure up to a maximum quantity of 45,000 spectacles and 45,000 goggles with one or more companie s based on the results of technical testing, cost and manufacturing capability. Vendors are cautioned that their products must comply with Berry Amendment restrictions (see DFARS 252.225-7012 regarding any textiles) in order to receive award for the option al production quantities. The Government will incorporate successful designs into the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s Direct Vendor Program to support future procurements. The single most successful spectacle and single most successful goggle design may be subjected to operational testing for potential Type Classification and future integration of Laser protective technology. The required delivery of the initial quantity of 200 items is 30 calendar days after award of purchase order(s).
