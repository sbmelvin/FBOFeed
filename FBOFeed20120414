<DESC>Huertgen Forest WWII Battlefield Research 


1.0	INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND:   The Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) conducts global search, recovery, and laboratory operations to identify unaccounted for Americans from past conflicts in order to support DoD's personnel accounting efforts.  To overcome the challenges associated with investigating ground losses, JPAC proposes a contract to assist in the research and investigation for a large ground loss incident.  JPAC requires an organization with proven archeological and historical research, GIS and analysis capability.  The organization will have demonstrated their capability through publication in professional journals.  The scope of this requirement is limited to a historic document review and a GIS assessment for US Servicemen missing from the 112th Infantry Regiment during the Battle of Huertgen Forest.
  

2.0 DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES:  The contracted organization will assist JPAC by providing skills and resources to assess areas with a high probability of containing remains of missing US servicemen.  This project will require two tasks and one deliverable.  The contracted organization will conduct an analysis of all available records of the battle, post-battle, and post war activities in the area and provide an assessment on the estimated location of foxholes and other potential features in the areas where the 112th Infantry Regiment fought during 2-16 November 1944.  This project will require an examination of two target areas:  the vicinity east of Vossenack where the 2nd Battalion, 112th Infantry Regiment held their positions for several days and the larger area between Vossenack and Schmidt, where the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 112th Infantry Regiment fought to gain control of Schmidt.
  37 servicemen from the 112th Infantry Regiment remain missing in action from the Huertgen engagement.  Research indicates remains may be located in original foxholes along the ridgeline east of Vossenack, in isolated burials in the vicinity of Schmidt and Kommerscheidt, or buried as unknowns in an American military cemetery.  EOD teams, construction companies and WWII enthusiasts have recovered human remains from these areas in the past few years.  These recoveries indicate that additional remains may be recovered from the area.  

Historical Review: Background research sources (e.g. After Action Reports, Witness Accounts, Enemy Reports of the action, all other documents and sources that relate to missing Americans from the Huertgen campaign.) 

GIS Analysis: Conduct a thorough search for pre-battle, coterminous to the battle, and post-battle aerial and land photography of the battlefield.
  This will be interpreted to identify landmarks and features that may relate in any way to missing American personnel.  Goereferencing and orthorectifying imagery as is reasonably possible

2.0	Report: The analytical report will include:  the historical review, geospatial analysis (to include a geospatial imagery packet), and analytical assessments as to number of recoverable remains in the area, locations in Vossenack, Kommerscheidt, Schmidt and the Kall valley estimated with high probability of containing remains and specific recommendations for site survey or field activities.

(End of clause)<BR><BR>The RAPIDGate Program enables electronic verification of identity and access privileges at Fort McCoy?s access control points (ACPs), thereby improving security and streamlining access to the installation.
Access Privilege Management
Companies choosing to participate in the RAPIDGate Program will have streamlined access onto the installation. Participants will have access through all gates that size permits (Main Gate, Gate 5, Gate 15 and Gate 20) and will only be subject to RANDOM vehicle inspections. At the Main Gate RAPIDGate participants will be able to utilize either lane, enabling fast access onto the installation through that gate. 
 Companies choosing not to participate in the RAPIDGate Program will be required to access the installation through the Main Gate, utilizing the commercial lane only. To enter the installation a pass is required for each person. Currently the maximum pass period is 30 days.  Effective December 1, 2010, maximum day pass will be reduced to 14 days and on April 1, 2011 only a one day pass will be issued.  To obtain a pass, you will be required to go to Vehicle Registration at the Welcome Center, show identification (i.e. driver?s license), vehicle registration, proof of insurance, contract award letter and/or bill of lading to obtain a pass to the installation. NO PASSES WILL BE ISSUED AT THE GATE. Vehicle Registration hours are Monday ? Friday 7:30a.m. ? 4:00p.m.  Significant delays may result from choosing to access the installation by obtaining a one day pass.  In which The Government will not be held responsible for any access delays.  Contractor may not at any time request consideration as a result of choosing to access the installation using the day pass process.  
Enrollment/Registration
Companies that service Fort McCoy may enroll in the RAPIDGate Program by calling 1-877-RAPIDGate (1-877-727-4342).  The Program will confirm with the installation that the company has legitimate business on the installation. Once the company has enrolled, its employees can register at the self-service Registration Station located at the Fort McCoy Welcome Center.
The RAPIDGate Program confirms the individual?s employment status with the company, and then performs identity authentication and background screening.  Employees who qualify are issued a personalized RAPIDGate ID Badge.  The Program performs background screening on a regular basis to verify continued eligibility in the Program.
Questions about the Fort McCoy RAPIDGate Program should be addressed to info@rapidgate.com with the subject line RE: RAPIDGate Program, or to the Physical Security Branch, Directorate of Emergency Services at 608-388-4694.<BR><BR>If a Seller decides to include a trade-in offer as specified in the attached Salient Features, the "Unit Price" provided in Fedbid should reflect the unit price of the unit being quoted MINUS the trade-in price being offered.  The Seller should also specify in their "Seller Bid Specifications" the trade-in price being offered.  Quotes provided without trade-in pricing will be evaluated against quotes that reflect pricing after trade-in pricing has been incorporated.<BR><BR>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.

In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>
