<SUBJECT>B--INVESTIGATION OF DREDGING GUIDELINES TO MAINTAIN AND PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF OFFSHORE RIDGE AND SHOAL REGIMES/DETAILED MORPHOLOGIC EVALUTION OF OFFSHORE SHOALS - NSL NO. NT-06-02
<SOLNBR>0106RP39692

<CONTACT>Rhonda Fernandez Contract Specialist 7037871348     rhonda.fernandez@mms.gov;
<DESC>The U. S. Minerals Management Service (MMS) has a requirement for a scientific/technical study to be performed, the objective of which is to formulate and recommend offshore dredging guidelines to protect and maintain the geomorphic integrity of the ridge and shoal features found on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) which are being targeted as sand borrow sites for beach and coastal restoration efforts. The guidelines are to be developed through the implementation of a field measurement program in and around a representative sand ridge/shoal field within Federal waters and the subsequent application of a numerical computer modeling effort. The modeling effort will encompass the integration of a phase-resolving wave and hydrodynamic model coupled with a two-dimensional sand transport model to assess the changes in the physical regime on and around the shoal feature as a result of offshore dredging and the subsequent removal of large volumes of sand. Using the information and results obtained from the field and modeling efforts, the prospective contractor will develop and recommend dredging guidelines such that the integrity of shoal features located on the OCS can be maintained and the overall environmental risk to the physical and biological environments on the shoals and within the ridge systems can be minimized or avoided in the advent of dredging operations. The prospective contractor will be required to prepare a scientific/technical report containing all relevant information pertaining to the field and modeling portions of the study and all technical information collected and analyses undertaken. The report must include a complete analysis and discussion of the recommendations/dredging guidelines that should be adopted to preserve the integrity of sand shoals situated in OCS waters if they are to be considered as long-term sources of sand borrow material for beach nourishment and restoration projects and activities. The format and organization for the manuscript will be agreed upon between the Program Manager (PM) and the MMS-COTR prior to preparation. A draft final report shall be submitted to the MMS for review prior to preparation of the final document.  The prospective contractor will be required to prepare draft and final Technical Summaries in the format prescribed by MMS after completion and acceptance of the final report, as well as a scientific journal paper describing the study, its purpose, methods, conclusions, etc. for submission to an appropriate technical journal.  The prospective contractor will be required to present details of this study at a scientific/technical conference as agreed upon between the Program Manager and the MMS COTR. It is expected that the work effort will take a total of 32 months.  The cost of this effort is Not to Exceed $400,000. The MMS Leasing Division, and specifically, the Division's Marine Minerals Branch has been focusing on integrating geologic and environmental information, developed through partnerships with coastal States and contracted or cooperative study efforts, to identify suitable Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) sand deposits for beach and coastal restoration and to provide needed environmental information in regards to environmental management of these resources.  The MMS has jurisdiction over all mineral resources on the Federal Outer Continental Shelf.  Public Law 103-426, enacted October 31, 1994, gave the MMS the authority to convey, on a noncompetitive basis, the rights to OCS sand, gravel, or shell resources for shore protection, beach or wetlands restoration projects, or for use in construction projects funded in whole or part or authorized by the Federal Government.   Offshore sand dredging for beach nourishment projects employ hydraulic dredges almost exclusively and are normally either cutterhead or hopper-type dredges.  Regardless of the dredging method employed, however, the process could potentially result in adverse effects on various components of the marine or coastal environment if the possible effects are not properly assessed pre-dredging, and if mitigation, in the form of area avoidance or engineering modifications is not employed properly.  The primary areas under investigation on the OCS as sand borrow sites have been the submerged sand shoals located offshore.  Some of these shoals have already been dredged and are being considered as a long-term source of material for beach replenishment efforts. Investigators have postulated that, from a physical impact perspective, the disappearance or deflation of these shoal features could have serious consequences relative to changes to wave patterns between the shoal and the shoreline. This subsequently could result in adverse changes in sand transport patterns and shoreline erosion and accretion rates. In addition to possible adverse effects on the physical environment, subsequent habitat changes and effects on local biology could be encountered should the shoal morphology drastically be altered. There is likely a critical depth below which offshore shoals should not be dredged if wave action that sustains the shoals is to be maintained. Over the long term, if a shoal's volume is reduced, its relief off the seafloor would gradually become less as the shoal continues to evolve in balance with the newer reduced volume.  Presumably, following removal of some critical portion of a shoal's volume and subsequent shoal evolution, a critical depth of dredge cut might be "hit" over a significant enough portion of a shoal such that its long-term geomorphologic integrity would be threatened. Therefore, it might be possible to logically adopt a dredging guideline requiring that some minimum threshold volume of a shoal be maintained (presumably variable as a function of ambient water depth and other local physical environmental factors) in order to minimize this risk.   This is a 100% small business set aside being issued in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 19, Small Business Programs.   Interested parties must email their request for a copy of the Request for Proposal (RFP) to Rhonda Fernandez, Contract Specialist, Rhonda.Fernandez@mms.gov; fax: 703-787-1348, by 4:00 PM Eastern Time, Monday, April 10, 2006.   All inquiries must include the solicitation number, your full name, organization name, address, e-mail address, and phone and fax numbers.

<DESC>The U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a request for proposal (RFP) in anticipation of an award of contract(s) to acquire U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) or other stringent regulatory body (defined below) approved contraceptive implant along with the insertion device to USAID.  The base quantity is 72,000 sets.
  
A stringent regulatory authority (SRA) is a drug regulatory body that closely resembles FDA in standards utilized in its operations. Currently, countries that participate in the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) are considered to have stringent regulatory authorities. The ICH regulatory bodies include: the U.S. FDA; the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare; the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) centralized procedure; and the European Free Trade Area (represented by the Swiss Medic). The Canadian drug regulatory authority, the Therapeutic Products Directorate, Health Canada, is an observer to the ICH and is also considered a stringent regulatory authority. Other countries may be considered to have a stringent regulatory body if they have implemented ICH guidelines and resemble the U.S. FDA in operation, but would be considered by USAID on a case-by-case basis. 

The implants supplied to USAID under this contract shall have the expiration dating approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) or other stringent regulatory body of 60 months (5 years).  

The Government contemplates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract(s) resulting from this solicitation.
 
The Offeror must supply the following documentation to USAID:
(1)       Complete product description,   
(2)	evidence that the implants offered in response to this solicitation are manufactured in an ISO 9000 approved facility, 
(3)	evidence that the product and production/manufacturing facility have been approved by U.S. FDA or other stringent regulatory body, 
(4)	evidence that the product shelf life approved by U.S. FDA or stringent regulatory body is 5 years, 
(5)	long term stability data, 
(6)	any data to support that the product does not require climate controlled transport and storage, and
(7)	documented proof of any current registrations and in-process registrations.

Products purchased under this contract are for developing countries for use in family planning programs supported by USAID and in a full range of service delivery programs.

The authorized geographic code for procurement of goods and services under this contract is 935.

Performance under the basic contract shall be from the award date on the face of the contract through December 31, 2007. Four additional option years of performance will be from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2011.

The RFP is expected to be issued on or about late March 2006 and will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities website of the General Services Administration.  The publication of this notice or the RFP does not obligate the U.S. Government to make an award.

<DESC>The Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) Program is being transitioned to the Navy Unmanned Combat Air Systems (N-UCAS) Program.  The N-UCAS Advanced Development Program Office (ADPO) has a requirement to develop and demonstrate technologies and operational concepts that will provide effective, affordable, survivable, and supportable Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) systems.  In support of this requirement, the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to hold a limited competition to develop, build and test an aircraft carrier (CV) based Unmanned Combat Air System (UCAS) Demonstration System.  Participants will be limited to the current J-UCAS sources, which are:  The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Boeing Company (Boeing); and the Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (Northrop).  Boeing and Northrop are the only known responsible sources with the required technical expertise to satisfy the Government’s requirements.  Award to any source other than current J-UCAS participants would result in significant schedule delays as well as substantial duplication of costs that would not be recovered through full and open competition.  The Demonstration System effort will be structured to mature critical technologies and reduce risk for aircraft carrier integration of an operationally relevant UCAS with a Low Observable (LO) planform.  The N-UCAS demonstration shall include, but is not limited to, Carrier Control Approach (CCA) operations, launch and recovery, deck operations and supportability.  Activities will focus towards a suitability demonstration of a relevant LO planform aboard ship no later than 2011.  The UCAS demonstration system will include an Air Vehicle (AV) and Mission Control System (MCS) design approach.  All correspondence, Request for Proposals and Questions and Answers will be posted to the NAVAIR website at http://www.navair.navy.mil (select <Doing Business> and then select <Open Solicitations>).  A draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) is planned to be released in the May 2006 timeframe.  All questions and correspondence regarding this synopsis shall be sent to the Contracting Officer at Lori.Frame@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC SD) intends to solicit and award a single contract for all items to AAI Corporation (AAI), 124 Industrial Lane, Hunt Valley, MD 21030-3342 on a sole source basis. A requirement very similar to this requirement, published under Solicitation number N66001-05-R-0046, was intended to be awarded to Allied Aerospace (AA), 703 Middle Ground Boulevard, Newport News, Virginia 23606. AAI will utilize the 29-inch iSTAR Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that was developed by AA. The objective of this task is to integrate AAI's 29-inch iSTAR UAV command and control processes with the Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems (JAUS)- based Multi-Robot Operator Control Unit (MOCU) command and control system, modify the iSTAR UAV for automatic refueling from SSC San Diego's Automated UAV Mission System (AUMS) base platform and demonstrate the integrated AUMS during field trials in which the iSTAR UAV launches, flies preplanned waypoints, lands, refuels and returns to the air. Use of any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs and delays for the Government based on proprietary information controlled by AAI Corp. Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements. However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability by responding to this synopsis within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this notice.

 Uruguay-Brazil Electrical Interconnection Project.  The National Directorate of Energy and Nuclear Technology of Uruguay (“the Grantee”) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to perform technical assistance for the Uruguay-Brazil Electrical Interconnection Project.

The Governments of Uruguay and Brazil are working on expanding the capacity of the interconnection of the two countries’ electrical grids. As currently envisioned, the project would involve the construction of an approximately 400km-long transmission line that would interconnect the respective electrical systems.  The proposed design voltage is 500kV and an installed capacity of about 500MW.  

The objective of the Technical Assistance is to work with Uruguay’s National Directorate of Energy and Nuclear Technology of Uruguay’s Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mines to effectively analyze the operational, commercial and regulatory aspects of the project. The scope of the technical assistance also include the provision of Power System Simulator for Engineering (PSS/E) software, computers to run the software, and training, which will give DNETN the technical tools that they need to analyze electrical studies for the implementation of this and future regional electrical interconnection projects.

The tasks include:

•	Review and analyze similar completed and operating interconnection projects
•	Propose regulatory, commercial and operational framework 
•	Identify and assess potential sources of financing
•	Carry out preliminary review and assessment of environmental impacts
•	Carry out review and assessment of development impacts
•	Identify potential U.S.-based sources of supply
•	Prepare project implementation plan
•	Strengthen DNETN’s capacity to implement interconnection project through the provision of system software, hardware and related training
•	Prepare final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $441,350 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by 3:00PM, May 15, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

PART I – BACKGROUND INFORMATION

1.	Program Office:

DHHS/NIH/NCI/CCR/MOB/Molecular Pharmacology Section
      
2.	Project and Solicitation

Molecular Devices – SpectraMax M2

      3,	Purpose/Brief History:

a.	The Molecular Pharmacology Section, MOB, CCR, NCI is engaged in the understanding of the pharmacology of new anticancer agents. In addition, the Section is focused on the importance of genes associated with and that predict the risk of prostate cancer.
 b.	Our laboratory performs experiments in molecular and cell biology on a daily basis.  The 	SpectraMax M2 microplate spectrophotometer functions as both a fluorescence and 	absorbance reader making it highly useful for the routine assays that are carried out in the 	lab such as ELISAs, protein assays (Bradford), nucleic acid assays (A260 & PicoGreen), 	SNP genotyping, reporter assays using beta-galactosidase, cell proliferation and apoptosis 	assays as well as kinetic assays. 

	The SpectraMax M2 is unique in its ability to perform all of these assays as well as its 	performance specifications which include:

-	A reading capacity for dual mode (Fluorescence & Absorbance), in 1cm cuvette port and in 6- to 384- well picroplates.
-	Dual monochromators for tunable fluorescence wavelength selection between 250nm and 850nm and tunable absorbance weavelength selection between 200nm and 1000nm.
-	Agitation and temperature control from 4C to 45C.
-	Reads up to four EX/EM wavelength pairs per microplate for multi-flourophore assay design.
-	Fixed fluorescence spectral bandwidth of 9nm for improved resolution between EX/EM components. Fixed absorbance bandwidth of less or equal to 4nm.
-	Full wavelength scanning capability across the entire spectral range for defining actual EX and EM maxima. Performs spectral scans in user-defined increments as small as 1nm, and then can select assay wavelengths for actual maxima. Increased sensitivity for assay by working at actual conditions rather than using literature references.
-	Automatic PMT setting to adjust the optimum voltage for each well sample concentration and normalize the raw data to show RFU values. Selectively rereads wells at the optimal PTM setting.
-	PathCheck ™ sensor – only sensor of its kind not affected by temperature, and requires no accessories to measure the pathlength of samples in all individual wells.
-	SoftPro Max data analysis and instrument control software that is usable on both Macintosh and Windows interfaces with a single program. Software has the ability to design custom assay protocols including instrument settings, plate templates, sample spreadsheet calculations, and graphs of all data.

c.	The supplier (Molecular Devices) will provide the SpectraMax M2 	microplate fluorescence 	and absorbance spectrophotometer and SoftMaxPro software along with - Dell Notebook 	D505 bundle and lnitial Training Life Science
d.	There are no current plans for future procurements of this nature in subsequent fiscal 	years.

PART II – Facts and Reasons to Justify Other Than Full and Open Competition

The sole source acquisition is justified under the statutory authority contained in U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and the following authority contemplated by FAR 13.106(b)(1). "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, ... and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for."

The Molecular Devices SpectraMax M2 is a unique instrument in that it enables the user to run a vast number of assays on the same machine from fluorescence to absorbance. It also allows the user to work with data results on a Windows or Apple platform. This is important in our lab as we use both.  This instrument will allow the lab to complete current projects as well as work on new collaborations. Not acquiring this microplate reader could be detrimental to ongoing research.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Further information on DICCE requirements, including a draft Statement of Work, will be posted by Marcy 31, in lieu of March 24, as initially stated in the Industry Day(s) conference announcement, posted March 10, 2006. INDUSTRY DAY REGISTRATION FORMS ARE POSTED BELOW ALONG WITH THE INDUSTRY DAY(S) ANNOUNCEMENT. DE-RP52-06NA26990 -- DESIGN, INTEGRATION, CONSTRUCTION, COMMUNICATION, AND ENGINEERING (DICCE) SERVICES INDUSTRY DAY.  The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) will hold an Industry Day(s) conference for the DICCE acquisition beginning on April 18, 2006.  DICCE services include installation of radiation detection and communication equipment at international land border crossings, airports and seaports.  A more detailed description of the anticipated services was included in the Sources Sought Notice published at FedBizOpps on September 6, 2005.  The conference will be designed to enhance understanding of DICCE requirements, obtain Industry feedback, provide a networking forum for all interested parties, and maximize opportunities for small business participation.  The conference will be held at 1000 Independence Avenue (Forrestal Building), SW, Washington D.C. in the Forrestal Auditorium (Room GE-086) on April 18, 2006, beginning at 9:00 a.m.  An additional session will be held on April 19, 2006, if reservations exceed the capacity of the auditorium. Participants are asked to specify their preferred date (April 18 or 19) in the event an additional session is needed.  NNSA will attempt to honor preferences on a first-come, first-served basis, and will notify participants of their reserved date, should two sessions be held.  Due to the size of the auditorium and previous expressed interest, each firm is limited to 3 attendees. Advance registration is required.  Registration forms are posted with this announcement and must be received by close of business April 10, 2006.  In view of program operational requirements, attendance is limited to domestic firms.  Each attendee must present a valid photo I.D. (i.e. drivers license) to access the Forrestal Building.  Please arrive by 8:30 a.m. to allow time for badging and security processing.  Enter the building at the main entrance which is located at the southeast corner of Independence Avenue and Lâ€™Enfant Promenade and proceed to the VIP desk, which is located to your left before the security turnstiles.  The receptionist will verify your identity, have you sign-in, and issue you a visitorâ€™s badge.  A host will guide you to the Forrestal Auditorium. The conference agenda will include briefings on the programâ€™s mission and scope; description of prior acquisitions; and DICCE requirements.  It is anticipated that the Small Business Administration (SBA) will brief Industry on topics such as teaming arrangements and size standards, and that an SBA representative will answer individual questions following the public forum. A question and answer session will be held following these presentations. Interested firms are encouraged to submit questions in writing to the Contracting Officer prior to the Industry Day(s), but no later than close of business April 13, 2006.  Question forms will be available to conference attendees as well.  All questions and their answers will be posted to both the Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) and FedBizOpps following the conference.  Further information on DICCE requirements, including a draft Statement of Work, will be posted to the IIPS and FedBizOpps sites on or before March 24, 2006. Depending on the number of requests and time permitting, one-on-one meetings may be held with firms that submit a written request to the Contract Specialist no later than close of business April 7, 2006.  The one-on-one meetings are to enable individual companies or teams to ask questions and make comments/suggestions concerning the DICCE requirements and contracting strategy.  Appointments will be scheduled and time allotted based upon the number of firms responding.  Firms are encouraged to attend as a team, rather than requesting separate one-on-one meetings.  Firms requesting a session will be notified of appointment time and room location in the Forrestal Building via e-mail.  The following information must be provided to the Contract Specialist when requesting one-on-one sessions:  Firm name, number of persons attending, point of contact name, phone number and e-mail address.

<SUBJECT>A -- Lead Paint Test Kit Development; Request for Comments
<SOLNBR>LPTKD-1
<RESPDATE>041706
<ARCHDATE>04182006
<CONTACT>John  Schwemberger, Statistician, Phone 202-566-1972, Fax 202-566-0469, Email schwemberger.john@epa.gov
<DESC>Summary:

EPA is requesting information concerning the development of test kits or similar technologies for testing lead in paint that could be used by renovators, repair persons, and painters complying with a future EPA regulation for renovation, repair, and painting activities. This information will be considered in formulating EPA's policy and research decisions regarding the development of lead paint test kits. The lead paint test kits will allow renovators, repair persons, and painters to focus resources and identify locations where lead-based paint is present and reliably determine situations where appropriate preventive actions should be undertaken. 

Background:

EPA's proposed regulation for renovation, repair, and painting activities published in the January 10, 2006 Federal Register, and is available under docket ID number EPA-HQ-OPPT-2005-0049 at http:// www.regulations.gov/. You can also access the proposed rule directly at http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-TOX/ 2006/January/Day-10/t071.pdf. 

The proposed regulation calls for recognizing test kits that have a demonstrated probability of a negative response no more than 5% of the time for paint at or above the regulated lead level (i.e., kits with a false negative rate of no more than 5%). Under the proposed rule, these test kits could be used by trained and certified renovators in target housing to determine that the components affected by the renovation are free of lead-based paint. The proposed regulation also envisions the development of an improved, more accurate test kit that has: 

1. A demonstrated probability of a negative response no more than 5% of the time for paint at or above the regulated lead level (i.e., a false negative rate of no more than 5%). 
2. A demonstrated probability of a positive response no more than 10% of the time for paint below the regulated lead level (i.e., a false positive rate of no more than 10%). 

The planned effective dates of the renovation, repair, and painting regulation are based on improved test kits being commercially available approximately in 3 years. Readers seeking additional information, should refer to the proposed regulation published in the January 10, 2006 Federal Register.

Specifications:

EPA defines lead-based paint as any paint or other coating on a building component with either 1.0 milligrams or more lead per square centimeter or 0.5% or more lead by weight. The term "regulated lead level" refers to either of these two threshold numbers. A manufacturer, inventor, or vendor of a test kit or similar technology may choose either one of these numbers as the regulated level for demonstration and evaluation purposes. For the final regulation on renovation, repair, and painting activities, EPA would like a test kit or similar technology that meets the following specifications to be commercially available. The specifications below are consistent with those in the proposed regulation published in the January 10, 2006 Federal Register, and provide additional detail. 
Specifications: 
1. False negative rate of no more than 5% for paint above or equal to the regulated level. 
2. False positive rate of no more than 10% for paint below the regulated level. 
3. Cost of under $2 per test. 
4. Test results to be available within an hour. Test kit includes quality control samples so users can make sure the test kit is working properly when the test is conducted. 
5. The test kit can be reliably used by a renovator, repair person, or painter who has completed training in the use of the test kit, and who has been certified by an EPA, State, territorial, or tribal lead program. The test kit provides consistent results when used by any trained and certified renovator, repair person, or painter. Required test kit training is to be minimal, 2-3 hours. 

In addition, EPA is interested in a test kit or similar technology that can be applied to any paint in pre-1978 housing units regardless of the type of material (wood, metal, plaster, drywall, brick, concrete, etc.) beneath the paint.

Request for Comments:

EPA is requesting information on test kits and similar technologies for testing lead in paint in the form of comments provided to the Agency no later than April 17, 2006. Comments are requested on the following topics: 

1. The feasibility of developing a test kit or similar technology that meets the specifications in this document. 
2. Manufacturers who have or could develop a test kit or similar technology that meets the specifications in this document 
3. Current test kits or similar technologies for testing lead in paint that may meet the specifications in this document. 
4. Future test kits or similar technologies for testing lead in paint that will be available in approximately the next 3 years that may meet the specifications described in this document.

<DESC>This posting is now under solicitation number M-OAA-GH-POP-06-683.

The U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a request for proposal (RFP) in anticipation of an award of contract(s) to acquire U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) or other stringent regulatory body (defined below) approved contraceptive implant along with the insertion device to USAID.  The base quantity is 72,000 sets.
  
A stringent regulatory authority (SRA) is a drug regulatory body that closely resembles FDA in standards utilized in its operations. Currently, countries that participate in the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) are considered to have stringent regulatory authorities. The ICH regulatory bodies include: the U.S. FDA; the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare; the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) centralized procedure; and the European Free Trade Area (represented by the Swiss Medic). The Canadian drug regulatory authority, the Therapeutic Products Directorate, Health Canada, is an observer to the ICH and is also considered a stringent regulatory authority. Other countries may be considered to have a stringent regulatory body if they have implemented ICH guidelines and resemble the U.S. FDA in operation, but would be considered by USAID on a case-by-case basis. 

The implants supplied to USAID under this contract shall have the expiration dating approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) or other stringent regulatory body of 60 months (5 years).  

The Government contemplates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract(s) resulting from this solicitation.
 
The Offeror must supply the following documentation to USAID:
(1)       Complete product description,   
(2)	evidence that the implants offered in response to this solicitation are manufactured in an ISO 9000 approved facility, 
(3)	evidence that the product and production/manufacturing facility have been approved by U.S. FDA or other stringent regulatory body, 
(4)	evidence that the product shelf life approved by U.S. FDA or stringent regulatory body is 5 years, 
(5)	long term stability data, 
(6)	any data to support that the product does not require climate controlled transport and storage, and
(7)	documented proof of any current registrations and in-process registrations.

Products purchased under this contract are for developing countries for use in family planning programs supported by USAID and in a full range of service delivery programs.

The authorized geographic code for procurement of goods and services under this contract is 935.

Performance under the basic contract shall be from the award date on the face of the contract through December 31, 2007. Four additional option years of performance will be from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2011.

The RFP is expected to be issued on or about late March 2006 and will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities website of the General Services Administration.  The publication of this notice or the RFP does not obligate the U.S. Government to make an award.

<CONTACT>Alice Oberhausen, Contracting Officer, Phone 850-452-4616 x31106, Fax 850-452-9398, Email alice.oberhausen@navy.mil
<DESC>This procurement is for one solicitation, structured as a Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) for General Construction resulting in the award of three Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts for a base year and three Option years.  Each contract shall be awarded with a minimum guarantee of $50,000 applicable to the base year of the contract only .  The total not-to-exceed value for all four years (Base, plus three Options) of each of the three contracts is $11,250,000.00.  The total 4 year (base year and three option years) estimated construction costs for all three IDIQ contracts is not-to-exceed $45,000,000.

After award of the initial contracts, the three successful offerors will compete for task orders based on using one of these three processes:  Best Value to the Government using trade off processes, or Low Price, or  Low Price Technically Acceptable. The Government will provide full plans and specifications for each task order or detailed shop drawings and a statement of work. The estimated dollar range of task orders to be issued is $25,000 - $3,000,000. The work will consist of General Construction  projects falling under NAICS Code Sectors 236, 237, and 238, with emphasis on work in 238 sector.  The size standards are $31,000,000 for NAICS 236 and 237 and $13,000,000 for NAICS code 238.  Contractors who certify themselves as small businesses must be small businesses in each of the NAICS codes.
The Government reserves the right to award one of the contracts to a qualified 8(a) firm, 
provided an acceptable proposal is submitted, price and technical factors considered. The remaining two contracts will be made to the firms considered to be the Best Value and will be competed UNRESTRICTED.  If sufficient qualified 8(a) firms apply and are considered “Best Value”, it is possible that more than one contract will be awarded to 8(a) firms.  We will utilize two-step, Source Selection Procedures for this procurement. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and the use of a trade-off process when it may be in the best interest of the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror(s) or other than the highest technically rated offeror(s).  Phase 1 of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to select approximately five – seven offerors based on factors that include:  Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Scheduling, and Small Business Subcontracting Effort.  Phase I factors relate to the base year and each of the three option year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including administrative, training, family housing, dormitory, and community support type facilities, not just the seed project identified in Section 00202 of the RFP.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit additional information on Factor B (Technical) pertinent to the seed project and price proposals for that project. PHASE I OF THE SOLICITATION WILL BE POSTED 10 APRIL 2006 AND WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD AT THE NAVFAC WEBSITE, URL ADDRESS:  WWW.ESOL.NAVFAC.NAVY.MIL  CONTRACTORS' RESPONSE TO PHASE ONE OF THE SOLICITATION WILL BE DUE 10 MAY 2006.  THE CONTRACTING OFFICE, ALICE OBERHAUSEN, MAY BE CONTRACTED VIA E-MAIL AT:
ALICE.OBERHAUSEN@NAVY.MIL OR BY PHONE: 850-452-4616 X 3110.

<SOLNBR>PR-NC-06-10267

<CONTACT>OTELIA D. NEWSOME, Contract Specialist, Phone: (919) 541-3164, E-Mail: newsome.otelia@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement for Support for the Metals, Minerals, and Energy Sector.   With the finalization of the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy in July of 1999, the EPA introduced and outlined its risk-based air toxics program, which includes both regulatory and non-regulatory programs and actions.  In addition, the Integrated Urban Air Toxics Strategy lists the goals of the EPA?s air toxics program, which are as follows:  (1) reduce the incidence of cancer attributable to exposure to hazardous air pollutants by 75% nationally; (2) reduce national non-cancer risks substantially; and (3) address risks which are disproportionately posed on specific subpopulations and geographic areas.  In order to accomplish these goals, the EPA has integrated its air toxics program into four components.  The first component is source specific regulatory programs.  This component includes the development of MACT standards under section 112(d), MACT or generally available control technology (GACT) standards 112(k), residual risk standards under 112(f), and other standards to regulate emissions of air toxics from specific sources.  The second component includes national, regional, and community-based initiatives which focus on multi-media and cumulative risk, such as the Great Water program and EPA?s persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals (PBT) initiative.  The third component, National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA), will provide quantitative estimates of the health risks associated with air toxics on a variety of geographic scales ranging from national-scale assessments to local-scale analyses.  The fourth and final component of EPA?s air toxics program is education and outreach. The purpose of this contract is to provide support for the first component, source specific regulatory programs.  The source specific regulatory component of the EPA?s air toxics program includes the development of technology-based standards for both major and area sources, residual risk standards, as well as, other standards development activities.  EPA anticipates the award of two (2) cost-plus fixed fee level of effort type contracts with a base period of performance of six (6) months, with four (4) additional twelve-month option periods. The total duration of the proposed contracts is fifty-four (54) months.  The procurement will be processed as a full and open competition with a partial small business set-aside.   The first contract, to be awarded  on the basis of full and open competition, will consist of 5,000 base quantity labor hours and 15,000 optional quantity labor hours for the base period plus 10,000 base quantity labor hours and 30,000 optional quantity labor hours for the four option periods.  For the first contract, the total contract maximum is 180,000 labor hours.  The second contract, to be awarded as a 100% small business set-aside, will consist of 5,000 base quantity labor hours and 15,000 optional quantity labor hours for the base period plus 10,000 base quantity labor hours and 30,000 optional quantity labor hours for the four option periods.  For the second contract, the total contract  maximum is 180,000 labor hours.  This effort is not a follow-on effort.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 with a size standard of $6.5M in average annual receipts over the last three years.  The draft Statement of Work (SOW), draft evaluation criteria, and Conflict of Interest (COI) clauses can be reviewed at  EPA's website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  The solicitation  is scheduled to be issued on or around April 18, 2006.  Proposals will be due approximately 30 calendar days after issuance of the solicitation.   The solicitation and amendments will be available via the World Wide Web at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  Firms are encouraged to access the solicitation and amendments via the Internet.  If you obtain a copy of the solicitation via the Internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitation is posted to ensure that you have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.  Telephone and FAX requests will not be honored.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  The Government is not obligated or committed to award any contract as a result of this notice.  See Note 26.

<CONTACT>Thomas Bordone, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-254-2319, Fax 202-254-2271, Email thomas.bordone@dhs.gov
<DESC>A critical component of the Department of Homeland Security’s Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) nuclear countermeasures architecture is a passive gamma and neutron radiation detection portal (termed the Advanced Spectroscopic Portal) suitable for examining cargo containers, trucks, personally owned vehicles, mail and bundled cargo.  The Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) system will use the full gamma radiation spectrum and total neutron count rate from the inspected material to make a detection and identification decision.  The gamma radiation detectors in the ASP system utilize thallium enhanced sodium iodide (NaI) crystals to absorb the gamma radiation, and with the assistance of the electronics, the device records the energy of the gamma radiation.  Since each isotope in nature gives off a unique energy pattern, the collected data is used to evaluate whether the radiating material is a threat to the public or benign.   

To obtain contractors to produce and supply these gamma radiation detectors, DNDO is conducting a full and open competition, with the selected firms being awarded production contracts.  This solicitation will result in multiple Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contracts.  Vendors are requested to propose on various production levels as specified in the solicitation.  In addition, a portion of the requirement has been set-aside for small business.

A draft of this solicitation was posted on FedBizOps on February 10, 2006.  The final version of solicitation has been revised to reflect various changes and to incorporate the results of the industry comment on the draft.  Also attached are the questions/comments received on the draft, with the Government’s response.  In addition, attached is a redline version of the draft solicitation which reflects the changes that have been made between the draft solicitation that was published on February 10, 2006 and final version of the RFP.  In the event of any inconsistency between these documents, the final version of the RFP shall govern.  Vendors should note that hard copies of the proposals are to be submitted to the address specified in Section L.4.  Any questions on this solicitation must be sent no later than 2:00, March 30, 2006, as specified in section L.3.9.  Offerors may send electronic copies of their proposal in addition to the hard copies, however, offerors should note that the electronic transmissions of the proposals are not secure, and are therefore not a requirement of the response.  It is the Respondent’s responsibility to periodically review either of these websites for notices, amendments, updates, questions and answers and changes to the posted information.

Numbered note 2 is applicable to this acquisition.

The TRACER system will have a foliage, building and ground penetration capability, to include detection of small roadside targets and buried weapons caches in the open in addition to vehicle-sized targets  under foliage.  A TRACER system consists of a radar, set of spares and ground components. The ground components include hardware and software necessary for the transmission of radar imagery and data from the radar system onboard the aircraft to the ground  for display, exploitation, mission planning and control. The Common Data Format for the ground station software is NITF 2.1 or higher. The software will provide detection reports with appropriate time-tag, geolocation and other information.  Three TRACER systems will have to be designed, developed, integrated and tested on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) within a period of 30 months.  The TRACER system is intended to have imaging capability that provides increased situational awareness by enabling long-range, wide area detection of targets under camouflage, concealment & deception (CC&D) conditions, and wide area mapping for complex env ironments.  TRACER will perform near real-time onboard image formation, change detection and possibly orthorectification.  The radar must have a flexible capability to notch on transmit to a depth of 30 dB for user-specified notch-widths larger than 25 KHz . TRACER will be capable of transmission of near real time imagery and data over Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) 45 Mbps Line of Sight (LOS) data link and/or over a 3.2 Mbps satellite link to the ground components. GFE change detection algorithms will b e available if requested. The radar has a primary band which must meet the sensitivity and resolution specifications in the table below.  In addition, the radar may have a secondary band which can be used in conjunction with the primary band to meet the target detection and other r equirements.  This secondary band need not meet the sensitivity or resolution specifications. For TRACER system performance parameters please visit the Army Single Face to Industry Website at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil/.  Under the Army PreAward section Login to CECOM - Market Research and view link entitled Tactical Reconnassance and Counter-c oncealment Enabled Radar (TRACER). Responders are requested to provide: 1.  A technical approach to meeting the above requirements for a TRACER system. Provide the parameter values that can be obtained above the threshold requirements. 2. Maturity of the payload (i.e., conceptual, developmental, production).  3. Cost/schedule requirements for design, development, integration, and test. No foreign nationals (NOFORN) need apply. Written inputs are requested within 30 days of announcement to Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate, Radar Application Branch, Bldg 600, Ft. Monmouth, NJ, 07703. Responses may also be submitted electronically to Point Of Contacts listed below. Responses shall be limited to no more than 15 pages in length.  This is not a request for proposal. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for any information solicited. Technical questions and r esponses should be addressed to Graydon Lutes 732-532-6110. POCs:    e-mail: Dorothy.Bartling@us.army.mil, or Graydon.Lutes@us.army.mil

<CONTACT>CATHY KALLISTROS, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3071
<DESC>The US Army and Navy currently use fixed loaded propellant for their 105mm artillery and tank ammunition.  The fixed ammunition requires a cartridge case to encase the propellant.  These cartridge cases are made by a series of deep draw metal-forming operations. 	The purpose of this market survey is to determine the feasibility of producing metallic cartridge cases through a process known as â€œflow formingâ€. Previous US Navy process development efforts have demonstrated the viability of using flow form metal-working as an alternative to deep drawing.  In an effort to expand the production base of these critical ammunition components, the Army is interested in evaluating the available flow form technologies and facilities for large caliber cartridge case manufacture. 	ARDEC is seeking companies / facilities within the United States &  Canada capable of flow forming large caliber (105mm) cartridge cases.  Specifically, we are looking for companies / facilities with experience flow  forming alloy steels and capable of handling cases that range from 3 inches to 5 inches in diameter, with overall lengths of up to 34 inches, and wall  thickness of less than 0.075 inches.  Responses to this survey should also  discuss the capabilities of heat treating these thin-walled components while  maintaining dimensional stability 	Interested parties should respond with: â€¢	Their flow forming capacity o	The size component they can handle o	Production rate for parts of this size â€¢	Their experience flow forming items similar to cartridge cases o	Right circular cylinders o	Internal diameter of 3 to 5 inches o	Overall length of 34 inches o	Wall thickness of less than 0.075 inches â€¢	Their available ancillary equipment relevant to cartridge case  production o	Heat treating equipment o	Finish machining equipment o	Coating equipment This survey is not a Solicitation, and should not be construed as such.  While  a Solicitation may be generated regarding flow forming of cartridge cases in  the future, no follow on activities are guaranteed.       Interested parties should respond by 28 April 2006 to ckallis@pica.army.mil.  No costs may be incurred as a result of this Market Survey.

<SUBJECT>28 -- Propulsion Commodity Council Virtual Industry Days
<DESC>The Propulsion Commodity Council, (Prop CC), located at the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center, Tinker AFB, OK will host Virtual Industry Days between 24 Mar 06 and 31 May 06.  The Virtual Industry Days event will be conducted electronically, with an opportunity for face-to-face meetings at the Lt Governor’s Oklahoma Aerospace Summit & Expo, 1-2 May 06.

The focus of the Virtual Industry Days event is the Propulsion Commodity Council’s Source Approval (SAR) Transformation.  The Prop CC launched its Group Source Approval initiative to meet the overall Commodity Council competitive strategy goals as follows: reduce total cost, reduce end-to-end cycle time and increase weapons system availability. The Group Source Approval initiative focuses on competitive spares acquisitions within the 2840 Federal Stock Class (FSC); the aircraft engine stationary turbine section components will serve as the pathfinder demonstrating the viability of the approach.  

The Group Source Approval Initiative

The current source approval process requires a manufacturer to submit a source approval package (SAR) for each part number they request approval.  The proposed approach allows grouping of similar parts across engine lines, and establishes a Process Matrix for each group.  

The Process Matrix lists each process spec/standard required to manufacture and inspect each part number and also describe tolerancing, major dimensions, and critical characteristics.  The populated Process Matrix is then used to propose the subject part numbers into groups with very similar process requirements.  Similarity is based on technical characteristics (geometry, materials, special processes) and required manufacturing and inspection processes.  

Manufacturers may then submit Group SARs addressing all of the part numbers in the technical group.  The USAF will evaluate Group SARs as a whole, and upon approval, issue an approval letter covering each part number in the technical group.  This will reduce the number of approval packages and reduce the administrative burden, costs and time for parts acquisition.

Group SAR Prototype – Turbine Stator Pathfinder

The Propulsion Commodity Council will prototype the Group SAR concept using Turbine Stator part numbers from the F100, F110, F101, F118, and TF39 engines.  Eleven groups of Turbine Stator parts (Groups A through PW) have been predefined (please see Turbine Stator Source Approval Groups attachment).  

The eleven Turbine Stator groups are not all-inclusive.  The US Air Force requests the industry propose additional Turbine Stator NSNs/part numbers for inclusion in Groups A-PW to 448msug.gbmop.propulsion@tinker.af.mil between 24 Mar 06 and 28 April 06.  The proposed NSNs/part numbers should be similar in function and required manufacturing and inspection processes as the group for which they are proposed, and be arranged in a Process Matrix (sample Process Matrix attached).  The USAF will consider the proposed NSNs/part numbers, and upon approval, add them to the existing Turbine Stator groups, or if warranted, create a new group.  The proposed NSNs/part numbers must be current configuration parts, competitively coded, and be managed by the USAF (not DLA) for this effort.  First priority for inclusion in a particular group will be given to NSNs/part numbers with the most active USAF usage.  All Turbine Stator NSN/part number proposals must be in by April 28, 2006 for the F100, F110, F101, F118, and TF39 engines.  

Final Turbine Stator Prototype groups are anticipated to be published by 5 May 2006 on Fed Biz Ops for public use.  The Oklahoma City Small Business Office will accept Turbine Stator Pathfinder Group SAR packages after 5 May 2006.  Please clearly mark your SAR with the words “Group SAR for Turbine Stator Pathfinder”.    

The Virtual Industry Days Timeline    

Part I – 24  Mar 06 to 28 Apr 06, Turbine Stator part number proposals submitted in Process Matrix Format to 448msug.gbmop.propulsion@tinker.af.mil
Part II – 1 and 2 May 06, Lt Governor’s Oklahoma Aerospace Summit & Expo

Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.

A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1)The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section. (d) Special rule for related partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) Warrants; (ii) Options; (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; (iv) Convertible debt instruments; (v) Others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JAN 2004), 52.212-2  EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.   Contract evaluation and process will be conducted under FAR Part 13.5 – Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Past Performance and Price, with past performance being somewhat more important than price. (1)  Past Performance Evaluation Standards: The offeror shall demonstrate Past Performance through completion of similar U.S. Navy contracts for same or similar installations.  The Contracting Officer may consider past performance experience with contracts that cover numerous other types of marine decking installation contracts.  Data submitted by the offeror other than relevant contracts may not be considered.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Failure to submit past performance information shall be considered certification (by signature on the proposal) that the contractor has no past performance for like or similar items for the Government to evaluate.  Offerors are required to provide information on no more than five (5) of the firm’s most recently completed U.S. Navy (not to exceed three years since completion) for like or similar services to those to be provided under this RFQ.  Offerors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.  Offerors who present similar contracts/orders should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of the solicitation.  
Offerors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance.  A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the proposal with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the proposals of other offerors having acceptable or better past performance.
Offerors are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry.  This information may include Contracting Officer’s knowledge and experience with contracts he or she has written, Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS), or past performance information from any source.  The information contained in offeror's Past Performance submittals will be evaluated by the PCO with the assistance of a Contract Specialist, if assigned.  The PCO will evaluate the offeror's Past Performance using the following sub-factors, which are of equal importance.
(a) Quality:  The offeror’s demonstrated history of delivering products and services of high quality and compliance with contractual requirements.  Quality will be evaluated in terms of: overall customer satisfaction, instances of rework and/or deficiency reports, and evidence of effective and/or innovative work applications that were beneficial to the customer.
(b)Timeliness: The offeror’s compliance with delivery and/or performance schedules, timeliness of submission of requested information, reports, and invoicing. 
(c) Contractor Responsiveness:  The offeror’s demonstrated ability to respond to customer concerns, isolate and resolve problems, and take systemic improvement action.
Each performance risk assessment of the factors listed above will consider:  the number, type, and severity of problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken and the overall work record.  
The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror’s performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information, therefore the adjectival ratings generally correlate with the definitions of performance risk as follows: 
Very Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the offeror will very successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets and exceeds contractual requirements to the Federal Government’s benefit.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.  This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA).
Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appears or were satisfactory. This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA).
Moderate Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions or the contractor’s proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. This equates to Acceptable (A).
High Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor’s corrective actions appear or were ineffective. This equates to Marginal (M).
Neutral:  No relevant past performance history, or for which past performance information is not provided or available.  Unknown performance risk assessment.  This equates to Neutral (N).
Under most circumstances, it will be unnecessary to divulge the solicitation number, or other identifying information to the reference.  In the event that it is necessary, you need to obtain a non-disclosure statement from the party to whom the information was provided.
The assessment of the offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offerors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFP.  In determining the rating of past performance evaluation factor, the Government will give greater consideration to the contracts which the Government determines are most relevant to the RFP. 
2.  Price:  The PCO will evaluate Price.  When the proposals are received, the PCO shall review the submission of offers as specified in FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors– Commercial Items (Jan 2005), paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(11).
The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose total offer is the most advantageous to the Government.  Offers must include prices for the CLIN listed.  Failure to do this may be cause for rejection of the offer for the CLIN listed.
The offeror’s proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.106-3.  The evaluation may include, but is not limited to: 
a)	Price comparison with other offerors; 
b)	Completeness:  All pricing information as it directly relates to the SOW; and
c)	Comparison with independent Government estimates.
Although price is the least most important evaluation factor, it has the potential to become more significant during the evaluation process.  The degree of importance of the price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factor on which selection is to be based.  The importance of price will also increase when a proposal's price is so significantly high as to diminish the value to the Government that might be gained under the other aspects of the offer.  If, at any stage of the evaluation, all offeror’s are determined to have submitted equal, or virtually equal, or generally equivalent, non-price proposals, price could become the factor in determining which offeror shall received the award.
3.  Best Value Determination.  The Government reserves the right to select an offeror with other than the best past performance, if the price is so advantageous to the Government as to constitute best value.  On the other hand, the Government may select an offeror with other than the lowest price if the quality of past performance and a fair and reasonable price of a competitor result in the greatest value to the Government.  Any such determination of best value will be made by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the evaluation criteria identified in this plan and the solicitation.
 (b) Options. N/A.
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

 Acceptance and Inspection Criteria

1.  Visual-Physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to specifications.
2.  Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications.  The tests will be performed as soon as the instrument is ready, as determined by the contractor, and may be witnessed by the contractor.  They will involve a total of 2 samples: one will be run to evaluate SPR spectroscopy and SPR imaging, the other will be run to evaluate SPR fluorescence spectroscopy and SPR fluorescence microscopy.  For each sample, the signal stability will be evaluated for 1 hour before adding the analyte, 1 hour after the adsorption reaches steady state, and 1 hour after rinsing back to pure buffer. 
3. The item must operate in 4 measurement modes: 1) SPR spectroscopy, 2) SPR imaging, 3) SPR fluorescence spectroscopy, 4) SPR fluorescence microscopy.  Modes 1) and 3) can be performed by integrating the total or partial image signal obtained from 2) and 4).  

1) SPR Spectroscopy:
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) reflectivity measurements are surface-sensitive, spectroscopic methods that can be used to characterize the thickness and/or index of refraction of ultrathin organic and biopolymer films at noble metal (Au, Ag, Cu) surfaces.  SPR spectroscopy can be characterized by three primary capabilities: (i) with SPR spectroscopy the kinetics of adsorption for organic molecules, biomolecules, or colloidal particles can be measured in real time, (ii) the adsorption of unlabeled analyte (no fluorescent or radiological tags) to the surface can be monitored, and (iii) SPR has a high degree of surface sensitivity that allows weakly bound interactions to be monitored in the presence of excess solution species (ability to perform classic Langmuir isotherm experiments).  Using samples we provide, the contractor should also be able to demonstrate (i) a noise floor of 0.54 microRIU = 0.40 RU = 0.000040 deg. (Raw Data RMS      Noise = 1.2 microRIU = 0.85 RU = 0.000085 deg), and (ii) baseline stability with a maximum drift of 5 microRIU/hour [1 microRIU = 0.73 RU = 0.000073 Deg] (iii) a maximum time resolution of at least 2 data points per second.

2) SPR Imaging:
SPR imaging is based on the same technical concept as SPR spectroscopy except the photodetector is replaced with a CCD camera.  The amount of adsorption is therefore measured as a function of position in two dimensions, allowing one to look at patterned substrates, or heterogeneous surfaces.  An important component of SPR imaging is the ability to convert the data, which is archived as a movie, into SPR spectroscopy plots by plotting the integrated signal from a user-selected area of the image as a function of time.
		
3) SPR Fluorescence Spectroscopy:
In contrast to SPR spectroscopy, SPR Fluorescence Spectroscopy does not measure the intensity of the light reflected from the back of the noble metal film.  Instead, the evanescent light wave that passes through the reflecting film is used to excite fluorescence from either quantum dots or fluorescent molecules in close proximity to the film.  The camera is therefore placed above the sample (same side as aqueous solution) rather than behind it.  The number of photons are then counted so that binding to the surface is monitored in terms of fluorescence intensity.  Once it is demonstrated that the CCD camera has an absolute proportionality between image signal and intensity, the total signal can then be calibrated with the SPR spectroscopy data, which is obtained simultaneously as described in 1), to measure the amount (thickness or mass) of the fluorescently-labeled material that has adsorbed to the surface.  The maximum time resolution should be at least 1 data point per second in order to monitor the kinetics of binding for both fluorescently-labeled and unlabeled material.

	4) SPR-Assisted Fluorescence Microscopy:
Except for the direction of the incoming light, the technique is very similar to conventional fluorescence microscopy.  It allows one to capture micrographs of the fluorescently-labeled material that is in close proximity to the noble metal film.  One can also capture movies with the CCD camera and convert the data into SPR Fluorescence Spectroscopy plots by plotting the integrated signal from a user-selected area of the image as a function of time.  In principle, one could inspect patterned surfaces or surfaces with chemistry gradients and collect SPR Fluorescence Spectroscopy plots from any part of the image.  This data is then compared with the SPR imaging signal to calibrate the data and to compare the kinetics of adsorption of fluorescently-labeled material with that of the unlabeled material.

<DESC>A.  Due to conference room scheduling complications, the pre quote conference date has been changed to April 10, 2006.  The location remains the following:  United States Patent and Trademark Office, Main Campus, 600 Dulany Street, Alexandria, Virginia, 22315.  USPTO will be conducting the conference in the Auditorium located in the concourse portion of the main campus.  The time is 1:00 PM - 4:00 PM.    

b.  Only small businesses that have requested a softcopy of the RFQ are permissible to attend.   Prospective contractors must submit a formal letter requesting participation and attendance for the conference.  The letter must be submitted as an attachment by email to richard.weibel@uspto.gov.  Industry participants are limited to two participants only.

C.  For those prospective contractors that have yet to receive a softcopy of the RFQ, I am screening the NAICS code stated in the original combined synopsis/solicitation notice.  If your organization does not have the NAICS code of 541511, "Custom Computer Program Services" listed in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) upon the date of my research, you are ineligible to participate.

<DESC>This amendment number 1 is issued to extend the response date from 3/24/2006 to on or before 1 PM (CST) 3/31/2006. This amendment also posts questions and answers; additional questions and answers will be posted at a later time.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:

1.  Please confirm requirement for satellite coverage to Alaska.  ANSWER: The coverage area for the equipment is North America, Alaska, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.

2.  Question IRT section II. Deliverables, 2. Network HUB – “Shall be a fixed installation at Fort Sam Houston”.  Will 3.8M antenna be roof or ground mount and how close to actual communication facility, (i.e. building)?  ANSWER: 3.8 dish should be mounted on roof and be able to be reposition.

3.  Requirements paragraph I. Overview – one sentence states “simultaneous uplink channel available bandwidth of 2Mbps from each of the two deployed terminals”.  Last sentence states “system configured for 2Mbps uplink and 3Mbps downlink”.  These sentences are inconsistent.  Please confirm last sentence should read 4Mbps uplink (two remotes x 2Mbps).  ANSWER:  The deployable systems need to be able to run at data rate of 2 meg uplink and 3 meg downlink.

4.  Please specify the required link availability; typical ku-band links have nominal availability of 99.5% at the worst case location (e.g. Florida).  ANSWER:  Do not understand what the question is.

5.  Technical question concerning number of max VoIP calls, II. Deliverables, 1. System -  (DTech WHISPER900 capable of 120 calls with max input i.e. 4 E1s).  Please provide max number based on current link requirement, (2MB uplink) of remote terminals, hub. ANSWER:  Around 24.

6.  Where will the antenna be installed? (roof top, concrete pad, building number, etc.)  ANSWER:  Roof top.

7. What is the distance from the antenna to the network?  ANSWER:  Approx 200 ft.

8. Will trenching be required? ANSWER:  No.

9. Will conduit be required? ANSWER:  No.

10. Will the racks for the Hub configuration be GFE? ANSWER:  Yes.

11. Can you please clarify the satellite foot print coverage area.  In the document it states coverage area needs to be North America, Alaska, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.  I do not know of any satellite that has coverage over that entire area.  We could do it with multiple satellites if it is a necessity or look at using one satellite over another based on the contour maps.  The satellite we are looking at for this has coverage in most of N. America stretching into Canada, but does not cover the northern reaches of the Canadian Territories, Puerto Rico the Virgin Islands yet has coverage in Hawaii.  Another satellite has coverage further in the Caribbean. Will this be an issue for your customer, can they please provide additional direction?  Can they be more specific to the coverage areas in the most northern areas of North America?  ANSWER:  Coverage area is as stated.

12. In Section 4 Delivery Schedule, it asks that testing of the equipment be performed at Vendors facilities.  This is very easily done with the 2 portable earth stations, however, can you please clarify if they would like us to install, set up, and test the Network Hub as well.  Yes.

13. Section II #2 Network Hub – Does your customer want the 3.8m dish to be stearable or fixed?  If it is fixed and they want to use a different satellite for communications at a later date, there is no way to move the dish to a different orbital location.  If it is stearable there would be some sort of manual interface to redirect the dish to another location.  ANSWER:  Stearable is fine.

14. SCPC in its pure form is not a shared bandwidth capable at the RF link level for simultaneous operation without another type of RF access scheme.  Would you please clarify if the links from the remotes are 2mbps each with simultaneous operation? Additionally, the requirement for a total (shared) downlink capability of 3MBps from the fixed central hub cannot be accomplished unless it is a TDM solution; or did the requirement mean to state that each remote would receive at 1.5mbps each with a total aggregate requirement (for both links combined) to be 3.0mbps?  ANSWER:  2MBps up, 3BMps down for each terminal, central hub to support these requirements.

15. Have questions been posed and responded to in a public means? If so, where are those located?  ANSWER:  Questions and answers will be posted in FedBizOpps.

Specifically how long will be the wait for approval from VOA before material not included in the delivered package and/or additional b-roll be repurposed to other entities?  A62.  Upon submission of the finished product, VOA will approve within 24 hours.  Once VOA has officially accepted the package, the Contractor is free to repurpose to other entities, the material not included in the delivered package.  Q63. For submission with the proposal, what format does VOA want the work samples on? A63. Beta SP.  Q64. Can you elaborate on the specific information you want included from at least three (3) international news organizations that currently use TV material on a regular basis. Do you want the organizations to provide a written reference for the contractor?  A65. The RFP requires the offeror to provide 3 references along with their contact information.  If you would like, you may also provide a written reference from the news organization, but it is not required.  Q65. In reference to the above questions, how do you define “regular basis?”  A65. At least once a month.  Q66. Other than name, contact name, address, telephone and fax number, e-mail address, what are the specifics on the “other relevant information” VOA requires?  A66. “Other relevant information” is whatever else the offeror’s wishes to provide in their proposal regarding their relationship with the news organization.  Q67.If a contractor has low qualifications and a low price vs. high qualifications and a higher price, how will VOA specifically determine who receives the award?  A67.  Refer to Section (ix) of the RFP. Q68. If qualifications are equal, and a contractor bids high on the packages from 1:30 to 2:30 in length, and low on packages from 2:30 to 4:00 minutes in length (or vice-versa), what will determine who gets the contract?  A68.  As stated in the RFP, “The Government will award a contract…to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.”  Q69. Can you specifically define the criteria for “sound journalism experience?”  A69.  See A1 above.  Q70. Will the 5 to 6 submitted samples be the only contact VOA has with the contractor before awarding the contract?  A70.  See A31.  Q71. Will the 5 to 6 submitted samples be the main criteria used in determining if the selected contractor has “sound journalism experience?”  A71. See evaluation criteria, RFP Section (ix).  Q72. Given that the contract period is for 5 years, and technology for news gathering, news production and transmission and distribution is changing at a rapid pace, can VOA provide any strategic plans for dealing with changing technology in the next 5 years and how that will affect this contract?  A72. VOA presently has no strategic plan to deal with this issue.  Q73. Will any provisions be made to alter the contract, if technology requires changes, and how will that be addressed?  A73.  There is no provision for technology changes for delivery of stories.  Q74. Will there be a requirement for the contractor to produce packages in high definition?  A74. No.  Q75. If there is a requirement for the contractor to produce stories in HD, how will the additional cost for HD production be accounted for? A75.  There is no requirement for HD.  Q76. Can you explain what ) in his proposed firm-fixed price for the story.  The VOA will consider all proposed prices in arriving at an award decision.  Q11.  If VOA is currently procuring package production from outside vendors, what fees are they currently charging per package?  A11.  See A10 above.  Q12. Does that fee include travel and other out of pocket costs including transmission, overnight mail, etc?  A12. Yes.  Q13. What is the guideline for the number of shooting days expected for each 1:30 to 2:30 minute package and for each 2:30 to 4:00 minute package?  A13. There is no set guideline. It would depend on the story.  Q14. What is the guideline for the number of editing hours expected for each 1:30 to 2:30 minute package and for each 2:30 to 4:00 minute package?  A14. See A13 above.  Q15. Can VOA provide further guidance on the type and amount of travel expected?  A15. No.  Q16. Without more specifics on expected travel, how should contractors account for different per diem costs when the per diem for Dearborn is very different than the per diem for Paris?  A16. See A1 above.  Q17. Who will determine the level of travel required for the contract?  A17. VOA and the Contractor will reach mutual agreement.  Q18. What happens if VOA requests a story from a location that the contractor feels is cost-prohibitive to travel to? A18. The Contractor may elect to not produce the story.  Q19. Will any provisions be made for VOA to reimburse travel costs, if they request a story from a location that requires a high cost of travel?  A19. No.  Q20. What happens if the contractor and VOA cannot “mutually” determine or agree upon a minimum of 10 stories per month?  A20.  In the event the Contractor and VOA cannot mutually agree on a minimum of 10 stories per month, the Contractor will be reimbursed only for the number of stories that are accepted by the VOA.  Q21. How many “rejections” per month does the contractor have?  A21.  There is no set number of “rejections” per month.  Q22. If VOA and the contractor can't agree on ten stories a month, will the contractor still get paid for that minimum anyway?  Or does it carry over to following months?  A22.  See A20 above.  Q23. What happens if the contractor and VOA cannot agree on a delivery method for an agreed upon    package?  A23.  VOA may not procure the package.  Q24. Is there any fixed percentage of areas that stories will come from, i.e. ten percent technology, ten percent health? Also, there didn’t seem to be any stories about social issues, democracy, capitalism, environment, etc.  A24. No.  Q25. What are the specific criteria for determining when it is acceptable for VOA to fill limited video gaps with file or news feed video?  A25. There are no specific criteria available for the above.  Q26. How do you define “limited video gaps” as referenced in the Workflow section of the RFP?  A26. Small less than 15 seconds. Q27.  If contractor has access to news feeds, and VOA has rights to those feeds, can contractor use that video for the packages, at the contractor’s discretion?  A27. Yes, but the majority of any report should be original to that specific report.  Q28. What news feeds does VOA have the rights to?  A28.  APTN, ABC Newsone.  Q29.  If VOA does not use the material provided by the contractor, how long before the contractor can offer that material to other outlets?  A29.  Immediately.  Q30. What will determine the number of packages submitted (10 to 60) each month?  A30. The news and the number that can be mutually agreed upon.  Q31. Can you define and specify the “contracting by negotiation procedures?”  A31.  After receipt of proposals, there may be discussions between VOA and offerors who have reasonable chance of award.  These offerors may be asked to submit Final Proposal Revisions.  This process is called negotiations.  Q32. Who will determine what is the best length for a package and what specific criteria will be used?  A32. It will be mutually agreed upon.  Q33. What happens if the contractor and the ARCO disagree on the acceptable length for a package?  A33. If it can’t be mutually agreed to we won’t produce the report.  Q34. Do you anticipate most stories to be character driven?  A34. When appropriate.  Q35. Is there a requirement for each package to have at least one interview?  A35. The reports should be accurate, comprehensive, balanced and journalistically sound. To achieve that, normally would require at least one, if not more, interviews.  Q36. Does the person being interviewed have to be approved by the ARCO before the contractor can proceed to book the interview?  A36.  No.  Q37.  Can VOA provide specific guidelines on the elements they expect to be included in each package?  A37. The elements would be dictated by the story.  See A35 above.  Q38. Does VOA require a transcript of the interviews?  A38  As stated in the RFP, we require a full script of the story.  Q39.Does VOA require a copy of the entire raw footage of the interview?  A39.  No.  Q40. Does VOA require a copy of the raw footage shot for each story?  A40. No.  Q41. Can contractors use footage from APTN or Newsource, which already provide footage to VOA?  A41. Yes as long as it makes up only a small part of the story.  Q42. In suggesting stories, do the stories have to be usable by all of the VOA services, or just by some?   A42.  The stories do not have to be usable by all of the VOA services.  Q43. Will some stories be used by only one Service, i.e. Persian? How many?  A43. No.  There is no set number of stories for each service.  The stories will be used based on news events at VOA’s discretion.  Q44. Are there a minimum number of services that have to be interested in a story before it is approved by the ARCO?  A44. No.  Q45. If the packages are utilized by Al Hurra or TV Marti, is the contractor paid an additional fee? How much?  A45.  If this happens, the amount of any additional fee would be negotiated between the Contractor and Al Hurra or TV Marti.  Q46. If the audio from a package is used by VOA radio, does the contractor receive an additional fee? How much?  A46.  No.  Q47. If VOA offers the packages to affiliates outside of VOA/IBB, will contractor receive an additional fee?  A47. No.  Q48. If the contractor scores an “exclusive” interview or “exclusive” footage, will VOA distribute that footage and interview to other news outlets with whom they don’t have contracts, i.e. Fox, BBC, NBC, etc.?  A48. VOA is restricted from distributing to US domestic broadcasters.  Q49. When the package is assigned, who makes the determination of the length of the package? A49. Mutual determination at the time of the assignment. Q50.  Does VOA plan to stream the packages on their web site? Do they require exclusivity for that?  A50. We may stream on occasion but exclusivity is not required.  Q51. How long does it take for a package to be accepted?  A. See RFP Section (vi) Subsection entitled, “Workflow.” Q52. Is the ARCO the sole determinant of acceptability?  A52. Yes.  Q53. Is there an appeal?  A53. No.  Q54. Who replaces the ARCO during vacations, retirement, sick days, etc?  A54. A backup, to be determined, will be designated and the Contractor will be notified.  Q55. How long must the contractor wait before selling a rejected story elsewhere?  A55.  There is no waiting period for rejected stories.  Q56. Can packages be done in a series, i.e. more than one package on a theme?  A56. We would consider a series.  Q57. Does VOA require any specific information on the reporters and producers who will be filing stories?  A57. No.  Q58. Can VOA specifically define their expected professional and journalistic standards?  A58.  See A1 above.  Q59. Specifically how will it be determined, what are the specific criteria and who will mediate if VOA wants to cancel a story, but the contractor has already spent time working on the story?  A59.  If a story is cancelled, the Contractor will be paid for costs incurred up to the point of cancellation. Q60. Will VOA give written specifics about what content is expected for each story, so there are no guidelines to refer to if VOA determines “the content of the story is not what was promised.”  A60.  See A1 above.    
Please be mindful that the last day for questions was March 7, 2006.  Proposals are due at the Broadcasting Board of Governors, Office of Contracts, ATTN: Marlene Brooks, 330 C Street, SW, Room 2527, Washington, DC 20237 on Monday, April 10, 2006 at 2:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time.

<DESC>Amendment No. 2 is issued to: 1) extend the deadline for receipt of proposals to 2:00pm, EST, Monday, April 10, 2006, and 2) provide the answers to questions that were received in response to Solicitation No. BBGCON3406S5855.  Please be advised that 115 questions were received in response to our requirement.  Amendment No. 2 provides answers to the first sixty (60) questions, and Amendment No. 3 provides answers to the remaining fifty-five (55) questions.  Question (Q) 1. In the interest of providing the best value to the Government and avoiding possible future conflicts, can VOA provide much more specific information regarding the expectations and requirements for this contract?  Particularly in regards to travel and journalistic expectations, there are a lot of issues that are not directly addressed in this RFP.  Answer (A) 1.  BBG believes it has provided all necessary information for this requirement.  The Contractor is responsible for the development of all packages.  VOA expects all stories to be accurate, comprehensive, balanced and journalistically sound. VOA will not pay travel costs.  Q2.  10 to 60 packages is a very broad number and leaves open innumerable questions regarding expectations and execution.  It will be difficult for a contractor to determine how to truly provide the best value to the government, so can you provide more specific information regarding the specifics of the packages and content VOA is seeking, and the journalistic approach for those stories?  A2. No, VOA cannot provide any additional information.  Refer to A1 above.  Q3.  In order for the contractor to specify the number of TV reports they are capable of delivering each month, can VOA provide much more specifics on the types of stories, areas they want covered, what will determine the number of packages required each month, geographic areas most interested in and any other specific information to help contractor determine VOA’s requirements? A3.  No, additional information will be provided, except to refer to the solicitation.  Q4.  Does VOA currently have a set budget for a set # of packages?  For instance, if contractor can provide 60 packages/month at the outset of the contract, does VOA have an available budget to purchase that # of stories each month, beginning with the award of the contract?  A4.  VOA has a budget for the requirement in the solicitation.  Q5. Can VOA provide guidance on if there is a budget timeline for increasing the number of packages produced each month?  A5. See A4 above.  Q6. Does VOA currently procure packages from outside sources?  A6.  Yes.   Q7.Is anyone currently providing similar services to VOA or any of its language services either under contract or on an ad hoc basis?  A7. Yes, on an ad hoc basis only.  Q8. The RFP has a lot of references to a “mutual” consent and agreement between the contractor and VOA.  Are there plans for VOA to personally interview contractors, before awarding the contract, to ensure VOA and the contractor have the same philosophy and approach to news production?  A8.  This requirement does allow for discussions and submission of Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs).  However, the closing date is not until April 10, 2006.  Thus, it is easy to determine whether any of the above will be used. We have to wait and see the responses before we can determine if a meeting is required.  Q9. If VOA does currently procure similar services and/or packages as described in the RFP, will that company be given preference on this contract?  A9. This is a new requirement.  However, similar Packages have been procured on an ad hoc basis from various companies.  No firm will be given preference in this competition.  Q10. If so, does VOA have a rate card, standard price or any guidance on the price range it typically pays for outside produced stories?  A10.  The rate for each story is normally established by negotiating price within an existing range. The Offeror must include ALL of their costs (travel, etc.it means for an award to “be made without discussions (negotiations?)”  And how does that affect/differ the earlier statement in the RFP that a “single contract will be awarded using the contracting by negotiation procedures.”  A76.   All offerors are encouraged to submit their best proposals because one proposal may be selected as being most advantageous to the Government and selected for contract award without going back to all offerors for contract submission.  Q77.  What will be the determining factor or factors if an award is “made without discussions (negotiations?).”  A77.   See RFP Section (ix).  Q78.How should proposals be submitted?  Is an email acceptable?  A78.  Proposals should be made via surface delivery to the mailing address provided in the RFP.  Submission by email is not acceptable.  Q79. Do the reporters used for packages have to have on-air experience?  A79. No.  The English track is for reference only and will never air. Q80. Can the reporters appear on any outlets, or are they exclusively for the use of VOA?  A80. We do not want a reporter on camera, so therefore we do not require any exclusivity.  Q81. Is there a prohibition for reporters to appear on other news outlets as commentators?  A81. No.  Q82.Are they any contingencies for either party to cancel the contract?  A82.  Yes, there are provisions for the Government to terminate for convenience.  Q83.  In the section entitled “WORKFLOW”, solicitation states: “Once VOA approves the story idea, VOA is obligated to pay for the package even if it is not used, unless.....the content of the story is not what was promised”.  Question: Who will determine whether the content is not as promised, and in the event that the Contractor disagrees with that finding, what arbitration procedure will follow?  A83. The Parties would work together to reach a mutual resolution on the issue. Q84.  In the solicitation section entitled “CONDITIONS: VOA”, item h) reads: “...VOA will have the right to offer the TV packages to affiliates outside of VOA/IBB”.  Questions: a) Will VOA furnish the Contractor with a list of existing affiliates outside of VOA/IBB? b) Will VOA agree to seek the Contractor's consent before new affiliates are offered the TV packages, in order to avoid providing material to networks already served by the Contractor, or to networks competitive with the Contractor's existing clients?  A84. No to both questions.  Q85. Does VOA have a start-date in mind for the commencement of supply under this solicitation?  A85. As soon as possible after contract award.  Q86. Confirm that pricing for each segment (based on duration) needs to factor in travel, per diem, accommodations, and sustenance.  A86. Correct.  Q87. How has Item #1 been done in the past for other contracts where it is unclear where services will emanate from (domestic vs. international)?  A87. This is a new requirement.  See A9 above. Q88. Can a variety of on-camera talent be used or is the VOA looking for the same reporter?  A88.  The Contractor must not put talent on camera, but a variety of reporters off-camera is fine.  Q89. Confirm all B-roll is to be provided by the contractor.  Does this have to be taped by the contractor or can be coordinated by acquiring footage from local media agencies for example?  A89. All b-rolls do not have to be shot by the Contractor. Q90. Confirm all tape stock and transmission services (internet, satellite, etc.) are the responsibility of the Contractor.  A90.  Correct.  Q91. Would any stories be accepted in via a non-live or instantaneous delivery system such as mailing or  express servicing videotapes? A91. Yes.  Q92. Does the contractor need to provide any translator services at all or is English the only language needed on the stories? A92. See Section (vi) of the RFP.  Q93.  Will the contract be awarded to one contractor or could several contractors be retained to provide this service to VOA?  A93.  As stated in the RFP, the resultant contract will be awarded to one (1) contractor.  Q94.  What television news services does the BBG have broadcast rights to that can be used in the Packaged Television News/Feature Reports, i.e. CBS, ABC, NBC, APTN, Reuters?  A94. See A28 above.  Q95.  Questions about travel expenses:  because travel is distance sensitive and varies from city to city, are travel expenses to be included and somehow averaged into the CLIN items?  Or will travel be negotiated on a case-by-case basis as stories are pitched and accepted by the BBG?  A95. Travel must be included and averaged into the CLIN item.  Q96.  The solicitation states “The contractor is responsible for all travel and transmission costs incurred to produce and submit a finished Packaged TV Report.”  I interpret this to mean that the contractor is responsible for all normal travel costs within the normal commuting area where the contractor has personnel and this cost is part of the cost for a Packaged TV Report. The reason for this interpretation is that, under FAR regulation 31.205-46, the government is responsible for expenses incurred separately. For example, if by mutual agreement there is a story to be produced in a small town in the United States or an out of the way foreign location beyond where we have established offices, we presume that FAR regulations apply.  A96.  For this requirement, travel costs are not reimbursable.  Travel and all items required to produce stories are factored into the price of each story.  Q97.  In the original solicitation (Number BBGCON3606S5797), the VOA had sized task requirements by intending to award multiple BPAs to industry to satisfy future work.  However, in the new solicitation the task requirements remain at the earlier levels but the wording indicates just one award to be made.  If this is correct, we would like the VOA to explain the sudden change in intension to make just one award.  If the VOA decides to stick to its decision of making just one award, it raises addition questions.  a)  In a government contracting culture that continues to embrace awarding multiple awards as a means to attract the best prices and talent, why would the VOA want to keep out other deserving small businesses for a long period of time by awarding just one contract when empirical evidence suggests it could do otherwise? b) Has a company emerged with whom the VOA has had communication with or business with prior to the release of this new solicitation that has potentially helped the VOA conclude that a single contractor is optimal?  A97.  VOA has only a requirement for a single Contractor.  Q98. Clause (ii) states, “… a single contract will be awarded using the contracting by negotiation procedures. “ while, Clause (x) states, “…Offerors are encouraged to submit their best technical and price offer initially, because an award may be made without discussions (negotiations).” Is “(x)” the prevailing or expected procedure? A98.  See A76 above.  Q99. As this is a new venture for VOA, is the mission statement of Voice of America a good guide for the forthcoming News Reports? A99. Yes.  Q100. Are the current VOA website video streams examples of the expected work?  A100. A difficult question. We stream a great many videos and I don’t really know what videos you are referring to so I don’t really have an answer for you.  Q101. (vi) STATEMENT OF WORK: REQUIREMENT: a) Who will supply the templates and file various legal forms; i.e., release forms or announcer union reports?  Who will supply the lead-in music? VOA or the Contractor?  A101.  If you are talking about a script template, VOA will supply that. A paperwork related to the report will be the Contractor’s responsibility. VOA does not want music on any of these reports.  Q102. WORKFLOW: Do you anticipate using any aspect ratio besides 4:3 or using HD? A102. No.
Q103. Could you please give some examples of training as stated under:  “CONDITIONS: VOA (i) VOA can provide training for Contractor’s personnel, if necessary, on minor aspects of script or video delivery.” and “CONDITIONS: contractor (h) Contractor can provide training for VOA personnel, if necessary, on minor aspects of script or video delivery. “ A103. It could be showing the vendor how to file the script or video via MPEG 2.  Q104. (vii) PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Do you have an anticipated schedule to begin broadcasts or when the first packages will be due?  A104. No.  Q105. Considering Clause (x), “…two (2) copies of technical, and two (2) copies of the price proposal, bound separately.” Should the technical and price proposals, other support print materials and references be bound together as one (1) and then, (2) copies (each containing everything) be made of this packet?  A105.  The technical section of your proposal should separate and bound from your cost section which should also be bound.  Both sections should be submitted as a complete proposal packet.  Thus, (1) complete original proposal packet and (1) complete copy of the proposal packet.  Q106.  What are the locations for shooting these 1:30-4 minute productions?  A106. They could be shot nearly anywhere.  Q107.  Should the proposal incorporate all production costs including actors?   A107.   Yes.  Q108.  Is the proposal ideally including basic breakdowns of production charges?  I’m just unclear as to how flexible our proposal should be because the post notes that travel costs cannot be added.  A108. Breakdown of pricing is not required. We want a price per story, inclusive of all costs.  Q109.  Provide a list of items, schedules of requirements, scope of work, terms of reference, bill of materials required.  A109.  The RFP, as posted on the FBO website, contains all necessary information for this requirement.  Q110.  Provide soft copy of the tender document through email.  A110.  See A109 above.  Q111.  Provide names of countries that will be eligible to participate in this tender.  A111.  N/A.  Q112.  Provide information about the tendering procedures and guidelines.  A112.  See A109 above.  Q113.  Provide estimated budget for this purchase. A113.  No.  Q114.  Will there be any extension of bidding deadline?  A114.  Yes, the deadline for receipt of proposals has been extended.  See top of this notice for the date.  Q115.  Will there be any addendums or Pre-Bid meeting minutes?  A115.  No.    Please be mindful that the last day for questions was March 7, 2006.  Proposals are due at the Broadcasting Board of Governors, Office of Contracts, ATTN: Marlene Brooks, 330 C Street, SW, Room 2527, Washington, DC 20237 on Monday, April 10, 2006 at 2:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time.
