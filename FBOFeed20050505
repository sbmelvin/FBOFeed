<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences intends to award a sole source purchase order to Affymetrix, Sunnyvale, CA 94086, pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)-Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This procurement is for Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array; Kit One-cycle target labeling and control reagents;  Kit, Two-cycle target labeling and control reagents. With the One-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents, the NIEHS NCT Microarray Group will be able to perform a single round amplification from 1ìg Total RNA for use on Affymertix Eukaryotic GeneChip™ Arrays.  Based on discussions with multiple sales representatives from various companies and internet searches there is no other package on the market that combines all reagents necessary for performing labeling and hybridization for Affymetrix Eukaryotic GeneChip™ Arrays with the spike-in control targets.  By purchasing this all-in-one kit from Affymetrix quality control, lot variation, and expiration of reagents are all controlled yielding higher quality data for the NCT. 
With the Two-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents, the NIEHS NCT Microarray Group will be able to perform a double round amplification from 10çg Total RNA for use on Affymertix Eukaryotic GeneChip™ Arrays.  This low amount of starting material is ideal for Laser Capture Microdiscetion studies that are ongoing at NIEHS.  Based on discussions with multiple sales representatives from various companies and internet searches there is no other package on the market that combines all reagents necessary for performing labeling and hybridization for Affymetrix Eukaryotic GeneChip™ Arrays with the spike-in control targets.  Each kit contains 1 each of: IVT labeling kit, Two-cycle cDNA synthesis kit, Sample clean-up module, Poly-A RNA Control Kit & Hybridization Controls.  By purchasing this all-in-one kit from Affymetrix quality control, lot variation, and expiration of reagents are all controlled yielding higher quality data for the NCT. 
The Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array is 30 packs of GeneChip™ Arrays for covering the entire mouse genome.  These arrays are the only arrays that can be used in the Affymetrix GeneChip™ system (consisting of hybridization oven, fluidics station, and laser scanner).  Affymetrix high-density probe arrays can offer oligo densities as high as 106 per cm2.  This high density feature is unique to Affymetrix and covered by patents, USP Nos. 5,445,934 and 5,744,305 as well as others.  Typically, Affymetrix produces arrays with over 1,000,000 probe locations, or features, within 1.28 square centimeters.  Each individual feature harbors millions of DNA molecules.  High probe density allows for the generation of a maximum amount of robust data with a single microarray.  This minimizes sample requirements and simplifies prep work and data analysis.  Also, Affymetrix’s photolithographic manufacturing technology enables consistent reproduction of probe array designs and reduces variation inherent in less sophisticated array manufacturing technologies.  This feature is unique to Affymetrix and covered by patents USP Nos. 5,424,186 and 5,510,270 as well as others. The NIEHS NCT currently has an Affymetrix system and by patents only Affymetrix GeneChips  can be used with the system.  The one and two cycle labeling kits have been used in NIEHS for two years now and using other labeling technologies would compromise ongoing experiments and compromise the integrity of data flowing into the CEBS database.
All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of date of notice to Elaine Shoaf at the above address for consideration by the agency.  Faxed responses will be accepted at 919 541-5117.   Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Affymetrix.

This contract is restricted and limited to only those firms (1) having an existing primary corporate general construction contracting office as of the date of this announcement within a 200-mile radius of Cape Girardeau, Missouri's city limits; (2) meeting the minimum requirement of having worked on a similar or partially similar project – defined as a new construction interior office or other projects with a high level of interior finishes and complexity.  

The project is the third phase in the construction of a new U.S. Courthouse in Cape Girardeau, Missouri.  The purpose of this phase is to construct approximately 100,000 gross square feet of tenant space inside the newly constructed courthouse core and shell.  Estimated award range is between $8,000,000 and $11,000,000.  Award and Partial Notice to Proceed is anticipated in September 2005.  After receipt of Partial Notice to Proceed, the contractor is expected to prepare and submit shop drawings and order/fabricate long lead items.  The construction completion time is eight months after receipt of Full Notice to Proceed, which is expected to be issued in January 2006.  Full Notice to Proceed may be delayed, pending completion of the core and shell work.

Areas to be constructed include:  courtrooms, judges chambers, U.S. Marshals’ holding cells and sallyport, and general office space for associated courts functions.  Base work includes the construction of walls, ceilings, access floor, floor finishes, lighting, HVAC distribution, security devices, life safety equipment, etc.  Option prices will be broken out by each tenant area, as defined in the construction drawings.  LEED certification (silver) is specified for this project.  Successful contractor will be required to maintain and assemble records for this phase of the project, and compile records to be maintained by the LEED consultant of Phase II.  

A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held in Cape Girardeau on or about June 2, 2005.  Specific time and location will be specified in the Request For Proposal (RFP), issued on or about May 20, 2005.  Receipt of Technical Proposals will be on or about June 21, 2005.  Price Proposals will be received on or about July 7, 2005.  

The RFP will contain the construction drawings and specifications, the solicitation provisions (including FAR clauses); the proposal submittal requirements and the evaluation factors.  

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures, resulting in a firm-fixed price contract.  The Government intends to use the “trade-off” process in selecting the prime contractor.  The “trade-off process” is a method of evaluating both the technical factors specified in the solicitation and the price proposal.  For this solicitation, the goal is to select the proposal that offers the best combination of technical qualifications and price.  The Government intends to award the contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, with technical evaluation factors being considered more significant than cost or price.  The object is to select the proposal that offers the best value, not necessarily to select the contractor with the lowest price.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  

GSA will evaluate all proposals.  The evaluation team will comply with the GSA Source Selection Policy with respect to nondisclosure, conflict of interest, safeguarding of data and any other regulatory or statutory requirement therein stated or referenced.  Contract award will be contingent upon funds availability.

Proposals will be evaluated in two stages.  Stage One, Request for Technical Proposals (RFTP) will be issued on or about May 20, 2005.  Technical proposals shall not include prices or pricing information.  In Stage One, the Government will evaluate the proposals and rank them in accordance with their technical qualifications.  Technical evaluation factors, in order of importance are:  1) Past Performance of the Firm; 2) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel; 3) Management Plan; and 4) Sustainable Construction Practices, Materials and Methods.  Offerors whose proposals are not considered to be viable for award will be notified and may submit a price proposal if they so choose.  Offerors whose proposals do not meet minimum requirements will be notified and will not be allowed to submit a price proposal.  

Stage Two will cover the evaluation of price proposals.  Price proposals will be received on or about July 7, 2005.   Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional information, as the Government may make the final determination regarding a proposal’s acceptability based solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted and may award without discussions.  If discussions with offerors are conducted, the Government will request final proposal revisions.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price then becomes more important.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the combination of technical qualifications and cost or price that is most advantageous to the Government. 

Prior to award of a contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and GSA approval of the subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide maximum practicable opportunities for small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by women-owned small businesses.

This proposed procurement is not set aside for small business.  All responsible sources not limited by the restrictions stated in the first paragraph may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.  Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.  FAR Clause 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply.

Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  At minimum, all vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov) and must supply the following information: 

1.	Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) which you should obtain from your Company CCR Point of Contact,

3.	Your Company Tax ID Number, 
4.	Your Telephone Number, and

In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS).  GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Procurement Services Branch (6PCA), will no longer mail hardcopies of solicitations and amendments.  The solicitation (specifications) and its amendments will only be available through a link in www.fedbizopps.gov to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.  Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires current registration in CCR as a prerequisite.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (http://www.ccr.gov) and then with FEDTeDS (http://www.fedteds.gov).  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, procurement information will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry (www.fedbizopps.gov) but the sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information (specifications) will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.  Offerors are responsible for producing their own print sets for their own use.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Headquarters Procurement Division intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with FLIR Systems, Inc., (FSI), Boston, 25 Esquire Road, North Billerica, MA 01862, for Repair Services to six Maritime Forward Looking Infrared (MARFLIR) Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) at an estimated cost not to exceed $100,000.00.  The basis for the sole source is that obtaining other than FSI's services for repair of the MARFLIR is not possible due to a lack of rights in technical data. In 1989, the Government awarded competitive contract nos. N00164-98-D-0037 and N00164-98-D-0039.  No technical data rights (other than Government Purpose Rights) were obtained due to the commercial nature of the items. The Government does not have any mechanical and electrical drawings, information on internal software and interface control documents to provide to another company.  Based on this, the repair services for MARFLIR units must be obtained from FSI.  Based on this the repair services for the six MARFLIR LRUs must be obtained from FSI. Responses to this synopsis must be submitted no later than 12 May 2005. Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted via email to Val Romanchek at romancv@socom.mil, (813) 828-7335.

<DESC>THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE.  The U.S. Coast Guard intends to release an RFP to fulfill the need for customized Dive Trailers. The purpose of the Dive Trailer is to provide a single, transportable unit capable of fully supporting all aspects of the diving operations. The trailer must also serve as a self-contained Diving Locker for all operations. The following is a summary of the draft requirements:  The trailer should be designed to fit and be secured inside a C-130 aircraft and be towed by a Ford E-350 fifteen passenger van (maximum towing capacity of 9,000lbs; estimated cargo weight 4,000lbs). Maximum dimensions are 252 inches long by 104 inches wide by 96 inches high. All the equipment inside the trailer must be capable of being sufficiently stabilized and secured for air travel. Due to the inherently wet environment the trailer will be used in, all materials should be non-corrosive. Flooring should be durable and water resistant. The floor should have adequate anchor points to tie additional equipment down with standard cargo straps during transport.  Interior walls should be coated with vinyl or some other water resistant coating. The interior of the side door should be surfaced with a dry erase board as large as possible. A generator is needed to provide adequate interior and exterior lighting and a heating and air conditioning capability. The generator should be mounted externally to optimize internal capacity. Due to the wet environment the trailer will be used in, all electrical outlets must be protected by a ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI). Wherever possible (awning, stabilizer jacks, etc.) electric systems should be used instead of manual systems. An environmental control system is required to enable all weather operations and maintain a dry atmosphere in the trailer. The charging station requires sufficient electrical outlets to charge six devices. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The request information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. We anticipate posting the RFP within the month of March.  Please reference Reference-Number-HSCG23-05-R-TRAILER!!

The altitude of the environment where the boot will be used for operations is from 0 to 16,000 feet of elevation.  The boot is expected to perform on varying degrees of slope from 0 to 90 degrees, and on a wide variety of terrain types to include but not limited to rock, loose soil, mud, snow, alpine ice and scree or talus.  The boot shall maintain durability and provide good traction for maneuverability in the above environments and terrain.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA intends to procure Inertial Measurement Units (IMU's) on a competitive Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity, Firm Fixed Price basis.  The anticipated minimum quantity is 10 with a maximum quantity of 150.  It is anticipated that the ordering period will be for three years from date of award.  Delivery of all units is FOB destination to the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division China Lake, CA.  The procurement is in support of a test demonstration for the Low Cost Guided Imaging Rocket (LOGIR) system.  Specifications:  The IMUs to be purchased shall fit in  2.55 inch diameter by 1.5 inch long cylinder.  The IMU will be mounted in a 2.75 inch diameter (outer) rocket with a wall thickness of  .075 inch. The IMU's shall measure 3 axes of inertial angular rates and acceleration (specific force) in a body mounted strap down configuration.  The IMU shall provide compensated summed or incremental ang! le and velocity data to be used for navigation as well as angular rates and acceleration useful for flight control purposes.  The compensation shall be performed over the operational temperature range and for operational acceleration limits.  The IMU should be fully functional in less than 1 second after power up.  The weight of the IMU shall be less than 0.5 pounds.  One end of the cylinder shape shall contain an attachment or mounting structure suitable for the maximum input accelerations and the other end should have the electrical connector.  The mounting structure shall be capable of mounting the IMU to a bulkhead plate.  The attachment structure or connector shall not extrude outside the 2.55 inch diameter by 1.5 inch long cylinder form factor.  The input axes for the angular rates and accelerations form a right handed frame aligned with the IMU mounting frame.  The angular rate input axes shall follow a right hand rule.  The X unit vector of the right handed frame sha! ll be normal to the IMU attachment plane.  The positive X direction is opposite from the connector end, so looking forward from the connector end down the length of the cylinder shape is a +X direction.  The Y and Z axes lay in the IMU attachment plane following a right handed rule.  A detailed drawing of the mechanical interface, coordinate system definition, including electrical connector shall be provided.  The IMU shall operate and meet operational requirements in ambient surrounding air temperature that can vary from -25 to 85 degree C.  The cooling shall be by convection and conduction to the mounting surface.  The IMU shall have low frequency (less 100 Hz) linear acceleration inputs up to 30 g's and angular rates of up to 1200 deg/sec.  It is highly desired that the longitudinal axis (X) be capable of sensing >70 g's.  Nominal specific force and angular rate values for a nominal flight are provided in Appendix A.  Calibration to meet the minimum requirements shall be ! performed by the vendor.  Documentation containing calibration procedures and calibration residuals shall be provided.  The IMU shall average less than 5 watts of power with no greater than three separate power supplies required.  The IMU shall function properly irrespectively of the sequencing of the power supplies on power up.  Absence of one or more power supplies shall not cause permanent damage to the IMU. The IMU shall sense inertial angular rates without saturating up to  1200 deg/sec.  It shall also meet operational requirements from sea level to 50,000 ft and humidity levels up to 95 percent.  The IMU shall handle a 90 g peak half sine pulse, both operationally and non-operationally without failure.  It is anticipated that the delivery schedule for the initial order will be 1 unit no later than (NLT) than 4 months after day of award (ADA) with the next four units delivered NLT 6 months ADA, and the remaining 5 units NLT than 12 months ADA.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on or about 30 May 2005 and will be available at: http://www.neco.navy.mil/ or http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Award date is anticipated to be on or before 19 August 2005.

<DESC>NASA/KSC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the following Commercial item/services: NASA/KSC is developing a project to design and integrate a new Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) System at Building 60680 Hangar AE (HAE) on Cape Canaveral Air Station (CCAS), Florida.  The UPS System will be designed to integrate with the industrial power feed and generator power feed including associated modifications (i.e., a matching Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS), UPS/ATS/Battery Monitoring Systems, etc.) in order to support Launch Operations of Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELVs).  To accomplish the stated purpose, NASA will solicit offers to provide expert assistance in the development of the installation/integration design and expert services in actual installation and integration including supporting turnkey startup.  The contractor shall provide all management, labor, transportation, supervision, and necessary materials and equipment (except for noted Government furnished property) to assist in the detailed design and integration, for the Facility Launch Support (FLS) Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) System.  The FLS UPS System design shall include a Government provided UPS (300KVA / 270KW / 480V / 3 Phase Mitsubishi UPS), ATS, MOV Surge Suppressors, associated feed/load circuit breakers, and UPS/ATS/Battery Monitoring Systems.  The Mitsubishi Electric 300KVA UPS provides a match to the existing Building 60680 Hangar AE Power Generator and Industrial Power configuration without having to upsize the current 350KW KatoLight Diesel Electric Generator Set and introducing additional unnecessary costs.   The RFP will carry specifications to ensure 100% compatibility with the Government provided UPS. Since the UPS Module is the critical primary part of the UPS design, the contractor must also match all other supporting components to the overall UPS design for HAE compatibility (i.e., Batteries, Generator Automatic Transfer Switch, UPS/ATS/Battery Bank Monitoring Systems, AC Surge Suppression, remote status alarm panels, supporting AC and DC circuit breakers, spare parts kits, training, etc.).

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for a MGC Measurement Telemetry System. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from HBM Inc, Marlborough, MA.	HBM is the only known source capable of meeting the Government's requirement.  This system will be used to support ALDF Test Track Landing Gear Health Management experiments.	The system is compatible with an existing system used on the mobile runway friction test bed. A different system would not provide for interoperability between the two test facilities. The sole source authority for this requirement is FAR 13.106.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 12, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a Ball Grid Array (BGA) Rework Station (Sniper III with Micro Image System, P/N 7750-0033).  This item will be used to place and rework BGAs on high reliability printed wiring assemblies for MSFC space flight projects. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the item from Automated Production Equipment pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b).  Automated Production Equipment is the only source within the United States capable of meeting the technical requirements for a low production volume BGA rework station for high reliability flight hardware.  The BGA rework station must be capable of placing and reliably reflowing solder alloys used to attach BGA and micro-BGA components to printed wiring boards. To accomplish this requires a system that uses top and bottom low volume convection heating to ensure that the solder joints are produced in a tightly controlled environment and that the finished assembly will meet applicable NASA/industry workmanship standards. The Sniper III is the only BGA rework station which meets the technical and budget requirements (existing budget makes it impracticable for development of a custom unit to perform this function).   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 16, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a small business concern.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 339111, which has a business size standard of 500.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to procure Multitron II Shaking Incubators and accessories.  The laboratory has a pressing need for a bacterial Shaker capacity with multiple temperatures and multiple speeds because the different plasmids to be amplified have different requirements based upon their different sizes and characteristics.  This “stacked” bacterial Shaker can accommodate three temperatures and/or speeds in the space of a single Shaker; temperature control is documented and is +/- 0.3 C.  This is a compact, stackable shaking incubator with a patented drive system.  Movement is transmitted without the usual mechanical components.  This produces less noise, less wear, and no vibration.  Integrates the shaking mechanism into the bottom of the case instead of an external drive mounted through the bottom of the shaker.  It is a brushless, three-phase drive system with an AC motor.  This allows a smaller and more “air tight” cabinet, which allows the unit to run in a CO2-controlled atmosphere from 0-20%.  Incubator holds 40 deep well plates and 120 standard Microtiter plates.  The following instrument and products may be acquired under this acquisition: Item/Description/ Quantity: (1) Multitron II Shaking Incubator, qty-3, (2) Peltier cooling unit, qty-3, (3) Universal trays w/sticky stuff, qty-3, (4) Slide-Out Incubation shelf, qty-3, (5) Support Base 6”, qty -1, (6) Cover frame for stacking, qty-1, (7) Triple anchor bars for stacking, qty-1, (8) Shipping and Installation qty-1.

<DESC>USAID/CAR Regional Mission intends to issue a solicitation for one performance-based, cost-reimbursement contract for the Land Tenure Reform Program in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.  The period of performance is anticipated to be 3 years, beginning about September 30, 2005. 

The overall goal of this program is to strengthen the developing market economies by (a) facilitating the development of  vibrant, modern agricultural markets through more productive ownership, use and management of farmland, and (b) by facilitating the creation and development of an urban land market through effective land management, use, and transactions. 
 
The proposed program in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan would serve as a follow-on to the activities implemented under the Mission’s current land reform programs. The program will build on the outcomes of the ongoing Kyrgyzstan Land Reform Project, Legal Assistance for Rural Citizens (LARC) Project, regional Land Tenure Reform Project, and Land Legislation Development Project in Tajikistan, which will end in late 2005.
 
Tajikistan. The program will aim to help further develop a market-oriented land reform legislation and policy in Tajikistan; increase capacity of GOT agencies to properly implement land reform and draft appropriate new land legislation; and increase farmers’ awareness of their land related rights and obligations and their capacity to realize those rights.
 
Kyrgyzstan.  The program will aim to address the existing gaps in the area of land reform.
 
Despite significant achievements in the area of land reform in Kyrgyzstan, the legal framework for land use, management, and ownership is not yet sufficiently robust to accommodate economic change and the need for investments. It fails to encourage farm planning and more efficient use of land through crop rotation and inventing other techniques to improve yields and land productivity on the part of owners and users of rural land. In addition, the existing ownership and rental restrictions result in reduced land market activity, land underutilization, and lower incentives for investment. 
 
Urban land reform issues were included into the 5th Investment Matrix approved by former-President Akaev. Such issues are partially addressed by several donor activities. Further reforms and streamlining of procedures are required to increase investment, both domestic and foreign, and to promote the development of the urban land market. This will require innovative urban development strategies designed to attract private investment, further development of a real estate market based on reliable property and use rights, and transparent procedures for obtaining and exercising these rights. 
The estimated cost of the contract over the 3 year period is about $5 million.  It is anticipated that RFP for this work will be issued on/about May 27, 2005 and that award will be made on or before September 30, 2005.

Phase One solicitations will be issued on/about May 24, 2005.  The Phase One proposal due date will be identified in the Phase One Solicitation.  The Phase One solicitation will provide the scope of work, and the following evaluation factors, which are all in descending order of importance: 1) Past Performance; 2) Technical Qualifications; and 3)Technical Approach.  Phase One qualification proposals will be evaluated to determine which firms will be selected as offerors for Phase Two.  

Participation by small, small-disadvantaged, HUBZONE small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small business is encouraged.  Faith-Based and Community-Based Organizations have the right to submit offers/bids with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible. 

Phase Two participants will submit competitive past performance, technical, and price proposals as defined in the Phase Two solicitation.  The Phase Two evaluation factors, in descending order of importance are: 1) Past Performance; 2) Preliminary Design, Proposed Technical Solutions, and System Demonstration;  3) Specialized Experience and Proposed Organization; 4) Management and Scheduling Approach including Construction Quality Control and Quality Assurance and Post Construction Maintenance and Service; are significantly more important than Price.  However, as proposals become more equal, price becomes more important and may be a determining factor for award.

1.1.2	The back legs shall extend away from the boom swing area at approximately right angles and shall not extend more 7’-8 1/2” from the base of the kingpost.  The kingposts and both supporting back legs will be mounted on foundations at the same height.

DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Work to be done:  The work consists of furnishing labor, materials and equipment and performing all work in strict accordance with the statement of work and sketch forming parts thereof for the Work Order # 31566 Installation of Exhaust Duct System for stationary air compressor (Quincy Rotary Screw Air Compressor, 110 HP, 492 ACFM@100PSI) through the Roof, B925, Support Center Pacific, Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan. 

STAEMENT OF WORK: The work shall consist of, but not limited to, installation of a metal duct to exhaust the air to the outside atmosphere. Duct work should be approximately 8’ feet in length and vented to the outside atmosphere directly above the compressor unit. This will need to go directly through the roof of the facility.  Roof penetration will need to be water tight and the roof-mounted ducting must be able to withstand the winds that accompany typhoons in this region. The duct can be made of galvanized sheet metal but must match the existing output size of the compressor exhaust vent, approximately 40 inches square. The rain hood (or vent cap) exiting the roof should be made of a material resistant to corrosion and compatible with the galvanized sheet metal and shall prevent rain from entering the machine. The ductwork will require a flex connection a minimum 12 inches in height be installed. This flexible connection should be above the ceiling. We will require a second flex connection for the existing air compressor ductwork. This should include installation to the existing ductwork. This project may require existing air conditioning ductwork to be relocated and/or blanked off. The new ductwork shall be insulated to match the existing system style and specifications.

Background Information

Significant requirements analysis and design work has been conducted on the LIONS to ECMS conversion. Some prototyping code for ECMS has been developed.
Note: After receipt and review of the information obtained through this RFI, EOUSA intends to establish a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to complete the ECMS design, system development, and deployment to all 94 USAOs.

<DESC>Justification for Brand Name or Equal is as follows:

The equipment described in paragraph 3 consists of new and additional SCBA items needed to provide respiratory protection equipment that is specifically designed to meet current program requirements and maintain existing program functions within Navy Region Mid-Atlantic Fire & Emergency Services.

NRMAFES utilizes Mine Safety Appliance (MSA) respiratory protection equipment in support of its comprehensive respiratory protection program, thereby insuring the highest level of respiratory protection for the first responder.  NRMAFES has established a MSA inventory consisting of oxygen cylinder tanks, breathing apparatuses, hoses, air packs and regulators, and bench stock repair items.  Also, NRMAFES has purchased expensive and specialized tools to make repairs on MSA equipment.  Integration of MSA upgrade and repair equipment into the existing respiratory program is considered critical for continuity and uniformity with the fire department’s respiratory program.  MSA component parts, such as, bypass valves, valve assemblies, threaded hose assemblies, diaphragm assembly, valve forks, relief valves, slide adapter assemblies, inlet disc's, speaking diaphragm, retaining rings, o-rings, regulators, harnesses, integrated personal alert safety system, face pieces, rapid intervention connections, heads-up display (HUD), etc. are patented and specifically designed and compatible with only MSA manufacturer respiratory equipment.  Utilization of another manufacturer's component parts would result in incompatibility of form, fit, and function. Examples of form, fit and function are: different inside & outside diameters of O Rings, different threads per inch between attachment hardware, flow & pressure inconsistencies, valve flow rates, regulator adjustability, hose specifications and lengths, testing procedures, torque values, harness material length & width, HUD ability to accurately receive transmitter signal, etc.  Purchase of respiratory protection equipment not manufactured by MSA will result in respiratory protection equipment replacement financial cost of $2M. Replacement figure does not take in to account cost to purchase bench stock repair items and tools, compliance training for all personnel, software replacement for specialized testing equipment, etc.  Furthermore, MSA respiratory protection equipment complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations and National Fire Protection Association self-contained breathing apparatus standards.

<DESC>ENGINEERING AND DESIGN SERVICES FOR VARIOUS MULTI-DISCIPLINE PROJECTS PRIMARILY IN THE STATE OF MAINE

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.  ALL INFORMATION REQUIRED TO SUBMIT STANDARD FORM 330.
Engineering and design services are required for an indefinite quantity contract, N62472-05-R-6514, for the preparation of architectural and engineering studies, plans, specifications, cost estimates and design-build Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for multi-discipline projects at various locations primarily in the state of ME.  

The NAICS Code is 541310 and the small business size standard classification is $4,000,000.  The proposed contract is considered for 100% small business set-aside.       

The preponderance of projects envisioned for these contracts are in the $100,000 - $5M range of estimated construction cost.  Project work may consist of, but is not limited to:  (a) new construction, renovations, alterations, change of use or repairs of office buildings, recreational and research facilities, etc., (b) general repairs of barracks, window wall replacement, utilities, communications and electrical distribution systems, fire and intrusion detection and alarm systems,  (c) site work, oil water separators, etc.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command is moving towards Design-Build as the preferred method for acquiring capital improvements.  Though Design-Bid-Build methodologies (with the preparation of 100% Plans and Specifications) will continue to be utilized, a significant number will likely require preparation of Requests for Proposal packages for Design-Build solicitations using abbreviated (0% - 30%) design documentation.  Packages would include elements of site/engineering investigation, architectural programming, and functional/performance specifications.

The following services may also be required: facility planning which includes project programming documents, development of requirements, preparation of engineering evaluations, project scope, and unit guidance or parametric cost estimating, development of alternatives and economic analysis; analysis of proposed sites for foundations, utilities, access, constraints and identification of environmental issues; facility design/construction packages, sustainable design analysis and project implementation, design-build Request for Proposal packages, government collateral equipment lists, project preliminary hazard analysis, obtaining permits and regulatory approvals, comprehensive interior design, review of the contractor’s submittals, field consultation and inspection during construction, Title II Inspection, Operation and Maintenance Support Information (OMSI), and as-built drawing preparation.  The initial project will be determined at a later date.  Projects assigned to this contract may include work in the following specialties:  Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, Fire Protection, Architectural, Interior Design and Landscape Architecture.  

Phases and/or pre-priced contract options may be included and will be exercised at the discretion of the government for 0 – 35%, 35 – 100% design, and post construction contract award services.  Contract award is contingent on availability of funds.  Options are normally exercised within several months of completing prior work; however, delays of up to one year are possible.  Some projects will require design in the metric system.  

As part of this contract, an asbestos and/or lead-based paint assessment may be required to determine the presence of hazardous material during removals/demolition or at utility points of connections.  Firms must be able to accept work that involves asbestos, lead paint, PCB’s, and other hazardous materials.  

Work will be prepared utilizing AutoCAD 2000 or higher.  Specifications will be prepared using SPECINSTACT  program, and cost estimates using the “Success” estimating program in a Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) system format will be utilized. Selected firm will be required to provide documents in pdf format for posting to a Government web site during solicitation.

Firms are advised that the selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract. This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents, facility siting studies, environmental assessments, or request for proposals for Design-Build projects, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost. 

The contract requires that the selected firm have on-line access to email via the Internet for exchange of correspondence/information.

The WDTC plans, conducts, evaluates, and reports on tests of military equipment; and tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with this equipment.  WDTCs mission focuses on military chemical / biological (CB) defense, smoke, and illumination systems; and related operational concepts.  WDTC also plans, conducts, evaluates, and reports on non-CB testing for the Department of Defense (DoD) and other federal agencies, such as munition system assessm ents.  The WDTC regularly participates in the development and validation of technologies and methodologies to support assigned testing. The scope of effort involves supporting the WDTC test mission at the U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah installation.  The support involves (as associated with specific task orders) conducting technical studies associated with experimental design and statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, developing computer software applications, providing technical writing support, preparing test plans, preparing other documents associated with testing (e.g., environmental assessments), monitoring data acqu isition in the field, reducing and statistically analyzing data collected, preparing test reports, editing documents, preparing new documents and editing previously prepared Government documents in various stages of development, and preparing comments on G overnment documents.  WDTC is currently fully certified under the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001-2000 Quality Management System.  WDTC is fully committed to this standard and continues working to stay fully compliant with the standard.  This requires maintaining extensive oversight of the overall WDTC quality system.  Because documents are one of WDTCs primary products, quality controls in the development of each document are critical to WDTCs success as an industry leader.  It is imperative that WDT C effectively control all documents associated with our testing environment.  Standing Operating Procedures (SOP), Test Operations Procedures (TOP), Division manuals, work instructions and all other test related documents must be secured and kept up to dat e.  The ultimate contract will require the Contractor to play a significant role in the management of all WDTC controlled documents.

This requirement is set-aside for small business.  The applicable NAICS code is  541710 (500 employees).

The WDTC plans, conducts, evaluates, and reports on tests of military equipment; and tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with this equipment.  WDTCs mission focuses on military chemical / biological (CB) defense, smoke, and illumination systems; and related operational concepts.  WDTC also plans, conducts, evaluates, and reports on non-CB testing for the Department of Defense (DoD) and other federal agencies, such as munition system assessm ents.  The WDTC regularly participates in the development and validation of technologies and methodologies to support assigned testing. The scope of effort involves supporting the WDTC test mission at the U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah installation.  The support involves (as associated with specific task orders) conducting technical studies associated with experimental design and statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, developing computer software applications, providing technical writing support, preparing test plans, preparing other documents associated with testing (e.g., environmental assessments), monitoring data acqu isition in the field, reducing and statistically analyzing data collected, preparing test reports, editing documents, preparing new documents and editing previously prepared Government documents in various stages of development, and preparing comments on G overnment documents.  WDTC is currently fully certified under the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001-2000 Quality Management System.  WDTC is fully committed to this standard and continues working to stay fully compliant with the standard.  This requires maintaining extensive oversight of the overall WDTC quality system.  Because documents are one of WDTCs primary products, quality controls in the development of each document are critical to WDTCs success as an industry leader.  It is imperative that WDT C effectively control all documents associated with our testing environment.  Standing Operating Procedures (SOP), Test Operations Procedures (TOP), Division manuals, work instructions and all other test related documents must be secured and kept up to dat e.

This requirement is set-aside for small business.  The applicable NAICS code is  541710 (500 employees).

 MARKET VALUE:  GS-13 equivalent ($74,782-$97,213). Final compensation will be based upon the candidate’s past salary, work history, and educational background. Candidates who live outside the Washington DC area will be fully considered for this contract, but relocation expenses will not be reimbursed.

 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Washington DC

 SECURITY ACCESS:  Candidate must be able to obtain a Secret clearance

 AREA OF CONSIDERATION: Geographic Code 000
 
 
  POSITION DESCRIPTION

 I. BACKGROUND:
 
 USAID’s Asia and Near East Bureau (ANE) provides overall leadership for Agency programs in a region that is at the top of the U.S. foreign policy agenda and spans more than half the globe and a third of the world’s population.  This vast and diverse region covering East and South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa faces many challenges including terrorism, instability and conflict, poverty, a large population of unemployed youth, illiteracy, especially among women, an expanding HIV/AIDS pandemic, corruption and trafficking in persons and narcotics and environmental degradation.  USAID’s programs focus on building democratic institutions and processes, increasing access to quality education and workforce training, increasing trade, investment and productivity, improving the management and sustainable use of natural resources, and improving health, population, and nutrition.   The ANE Bureau in Washington is responsible for overall strategic planning in the region and program coordination with other U.S. government agencies and private organizations interested in the region.  The ANE Bureau also supports the work of 19 USAID field missions.
 
 Raising awareness about how the United States is working to improve the lives of citizens in the countries where USAID works is an important means of countering anti-Western propaganda.  Research in the West Bank and Gaza found that, after 10 years of USAID operations, only 50% of Palestinians had ever heard of USAID and only 5% were aware that USAID projects were paid for by the American taxpayer.  In Bangladesh, a society of devout Muslims receptive to modern ideas, USAID is reaching out to elements of influence and capitalizing on the relationships built up between our societies over the years.  Improving outreach is an essential means of achieving U.S. foreign policy objectives in the ANE region and a priority for the ANE Bureau.
 
 
 II. BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSITION:
 
 The Senior Outreach Coordinator is responsible for designing and implementing a communications strategy to raise awareness of USAID’s work in the Asia and Near East region and for providing support and advice to ANE/Washington and field mission staff on outreach initiatives.
 
 S/he is a member of the Strategic Planning and Operations (SPO) office in the Bureau for Asia and the Near East. The incumbent has primary responsibility for ANE Bureau outreach and communication activities and is the point of contact for field missions and the Legislative and Public Affairs (LPA) Bureau on outreach and communication matters.  The Senior Outreach Coordinator reports to the Strategic Planning Team Leader in the SPO office.
 
 III. DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES: 

Primary Responsibilities:
•	Review and update the ANE Bureau’s outreach strategy, as necessary, to achieve Agency and ANE communications objectives. 
•	Advise ANE senior management on improving public outreach, especially to target audiences, and assist with messaging on key issues. 
•	Identify, develop and execute outreach opportunities that support Agency objectives. 
•	Advise/assist ANE Field Missions with communication strategies and outreach activities, and support LPA in communicating new outreach initiatives and approaches to ANE Missions.

•	Advise on the design, content, and maintenance of ANE’s external website. 
•	Develop outreach materials in a variety of media in collaboration with ANE’s writer/editor.
•	Promote the use of audio and video in Bureau and Mission outreach activities. 
•	Serve as ANE’s point of contact with the Public Affairs Office of the Legislative and Public Affairs (LPA) Bureau and work with the LPA Press Office and LPA events coordinator on ANE-related events. 
•	Write and/or edit articles for the Agency newsletter and other publications. 
•	Prepare talking points and speeches for senior staff. 
•	Develop and update a communications toolkit for bureau and mission staff, in collaboration with the writer/editor. 
•	Schedule public speaking engagements and other outreach events for ANE Mission Directors visiting AID/W, in coordination with the geographic offices and LPA. 

Other duties: 
•	Participate in ANE activities and initiatives, including conferences and workshops, as appropriate. 
•	Serve as alternate ANE point of contact for legislative matters. 
•	Assist with other SPO projects and activities, as needed.

<SUBJECT>76 -- Scientific and Technical Book Account for Purchase On Approval
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), Only One Source Reasonably Available, with Yankee Book Peddler (YBP), Inc, 999 Maple Street, Contoocook, NH  03229.  NIST has a requirement for a scientific and technical Book Account with purchase on approval.
YBP provides books and supporting collection management and technical services to libraries The company possesses an online system for book title review and selection.  The YBP system possesses comprehensive approval plans, flexible notification/slip plans, continuations services, and a web-based bibliographic information database, GOBI.  The electronic notification system, GOBI Alert, allows individual users to mark their requests online for library staff and receive lists of new books specific to their disciplinary interests.  
The NIST library staff and users require a broad range of highly scientific and technical books on an “as needed” basis and a generous approval and return plan that allows return of books up to 120 days after shipping.  The extended approval period is critical because books purchased for the NIST Research Library must undergo multiple layers of review prior to approval of purchase.  The Government is not aware of any other comparable source.  Additionally,  staff and users are trained and experienced users of the online system.  For these reasons, award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost in terms of time, personnel resources, and funding to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.   NIST intends to negotiate with YBP, the only known source that can satisfy this requirement.
This notice of intent is not a request for quotation; no solicitation is available, however, any interested party that believes it can meet the requirements may submit written notification to the Contracting Officer of their interest and bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements listed.  Such information will be reviewed to determine if it is necessary to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>R -- NATO Procurement and Supplies Service Official Notification of Call for Bids Regarding the Provision of Assessment Centers to Provide Assistance in the Recruitment of Senior Managers
<SOLNBR>CFB2005-11
<RESPDATE>051705
<ARCHDATE>05182005
<CONTACT>Lee Ann Carpenter, Trade and Industry Analyst, Phone 202-482-2583, Fax 202-482-5650, Email Lcarpent@bis.doc.gov - David Newsom, Trade & Industry Analyst - NATO Company Certification, Phone 202-482-7417, Fax 202-482-5650, Email dnewsom@bis.doc.gov
<DESC>The NATO Procurement and Supplies Service released an official notification of Call for Bids regarding the provision of Assessment Centers for use in the Recruitment of Senior Managers. The Human Resources Directorate of the Headquarters Management Board (HQMB) was tasked with defining the requirements for a product that could be used on demand and for placing a contract with an external supplier (the Technical Partner).

SCOPE OF PROJECT

NATO authorities have decided to request the services of Assessment Centers to provide assistance in the recruitment of senior managers. The focus of the Assessment Center is to explore the level of each participant in a number of competencies (interpersonal and managerial, in most cases) and job requirements. The Partner will agree with NATO on a menu of methodologies, exercises and cases available. Each Assessment Center will then be designed using the elements from that menu that are appropriate for each vacancy. The Partner will provide at lease 2 experts as observers and evaluators for each Assessment Center. NATO will provide a maximum of 4 observers for each assessment. Before starting implementation, the Partner will train and certify selected NATO staff members (maximum of 20) as observers and evaluators. A program for ongoing recertification will be put in place.  

The goal is to sign a contract with an external provider able to run Assessment Centers on demand. Since the real usage will depend on the interest shown by the division, it is difficult to estimate the number of sessions per month or per year. In any case, it is not possible to commit to a minimum number. The maximum, however, could be set at two per month. The duration would be one to two days, depending on the position to fill in. 

ELIGIBILITY

Bidders shall attach a technical proposal, in triplicate as described below, for the provision of the services proposed in the bid. In this technical proposal, bidders are requested to provide clear documentation on their methodology. They will submit a written proposal stating their ability to respond to the requirements as defined in Part II and how they propose to do so. Bidders must include in their proposal a list of references to similar services they have performed within the past 5 years, preferably for international organizations. This list shall include the names and addresses of customers so that NATO may contact them if necessary.

APPLICATION

Bidders shall submit their technical bids with no mention of prices in triplicate in an envelope bearing the firm name and the enclosed official mailing label (see General Contract Specifications). PROPOSAL OF SERVICES is to be clearly marked on the envelope.  

In addition, bidders shall submit their financial bids in triplicate in a second envelope bearing the firm name and the enclosed official mailing label (see General Contract Specifications). FINANCIAL PROPOSAL is to be clearly marked on the envelope.

To be taken into consideration, it is IMPERATIVE that the supplier returns the Acceptance document duly completed and signed as the first document included in their PROPOSAL OF SERVICES part of the bid (first sealed application).

Potential bidders are herewith informed that they may not modify the submission procedure under any circumstance whatsoever. Bids received by e-mail, fax, or any other means not respecting the confidentiality required and insured by the sealed envelope procedure will be eliminated.

All deliveries and works to be carried out for this project by a Contractor or his Subcontractors shall be performed by firms from participating countries only.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Bids must be in the possession of the NATO Procurement & Supplies Service by MAY 17, 2005 AT 12:00 PM BRUSSELS TIME, at the latest.

2. Failure to comply with this deadline will produce automatic elimination of the late bid.

BID SUBMISSION PROCEDURES

This procurement (CFB 2005-11) will follow the procedure referred to in Part II of the Special Contract Specifications. All firms interesting in pursuing this project must obtain a copy of the Special Contract Specifications, which includes the application and is available upon request.

An electronic version (PDF file) of the present Special Contract Specifications is available to U.S. firms upon request from the U.S. Department of Commerce. To receive a copy, send an email to Lcarpent@bis.doc.gov or dnewsom@bis.doc.gov.

Should a voluntary referral case be in progress and the employees supervisor contact the counseling staff or program with documentation of the employees work performance deterioration or aberrant behavioral patterns at work; the EAP staff shall confer with the supervisor, but shall adhere to the confidentiality requirements strictly, giving no indication of the employees previous self-referral.  The employee may then be contacted and advised of the potential benefits to sign a consent to give in formation to the supervisor. 1.14.  Managers relationship to the Employee Referral: Service Program Managers are to be advised of their responsibility for careful and consistent evaluation of the performance of their employees.  They should feel free to seek the guidance of the Progr am staff through their Civilian Program Coordinators and EAP professionals in dealing with employee problem situations.  Managers should unhesitatingly offer employees information on available counseling or health services.  With the cooperation of a perso nnel specialist, supervisors should seek to assist employees who may initially refuse help even though their work performance and behavior continues to be unsatisfactory. 1.15.  Program Coordinators Relationship to the EAP:  Program Coordinators are the officials designated by each of the participating components to administer the Program for their respective employees.  As such, they are ultimately responsible for the eff ectiveness of their agencys program, even though many of the skilled services are provided by a contractor.  The responsibilities of an agencys Program Coordinator are likely to include: 1.15.1.  Developing internal policy and program design 1.15.2.  Evaluating program results with respect to their employees 1.15.3.  Serving as liaison between the Service Provider and their respective employees. 1.15.4.  In cooperation with the provider, prepare necessary management reports for their use. 1.15.5.  Although Program Coordinators do not provide day-to-day supervision of contractor personnel, a close and cooperative working relationship must be maintained.  As indicated by the confidentiality regulations, Program Coordinators are part of their respective agencys alcohol and drug abuse prevention function;  they and the contractor personnel are therefore equally subject to the confidentiality requirements, and the exchange of client information between them does not constitute disclosure under t hose regulations. 1.16.   Personnel Office.  Personnel offices will provide advice and assistance in the application of the policies, procedures and guidelines of the EAP Program.  This includes referral to the EAP Program.  The staff of servicing personnel offices, as well  as officials designated for Privacy Act matters, should be included among those who are assigned to attend training and educational sessions provided by the Contractor. 1.17.
