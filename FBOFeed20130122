<DESC>The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Armament Directorate, Advanced Programs Division, System Interface and Integration Branch (EBSN), Eglin AFB, FL anticipates awarding a sole source, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to Rheinmetall Waffe Munitions Schweiz (RWMS) AG, Birchstrasse 155; Zurich, Switzerland 79395. It is anticipated that the total contract period of performance will not exceed 4 months from the time of award and will have an estimated value of $75K.<br />The Government will procure up to 250 rounds of Rheinmetall 25mm PGU 48/B (Formerly the 25mm x 137mm Frangible Armor Piercing (FAP) ammunition). RWMS PGU 48/B round was qualified in the GAU-22/A gun system upon completion of a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) in September 2012. The FCT qualification effort determined this ammunition to be safe for use in the GAU-22/A and effective against F-35 target requirements. These 250 rounds will be produced from materials readily available at RWMS' production facility in Switzerland. Since the materials are already in place, RWMS is able to manufacture and deliver the rounds, quickly which allows the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) a head start on Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&amp;E). As part of the F-35's LFT&amp;E and Developmental and Operational Test (DT/OT), this FAP ammunition's performance will be evaluated with respect to the GAU-22/A gun system and F-35 aircraft interface requirements. <br />THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The authority for this action is 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) <br />The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the contracting points of contact identified below. The Ombudsman is Colonel Deborah Cafarelli, AFLCMC Eglin, at 102 West D Avenue, Building 11, Eglin AFB FL 32542-5495. Her phone number is 850-883-3701. Collect calls will not be accepted.<br />For subcontracting opportunities, please contact Oskar Brodmann, 41443163741 or Rheinmetall Waffe Munitions Schweiz AG, Birchstrasse 155; Zurich, Switzerland 79395.<br />Please forward any written statements of capability to AFLCMC/EBSK, Attn: Capt David Mitchell, 207 West D Avenue, Bldg 349, Suite 626, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6864, or facsimile (850) 882-7983 or e-mail david.mitchell2@eglin.af.mil.

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>PURPOSE:  The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Upper Colorado Region has a requirement for heavy Equipment Rental for the Provo Area Office Forced Account (PAO FA) Group in the Provo Area Office.  This requirement is being procured in accordance with Part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations as a full-and-open competition and anticipates awarding an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  Reclamation intends to issue a competitive solicitation for this requirement.  Based on market research and Industry Day conducted on 12/28/2012, it was determined that insufficient numbers of small businesses expressed interest in being a Prime contractor on this project, and as such, it is anticipated to be full-and-open competition.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The principal components of the work are listed under the project description below: 1.  Provide various pieces of heavy equipment for rent as will be stated in Section B of the solicitation. 2.  Delivery and pick-up equipment to site locations which shall be determined prior to award of each Delivery Order. 3.  Provide maintenance and repair services, as needed, to the rental equipment as well as Government-owned heavy equipment on site.
NAICS AND SIZE STANDARD:  The NAICS code for this project is 532412 with a small business size standard of $30 million.
COMPETITION:  Solicitation R13PS40019 is anticipated to be conducted as a full-and-open competition.  The Government reserves the right to award with or without discussions. The project specifications will be defined in the solicitation document.  Project locations will be specified in each of the delivery orders prior to award.  The solicitation will require a substantial bid guarantee of 20% of the proposed price.  The Contract will require payment and performance bonds for 100% of the contract price.  Offerors must have sufficient bonding capacity. 
SOLICITATION RELEASE DATE:  The release date for the final and formal solicitation No. R13PS40019 is anticipated between January and February 2013.  Interested parties are encouraged to monitor this announcement for updates and the release of the solicitation documents.  The solicitation documents for this procurement will be accessible from the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, www.fbo.gov.  It is, and will continue to be, all potential offeror's responsibility to monitor the FBO website for any amendments, updates, responses to questions and answers, etc. as the Government will not be providing any other methods of information dissemination.
SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT (SAM, www.sam.gov):  The System for Award Management (SAM) is a recently implemented Federal Government owned-and-operated FREE web site that consolidates the capabilities in Central Contractor Registration (CCR)/Federal Register (FedReg), Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), and Excluded Parties List System (EPLS).  Offerors must be successfully registered in SAM in order to be considered for a Government contract award.  If you had an active record in CCR, you have an active record in SAM.  
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  The PAO FA Group provides in-house construction services on Government facilities, and on facilities of other federal agencies.  These services vary widely from embankment dam repair work to wetland mitigation construction efforts.  The location of construction also varies, and may be located anywhere in the 17 western states; however, the preponderance of construction projects fall within two general geographic areas.  The purpose of this contract is to provide for the heavy equipment rental needs of the PAO FA by breaking the 17 western states into two regions - a North region and a South region.  Award of this contract may be to a single vendor, or to two vendors - one for the North Region, and one for the South Region.  The regions will be defined in the solicitation.
The Government intends to make award to the responsible offeror submitting a proposal, which conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government. Technical information required to be submitted with the bid will be identified in the solicitation.

<CONTACT>Stephanie P. Fantasia, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-767-9523, Fax 703-767-2382, Email stephanie.fantasia@dla.mil - Megan R Kesler, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-767-9553, Email megan.kesler@dla.mil
<DESC><p>The DLA Energy Utility Services Division seeks to identify and obtain information from responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the natural gas distribution (221210), the water distribution system (NAICS 221310), and the wastewater collection system (NAICS 221320) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB), OH. Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity. The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system. Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. &sect;2688 - Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to assume ownership of the utility system(s) at WPAFB and as the new system(s) owner shall operate and maintain the system(s) and provide utility services to the Government. Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility system(s).</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter "Notice") is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility. Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation. Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming. Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead no later than 3:00 pm EST on February 5, 2013. Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address: (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating natural gas, water, or wastewater utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business). The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.</p>
<p>This Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool. As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed. If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the March 2013 timeframe. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice. All information received will be considered. Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.</p>
<p>If determined appropriate, the Government will issue the synopsis and solicitation in the Federal Business Opportunity ("FedBizOpps" or "FBO") system. To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in FBO, offerors must follow the steps outlined below. It is recommended that all potential offerors complete the steps outlined below in anticipation of a potential synopsis and solicitation to allow ample time for processing in each system.</p>
<p>1. Be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>2. Once registered in SAM, go to the FBO website at www.fbo.gov and log in. Verify your SAM registration within the FBO system. The FBO Vendor Guide is available at<br />https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf to provide assistance.</p>
<p>3. Once your SAM registration is verified in the FBO system, click on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD2345 - Military Critical Technical Data Agreement Form. You can also find the DD2345 at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf. Fill out the DD2345 form and submit a hardcopy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on the form. JCP will return an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification and expiration date within five days of receipt. Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect. Additionally, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.</p>
<p>4. Once you receive the approved DD2345 form from JCP and have verified your status on the JCP website, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link. The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN.</p>
<p>a. The MPIN number is a mandatory data element created by the CCR registrant and must have nine characters: at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number. No spaces or special characters are permitted. It allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also serves as a validation to access sensitive but unclassified documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.</p>
<p>5. Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors will submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button. Once vendors request explicit access, the FBO system will send notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, who will approve the request in the system. Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.</p>
<p>6. Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system, and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.</p>
<p><br />This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award. The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DLA Energy Contracting Office.</p>

The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements and is cited in each individual solicitation. The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left">Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The solicitation, attachments, and any subsequent amendments will be available at <a href="https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP"><span>https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP</span></a><span> on the issue date of 02/07/13. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c )(1). Approved source is CEF Industries (00268). While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC><br />The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a requirement to procure support services for the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN) program. Support services for the CIREN program include performing independent, quality control functions through a detailed electronic review of data collected by the CIREN centers. In addition, it requires the contractor to be familiar with the complexities of the Oracle database used to store the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) and CIREN Data for the purpose of generating generalized datasets for injury causation research.
<p>Line-by-line review of the coded data and critical reading of all text entries are necessary components of the CIREN quality control process, but the size and scope of the CIREN database are such that visual review cannot detect all the inconsistencies that are inevitably present in such a large endeavor. The contractor must possess in-depth familiarity with the data and the relationships between data elements to develop automated error checking routines (sometimes called "edit checks") that are installed in the database and run in real time to detect errors during the data input phase when they are more easily corrected.</p>
<p>This procurement is anticipated to result in a sole source contract for NHTSA's acquisition of support services for the CIREN program to Indiana University's Transportation Research Center (TRC) as detailed in the attached Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition. The justification is posted along with this synopsis of the action and a sample crash scenario so potential offerors other than Indiana University's TRC may demonstrate their ability to perform this work and be considered for solicitation for award of this action. Other potential offerors should submit a sample of a proposed edit check by February 20, 2013 that could be used to identify possible conflicts in coding or to test the accuracy of the coding within the sample case and prepare Bio-Tab coding for the attached sample case injury indicating the energy source, body region contacted, involved physical components, contributing factors and supporting evidence.</p>
<p>The solicitation DTNH22-13-R-00668 will be available for download from http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ on or about February 20, 2013. The point of contact for this procurement is Seth Moody who can be reached by email at seth.moody@dot.gov or phone at (202) 366-9557.</p>

Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6072, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.

Description
The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Radiation Oncology Branch, plans to procure on a sole source bases with Precision X-Ray Inc., 15 Commerce Drive, N. Branford, CT 06471 for upgrades to the government-owned Precision X-Ray X-RAD 225Cx Small Animal Image Guided Micro Irradiator. 

The products herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334517 and the business size standard in 500.  

Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.

It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this procurement.

Delivery shall be made within 4 weeks of contract award.

The Precision X-Ray X-RAD 225 Cx irradiator is a small animal radiation device that rotates around an isocenter similar to modern clinical radiation units and allows for treatment of fields of any size and shape from 1mm to 12 x12 cm which is appropriate for rodents and similar sized animals.  The image guided, conformal irradiator is the first of its kind at NIH and advances the studies of radiobiology, radiation oncology, and radiation protection to beyond state-of-the-art and leads to numerous productive and valuable research collaborations that will develop data to improve outcomes for patients with cancer treated with radiotherapy.  This instrumentation is used by the Radiation Oncology Branch of the CCR.  The Co-Pilot image software package will allow images generated from other modalities to be imported and fused into the existing Pilot workstation for better treatment accuracy. The SmART-Plan treatment plan interface is the most advanced TPS for small animal IGRT research to assist in the planning and visualization of complex 3-D conformal radiation treatments. 
The contractor shall provide:

	One Co-Pilot Image Registration Software Package

Precision X-Ray has developed a unique research platform which combines cone beam X-ray CT imaging and Orthovoltage X-ray in a single platform. This system is relatively new to the market but has already been purchased by several premier cancer research facilities in the US and abroad. Clinical IGRT based treatment is not new, but its application to small animal research is rather new and unique. There are only (2) commercially available platforms for small animal IGRT. The significant differences are stated below:

1.	Co-Pilot Image Registration software package: This software package allows images generated from other modalities to be imported and fused into the Pilot workstation for better treatment accuracy.
2.	SmART-Plan Treatment Planning interface Upgrade: This plan is the most advanced TPS for small animal research which provides a modularized graphical user interface to assist in the planning and visualization of complex 3-D conformal radiation treatments. The calculation of 3-D dose distributions performed using globally accepted Monte Carlo simulation techniques is used in clinics around the world. NCI will be able to join in essential collaborations with the SmART-Plan Treatment Planning interface upgrade.
3.	Treatment Applicators: This variety of applicators allows the user to create any shape necessary for optimal treatment.

The accessories and software requested will enhance the research and collaborations which will advance the studies of radiobiology, radiation oncology, and radiation protection to beyond state-of-the-art and lead to numerous productive and valuable research collaborations that will develop data to improve outcomes for patients with cancer treated with radiotherapy.  Precision X-Ray is the only known source that can provide these upgrades.

<DESC>The Division of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (DAIDS) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is committed to the development of efficacious preventive vaccines against HIV-1 for worldwide use to end the AIDS epidemic.  While industry, government, and academia have contributed considerable resources to this effort over the past 30 years, no fully effective vaccine has emerged.  A wide assortment of candidate HIV-1 vaccines have reached Phase I clinical trials but only three vaccine regimens have advanced to efficacy testing.  One of these 3 trials, designated RV144, has shown modest efficacy in humans and this result coupled with promising results from nonhuman primate (NHP) studies has now stimulated the field to continue to test more advanced vaccine candidates in humans.  Thus, the discovery and development, of preventive HIV/AIDS vaccines may be within reach.  To augment the development portion of the process for identifying and ultimately testing an improved HIV vaccine, NIAID will be using a staged development approach to allow the rapid advancement of promising HIV vaccine candidates to CGMP manufacturing for subsequent clinical testing.<br />
<p><br />The primary intent of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) solicitation is to provide support to multifunctional teams for advanced development and manufacture of HIV vaccines candidates that have demonstrated success in NHP challenge studies, equivalent preclinical animal models or early human clinical trials, and have demonstrated manufacturing feasibility.  The activities supported through this BAA will allow the further development of the current leading HIV vaccine candidates, based on existing data are defined below (the areas listed below are the primary areas of interest of this BAA, but not limited exclusively to these areas when submitting proposals):</p>
<p>&bull;	Recombinant HIV protein including HIV envelopes, envelope derivatives, Virus Like Particles, as well as formulations of HIV proteins with immune enhancers such as adjuvants and immune modulators.<br />&bull;	POX virus (e.g. Fowlpox, NYVAC, ALVAC, Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector-based vaccine candidates.<br />&bull;	DNA vaccines, including DNA delivery device technologies and DNA expressed immune modulators.<br />&bull;	Replication defective adenovirus vectors with low sero-prevelence in the relevant human population.<br />&bull;	Replication competent viral vectors (e.g. Flaviviridae, Adenoviridae, Alphaherpesvirinae, Rhabdoviridae.)</p>
<p>Awards will be based on evaluation of the potential to advance the vaccine candidates forward through a staged approach.  This staged approach will allow NIAID flexibility to quickly advance vaccine candidates into milestone drive CGMP manufacturing for testing in clinical trials.  Briefly, the 3 stages are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull;	Stage I- refinement and implementation of the product development plan and the initiation of limited activities to prepare for the CGMP production of the vaccine candidate; <br />&bull;	Stage II- manufacture, formulation, and release of the product for phase I/II/III clinical trials; and <br />&bull;	Stage III- continuation of ongoing stability program, pre-licensure activities, continued product characterization studies, and updated regulatory submissions that would allow the product to remain in regulatory compliance and acceptable for future clinical trials.</p>
<p>Each contract will be awarded for up to a two year base period to support Stage I activities and will include two options for Stage II and Stage III activities.  Options for Stage II and III awards will be exercised based on Go/No Go decisions.  Once Stage I milestones are met the decision to fund the option for Stage II will depend upon the scientific priority, program balance, and the availability of funds.  Likewise, the funding of the option for Stage III will depend on meeting Stage II milestones, as well as scientific priority, program balance, and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>All activities must be performed in strict adherence to FDA regulations and guidance, including requirements for manufacturing of the vaccine candidate under CGMP (21 CFR 11, 210, 211, 600-680, and 820) and the conduct of animal studies and assays under GLP (21 CFR 58).</p>
<p>It is anticipated that 4 to 6 contracts will be awarded beginning on or about July 1, 2014.</p>
<p>NIAID plans to use a staged funding approach.  The contract will be awarded for up to a 2 year base period to support Stage I activities and will include two options for Stage II and Stage III activities.  Below are the estimated cost and period of performance of each Stage:</p>
<p>Stage I:  Approximately $100,000/year for a maximum performance period of up to 2 years<br />Stage II:  Approximately $5,000,000/year for a maximum performance period of 3 years<br />Stage III:  Approximately $1,000,000/year for a maximum performance period of 2 years</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.   This BAA will be available electronically on/about February 5, 2013 and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK:</span></p>
<p>1.0 INTRODUCTION<br />This specification contains the requirements used at the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). The instruments are intended to be deployed for extended periods of time and provide near real-time accurate temperature, conductivity and pressure from the ocean from numerous NDBC moored buoys</p>
<p>2.0 REQUIREMENTS<br />The procured item shall include all hardware and software necessary to make recurring, on-demand measurements of the temperature, conductivity, and pressure of the ocean surface and subsurface and to communicate to an inductive modem at the surface (IMS). The instrument shall be battery powered, with an internal clock, and with externally programmable deployment parameters and sampling schemes. NDBC is seeking two configurations with two pressure/depth options of Inductive Modem Instrumentation (IMI):</p>
<p>1. Temperature, inductive modem<br />2. Temperature and Conductivity, inductive modem<br />3. Pressure/Depth Option Shallow for configurations 1 and 2.<br />4. Pressure/Depth Option Intermediate for configurations 1 and 2.</p>
<p>In addition, NDBC is seeking Inductive Modems at the Surface (IMS) to interface between the Inductive Modem Instrumentation and the buoy's controlling computer, and Inductive Coupling Devices to connect the Inductive Modem at the Surface with the buoy's mooring wire to which the Inductive Modem Instrumentation is attached.</p>
<p>Instruments are intended to be deployed for nominal 1 year durations (400 days) to depths of 750 meters, drawing power from their own internal power source. The instruments will provide temperature, conductivity, and pressure measurements in response to polling via inductive modem, located at the surface, on an hourly basis. Preference will be given to those vendors that demonstrate that their instruments are resistant to biofouling for the nominal one year duration and still meet the battery endurance specification. If instrumentation configurations are depth-dependent, the vendor should separate and specify operating depths for the configurations.</p>
<p>2.1 DATA STORAGE AND BATTERY ENDURANCE FOR THE INDUCTIVE MODEM <br />INSTRUMENTATION<br />Memory capacity should be at least 50,000 samples. Battery pack(s) should be shippable without hazardous material restrictions. The batteries should be internal to the instrument and provide sufficient capacity for a one year deployment and inductive communications up to 24 times per day for that one year. The batteries must be easily replaceable and the vendor shall provide a procedure for this process prior to award. All data, plus time marks and battery voltage must be stored internally and be retrievable after recovery. To extend battery life the Inductive Modem Instrumentation shall provide the capability to be commanded or after a given amount of time of no activity return to a standby mode of a very low power state. Upon the command of the Inductive Modem at the Surface, the Inductive Modem Instrumentation shall be able to return to an active state for data collection and transmit the data to the Inductive Modem at the Surface.<br /><br />2.2 SENSOR PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>2.2.1 TEMPERATURE <br />Range: -2 &ordm;C to +35 &ordm;C <br />Resolution: 0.001 &ordm;C<br />Initial accuracy: &plusmn;0.005 &ordm;C<br />Drift: Not more than 0.01 &ordm;C over 1 year<br />Maximum operating depth 750 meters. Options for lower cost instruments with the same range, <br />resolution, accuracy, and drift specifications to operate in depths 300 meters and less are desired.<br />Must not be biased by solar radiation</p>
<p>2.2.2 CONDUCTIVITY<br />Range: 0-7 S/m<br />Resolution: 0.00001 S/m<br />Initial accuracy: 0.0003 S/m<br />Drift: Not more than 0.004 S/m over 1 year (not including fouling or other environmentally induced drift). <br />Conductivity sensors which may be susceptible to bias due to biological growth should be equipped with a<br />safe and prudent method of inhibiting such growth. MSDS sheets must be provided for any chemical anti-<br />biofoulants that are used, and sufficient quantities of anti-biofoulant chemicals must be provided to meet<br />the one-year operating period under the sampling schemes in section 2.2.5 up to 24 times per day.<br />Maximum operating depth 750 meters.</p>
<p>2.2.3 PRESSURE/DEPTH <br />Shallow Option: Range (Depth equivalent): 0 - 300 meters.<br />Intermediate Option: Range (Depth equivalent): 0 - 750 meters.<br />Resolution both options: 0.002% of range.<br />Initial accuracy both options: 0.1% of range.<br />Drift both options: Not more than 0.05% of range over 1 year<br />Wetted materials shall be seawater compatible</p>
<p>2.2.4 CLOCK ACCURACY: &plusmn;5 ppm (&plusmn; 3 min after 1 year). The clock must have the capability to check its accuracy and correct in the pre-deployment configuring. An option to check and correct clock from surface buoy via IMS is desired.<br /><br />2.2.5 SAMPLING: Sample and data storage rates should be user selectable. The instrument must be capable of sampling all sensors (Temperature, Pressure, and Conductivity) at rates of up to 1 Hz. Single samples or<br />averages of samples shall be stored at rates of 5 seconds to 1 day. Temperature and Conductivity samples should be sufficiently coincident in time to suppress spiking when salinity is computed. Sampling and<br />averaging shall take place upon command from the Inductive Modem at the Surface, and be configurable in the pre-deployment configuration.</p>
<p>2.2.6 MECHANICAL:</p>
<p>2.2.6.1. Size/Weight/Configuration: Instruments and associated mounts should be small and streamlined to decrease drag and vulnerability to catching on fishing nets or line. The combination of sensors, mounting devices, flow-through devices, and optional anti-biofouling accessories should result in an integrated instrument not larger than 7.0" in width or breadth and less than 27" in length.</p>
<p>2.2.6.2 Case Design/Materials: All external materials shall be highly resistant (nearly immune) to seawater corrosion. Case/endcap design shall have safety features that minimize the risk to personnel opening cases. <br />For example: Thread design that allows pressure to vent before endcap becomes disengaged from thread. Electronics, batteries, memory, and sensor mounting (temperature, conductivity, and optional pressure) should be integrated and encased in a single, highly corrosion resistant pressure vessel. Exposed sensor heads and attached flow systems may protrude from the single pressure vessel not to exceed size specifications in 2.2.6.1 above and not interfere with the mooring line.</p>
<p>2.2.6.3 Mount Design: Instruments will be mounted to mooring line ranging from 3/8"OD-3/4"OD. Mounts and clamping should accommodate this range of diameters, or be adaptable either by vendor customization, or the vendor providing specifications that the mounts can be altered by NDBC to meet the required range. Mount(s) must be streamlined to decrease vulnerability to catching on fishing nets or line and should have all captive parts with high resistance to seawater corrosion. Mounting system should be very robust to survive the energetic conditions of surface mooring motion and line strumming, yet should not permanently damage the mooring line. Accessories to streamline the mounting and reduce vulnerability to fishing nets or line should be described and quoted separately.</p>
<p>2.2.6.4 Vibration: The instrument and wire attachment clamps should survive the continuous energetic conditions of surface mooring motion and line strumming in the frequency range of 5 to 20 Hz.</p>
<p>2.3 COMMUNICATIONS<br />The attachment technique of the toroid to mooring line must be very simple, and easily performed on the deck of a moving ship using all captive parts.<br />The instrument should provide reliable, low-cost, low-power, real-time half-duplex ASCII data transmission via an inductive modem compatible with the Seabird Electronics, Inc., DPSK (differential-phase-shift-keyed) protocol, using a single, plastic-coated, mooring cable or insulated wire. The modem and inductive coil are to be integral to the instrument. Instruments may be clamped anywhere along the mooring cable of up to 750m length. On the buoy, a corresponding Inductive Modem at the Surface (specifications follow) completes the link between the underwater Inductive Modem Instrumentation and a computer or data logger. Module addresses should be sufficient for up to 20 instruments per mooring. Modules shall be commanded to return either averaged or instantaneous data. Communication scheme should be able to transmit through 750m of insulated mooring wire on a spool, as a check out procedure prior to deployment.&nbsp; Lab diagnostics, setup, and data extraction may be performed by looping any insulated wire through the inductive core and connecting the wire ends to the Inductive Modem at the Surface, by plugging in directly to the instruments external connector.<br /><br />2.4 SOFTWARE<br />The vendor shall provide programming, test and data processing software that are executable on a standard Windows 2000 PC or notebook computer. The software shall include the programs, utilities, and instructions necessary to communicate and retrieve stored data from the internal memory, and configure the instruments for testing and pre-deployment configuration. Additionally, a graphical representation of all stored data should be provided for "quick-look" evaluation of data. The vendor shall provide documentation on the operation, interface, configuration, and use of the software with the instrumentation and modems.<br /><br />2.5 INDUCTIVE MODEM AT THE SURFACE (IMS)<br />The IMS shall be able to interface and communicate with the Inductive Modem Instrumentation, described in Section 2.2 above. The IMS shall meet the above specifications for Communications and Sampling. The IMS shall provide an RS-232C interface for connection to the buoy's controlling computer. The IMS shall consist of a single, printed circuit card no larger than 4.5 by 6 inches. The IMS shall be able to interface with the Inductive Coupling Devices specified below in section 2.6. The Inductive Modem at the Surface will use the buoy's power service that ranges from 8 to 20 VDC. The Inductive Modem at the Surface should draw no more than 60 milliamps of current in the stated range of operating voltages. Lower current draws are desired.<br /><br />2.6 INDUCTIVE COUPLING DEVICES TO THE INDUCTIVE MODEM AT THE SURFACE<br />Flexible Inductive Coupling Devices shall provide connectivity between the Inductive Modem at the Surface and the jacketed mooring wire to which the Inductive Modem Instrumentation is attached. The Inductive Coupling Devices shall be compatible with the Inductive Modem at the Surface and the Inductive Modem Instrumentation. The Inductive Coupling Device shall be able to span lengths up to 10 meters. The Inductive Coupling Device must endure and provide reliable connectivity for the nominal one-year deployment period and allow for the differential motion of the buoy and the mooring wire.</p>
<p>3.0 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>3.1 LABORATORY QUALITY ASSURANCE<br />The instrument shall be equipped with or have the software for performing internal diagnostics to check at a minimum the status and health of the battery pack(s), clock, and sensors.</p>
<p>3.2 CONCEPT QUALITY ASSURANCE<br />The contractor shall provide NDBC with documentation and test data demonstrating the proof of concept of their instrument against measured values from an independent instrument. If this documentation has been provided in the past to NDBC, it is not necessary to duplicate this effort.</p>
<p>3.3 DELIVERABLES<br />The following items shall be provided at a minimum for each instrument that is purchased:</p>
<p>a) Instrument including options, fresh internal Batteries (minimum remaining shelf life of 2 yrs), and internal memory<br />b) Documents as per 2.2, 3.1 and 3.2<br />c) Software as per 2.4</p>

Interested contractors, including the following NAICS Codes: 237110 - Water and Sewer Line and Related Structures Construction; 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services; 333318 - Other Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing or any other related NAICS codes&nbsp;are hereby invited to submit a response to demonstrate their technical, managerial, and business capability to provide the requested services. The estimated value of this work will be less than $10 million.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The proposed plan for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project is to deepen the navigation channel to a depth of -47 feet. Appendix Z of the Environmental Impact Statement explains that this will have an adverse impact on the dissolved oxygen levels in the harbor. In order to minimize these adverse effects, the Corps of Engineers (COE) plans to use a Dissolved Oxygen Injection System (USACE, 2012).</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS: All components of the systems must be constructed of materials durable in the marine environment and will not have detrimental effects on aquatic life. The injection system must be land-based, in order to meet the site-specific requirements. The system must be capable of diffusing 40,000 lbs/day of oxygenated water, achieve high oxygen absorption efficiency at shallow depths, ensure quick depressurization/dilution/mixing of the highly oxygenated water to prevent the potential for effervescence, and have the capability to efficiently dissolve pure oxygen as well as produce a highly superoxygenated discharge. The water intake and diffusion structures are to include screens appropriately sized to keep flow velocities from exceeding 0.5 ft/sec. The system CANNOT interfere with the navigation channel or require the installation of equipment below -100 ft. of the mean lower low water. The system must also operate independently without onsite personnel.</p>
<p>All interested firms with 237110, 541330, 333318 as approved NAICS codes and any other related NAICS codes have until 16 November 2012 at 2:00pm to submit the following information:</p>
<p>Name, address and DUNs number of your Firm</p>
<p>Point of Contact (name/phone/email)</p>
<p>Project information sheets providing evidence of capabilities to perform comparable work on two (2) and no more than (5) recent projects. Projects submitted should be no more than six (6) years old have a value of at least $2M. Include the project name and description of the key/salient features of the project, completion date, total value and your company's level of involvement in the project, i.e. subcontractor (type), prime, specific role etc. Additionally, if you were teaming with another firm, clearly identify your role on the project(s) submitted. Please provide at least one point of contact (with email address and phone number) for project validation. The Government will not give credit to projects if the lack of information hinders the ability to determine relevancy and/or level of experience.</p>
<p>Contractual questions should be forwarded to Whittni Wright at whittni.c.wright@usace.army.mil. <br />The requested information shall be submitted hard copy along with one (1) copy of CD-ROM via FEDEX or UPS to:</p>
<p>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers<br />ATTN: Whittni Wright<br />100 W. Oglethorpe Avenue<br />Savannah, GA 31401</p>

This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available services that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG).
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG/CG) currently operates Fourteen HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft. The aircraft is manufactured by AIRBUS MILITARY (formerly EADS CASA) in Seville, Spain. These aircraft are procured under the authority of the Coast Guard Aviation Program Management Office. While the base CASA CN-235-300M aircraft provides the foundation for the Coast Guard HC-144A, changes to base aircraft configuration and the addition of supplementary systems have been combined resulting in a CG01 version of the CN-235-300M. The end state for the fleet size is still under review but could include as many as 36 assets. The projected number of Coast Guard assets over the next five years includes up to twenty operational HC-144A aircraft with each averaging 1200 flight hours annually. The components listed are manufactured by Hamilton Sundstrand based out of Windsor locks CT, USA.</p>
<p>USCG OBJECTIVES:<br />To obtain a five year firm fixed price contract for services from a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 145 authorized overhaul and repair center or equivalent to effectively inspect, test, troubleshoot, clean, overhaul, repair, and modify, the listed HC-144A components to current OEM configurations while maintaining any CG specific requirements for return to service in a Ready For Issue (RFI) condition and CG operational use. The components must remain configured for installation on USCG HC-144A aircraft. Responses can be for all or for a few of the part numbers listed<br />To have all Components listed inspected, repaired, modified or overhauled IAW OEM repair specifications, and Component Maintenance Manuals, including Revisions, Service Bulletins, Modifications, and Amendments. <br />To have all Components listed overhauled, repaired, or modified for return to service with FAA airworthiness Form 8130-3 or other FAA authorized airworthiness form attached. <br />To have all Components listed overhauled, repaired, or modified for return to service within 60 calendar days after receipt of material (ARM) at contractors repair facility. <br />To obtain and maintain a current list and status of all OEM Overhaul, Repair and Component Maintenance Manuals (CMM), including Revisions (Rev), Temporary Revisions (TR), Service Bulletins (SB), Modifications (MOD), Amendments (AMD) or other specifications applicable to the overhaul, repairs and modification of the listed assemblies and its components <br />To track and document calendar time, flight time, flight/life cycles, all work and services performed on these components as required under USCG ACMS. Tracking provides significant component historical records of component installations, removals, overhauls, repairs, and modifications including component transit, storage, status, and locations. ACMS tracking provides and an effective means of configuration control to maintain the integrity of OEM overhaul/high time hourly intervals including flight and life cycle limits as applicable. For configuration control prior written approval of the CG Contracting Officer shall be obtained for any configuration changes to propeller assemblies, blades, and components. <br />REPLIES:<br />All interested parties should respond via email to: Linda Clark, HC-144A Contract Specialist at Linda.D.Clark@uscg.mil<br />Nomenclature and parts numbers that will be on the schedule are as follows:</p>

<DESC>INDUSTRY DAY NOTICE FOR IDENTIFICATION OF NEW METHODS OF DEMILITARIZATION (DEMIL) 

The Office of the Product Manager Demilitarization and the Joint Munitions Command will co-sponsor and host an Industry Day for the identification of innovative ideas regarding the increased efficiency of ammunition demilitarization (DEMIL), primarily at Army depot installations. 
As Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA), the Army is responsible for the demilitarization of all fielded ammunition for the Military Services that is unserviceable, obsolete, or excessive to requirements.  The DEMIL stockpile exceeds 600,000 tons and is projected to grow; stockpile reduction is a significant challenge.  Demilitarization is the destruction and disposal of Defense items so that they cannot be used for further military purposes and their residual parts can be safely handled and disposed of by civilian society. Ammunition Demilitarization is conducted at Army Depots and certain commercial facilities through a variety of processes including, but not limited to closed disposal technologies, Open Burn / Open Detonation, thermal destruction, explosive fill extraction, and disassembly.


The purpose of this Industry Day is to enable the commercial industry and the Army ammunition community to identify and discuss new and innovative ways of conducting ammunition demilitarization on Army Depot installations in an open forum.  It will also explore the idea of public private partnerships at ammunition depots accomplishing demilitarization as a mechanism to encourage investment and increase efficiency in depot ammunition demilitarization operations.  This meeting is designed to provide depot capabilities and locations of ammunition stocks slated for demilitarization to commercial industry and solicit industry ideas on options for cooperative demilitarization operations between commercial industry and government depots.  The government will kick off this Industry Day with a detailed briefing highlighting the current Army Demilitarization Program to share information to spur discussion.  These slides are anticipated to be shared on this site on or around November 14, 2012.  Attendees will have the opportunity to ask questions during Industry Day, and those questions will be answered as time permits.  Any unanswered questions will be posted as an attachment to this notice on or about one (1) week following the event.  All information discussed at Industry Day will be unclassified.  All media and recording devices, including cellular smart phones, will not be allowed.

Industry is cordially invited to attend the Industry Day to be held: Date: 28 November 2012 Time: 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Location:  Cannon Gates Business Center, 121 Buffington Road, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000

The Government will accommodate Industry requested One-on-One sessions on 29 November 2012.  These one-on-one sessions will be unclassified.  During these sessions industry will be permitted to ask questions about ammunition demilitarization and the depot efficiency initiative, or on any other information provided during the course of Industry Day.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division, has a requirement to procure the services of a Principle Investigator/Technical Subject Matter Expert.  This is in support of the United States Army Medical Material Development Activity's (USAMMDA) ongoing Phase II multi-center, placebo controlled study researching the effects of hyperbaric oxygen in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) wounded warriors with Intermountain Health Care  under the  authority of  FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A) and (B).   <br>  <br> Intermountain Health Care has provided subject matter expertise in the area of hyperbaric oxygen research for the last four years initially through an Interpersonal Agreement sponsored by the Navy followed by a contract awarded through the Army Contracting Command.  Intermountain Health Care has been instrumental in supporting the development of this novel project and subsequent regulatory and human protection documents to establish the study.  They have assured that safety standards for all chamber locations have been met and that training has been provided to the study staff to assure compliance with hyperbaric operation standards.  The study continues to make progress and requires that current scientific leadership remain in order to continue towards reaching programmatic objectives, to avoid significant delays to the program, and loss of substantial funds already invested in labor to develop all of the scientific documentation and research measures to support the DoD's goals within this study. <br>  <br> This continued effort will be for an additional 9 month period of performance. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: Nathan.c.jordan.civ@us.mail.mil no later than 9:00 a.m. on January 27, 2013.  <br>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY<br />A.1 INTRODUCTION<br />The US Marshals Service (USMS), Tactical Operations Division (TOD), Office of Strategic Technology (OST), hereby issues the Request for Information (RFI) for interested parties to address the long term requirement for contractor operation and maintenance needs of an existing government owned personnel tracking system (PTS). The current personnel tracking system can ingest a wide variety of personnel tracking devices on the market currently and has the ability to ingest future next generation devices. The proposed operation and maintenance of existing system would include maintenance and configuration of existing networking equipment, failover procedures, future enhancements to system, and replacement of hardware.<br />A.2 BACKGROUND <br />TOD/OST is responsible for deployment of technical security systems that reduce risk to government personnel and facilities. Specifically, the protection of government personnel traveling during their daily operations and missions is of paramount importance for the safety and security of government personnel. <br />A.3 PURPOSE <br />The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to have a contractor operate and maintain this government owned personnel tracking system. TOD/OST is looking to determine what manpower and resources are needed and what costs could be associated with a contractor run and maintained tracking system. <br />A.4 EXISTING PERSONNEL TRACKING SYSTEM OVERVIEW<br />PTS was developed by the Tactical Operations Divisions (TOD) Office of Strategic Technology (OST) to provide real-time tracking of assets through the use of GPS technology and with global airtime service providers (satellite, cellular). PTS allows TOD/OST and other USMS divisions to track a variety of assets for protective operations. The system includes a web mapping interface and is used in conjunction with additional hardware/software controlled by OST. PTS is a system that allows for the tracking of physical location of devices. This system is considered mission critical, and is utilized by several other components of the USMS. <br />A.4.1 SYSTEM CONFIGURATION<br />A.4.1.1 PRIMARY SITE TOPOLOGY<br />PTS primary site employs redundant devices and links for fault tolerance at each layer in the network topology.<br />The access layer consists of redundant uplinks, access switches, and firewalls. The inner firewalls provide a redundant gateway for local hosts and encrypted site-to-site tunneling to the backup site. They also provide Network Address Translation (NAT) services, and serve as the separation point between the public and private networks.<br />The outer firewalls control access at the network perimeter, and provide a redundant gateway for the inner and outer routers.<br />The inner routers provide a redundant gateway for the inner and outer firewalls as well as encrypted dynamic routing tunnels.<br />The outer routers provide redundant access to the internet service provider(s). Each pair of network devices is configured to provide automatic failover.
<p>The TOD/OST intends to use the information provided for planning purposes and to help it make strategic decisions regarding future management of the PTS. TOD/OST will not enter into a conveyance agreement as a result of this RFI. Although TOD/OST appreciates the efforts and input of all respondents, TOD/OST will not reimburse RFI respondents for any expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The RFI initiative may or may not result in future competitive solicitations to effectuate TOD/OST objectives.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
  This document is a Request for Information (RFI).  The government does not presently intend to award a contract but needs to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.
  If interested in this opportunity, please respond with a capability statement to patrick.groves@va.gov.  Please provide all relevant information, including DUNS number, business-size status, and socioeconomic category (if applicable).
PURPOSE
  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requires a schedule of custom leadership development programs in the "learning cohort" model for 30 of its senior contracting managers.  Learning cohorts engage in learning together over time-multiple sessions over many months with application time in between- and building a social network across organizations.
  This leadership development programs would ideally be provided by accredited postsecondary educational institutions.  The provider must document and certify the hours of organized instruction each attendee receives.  Instructors should be full-time, tenured faculty with advanced degrees in business administration; adjunct faculty with significant practical experience; or similarly accomplished leaders in the field of business administration.
SCOPE
  Multiple cohort programs must be held over different time periods.  Each cohort program should meet over the same length of time (e.g., 6-12 months), and have the same periodic cohort sessions (e.g., 1-3 days every 4-6 weeks).  Attendance will likely spread evenly across each cohort program, but up to 30 attendees may attend any one cohort program at any time.
  Some flexibility in cohort program length, cohort program frequency, periodic cohort session length, and periodic session frequency is allowed, but each cohort program should follow the same curriculum (to allow cohort program participants to attend "make-up" sessions with other cohorts).  All sessions for each cohort program should be held in the same location.
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE
  The period of performance must not exceed five years from the date of award-e.g., ten 6-month cohort programs, or five 12-month cohort programs.
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE
  In order to most easily accommodate the attendees' travel arrangements, the place of performance must be located in a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in the Continental United States (CONUS), and within 50 miles of an international airport.
BACKGROUND
  The General Schedule  (GS) contracting series' include positions that manage, supervise, perform, or develop policies and procedures for professional work involving the procurement of supplies, services, construction, or research and development using formal advertising or negotiation procedures; the evaluation of contract price proposals; and the administration or termination and close out of contracts.
  The VA's 30 senior contracting managers manage 2,500 contracting employees in contracting offices in 150 locations across the United States.  Each manager manages anywhere between 60 and 140 employees, and may manage employees in more than one location.
PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES
  The VA needs senior contracting managers competent to build a federal corporate culture that drives for results, serves customers, and builds successful teams and coalitions within and outside the organization.  The abilities below define these competencies:
"	the ability to bring about strategic change, both within and outside the organization, to meet organizational goals; the ability to establish an organizational vision and to implement it in a continuously changing environment;
"	the ability to lead people toward meeting the organization's vision, mission, and goals; the ability to provide an inclusive workplace that fosters the development of others, facilitates cooperation and teamwork, and supports constructive resolution of conflicts;
"	the ability to meet organizational goals and customer expectations; the ability to make decisions that produce high-quality results by applying technical knowledge, analyzing problems, and calculating risks; and
"	the ability to build coalitions internally and with other Federal agencies, State and local governments, nonprofit and private sector organizations, foreign governments, or international organizations to achieve common goals.
  Personal and professional attributes are also critical to successful performance in the VA.  The fundamental competences below serve as the foundation for each of the abilities above:
"	treats others with courtesy, sensitivity, and respect; considers and responds appropriately to the needs and feelings of different people in different situations;
"	makes clear and convincing oral presentations; listens effectively; clarifies information as needed; and
"	assesses and recognizes own strengths and weaknesses; pursues self-development.
  Well designed and implemented cohort programs increase opportunities for cross-organizational collaboration towards learning the abilities and competencies above.  The learning process should use real organizational issues for leadership training, e.g., bring attention to a strategic organizational challenge (the time between cohort sessions), then reflect on what they've learned as the move the task forward (the cohort sessions themselves).
DISCLAIMER
  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked as proprietary will be handled accordingly.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Simplified acquisition procedures will be followed. (ii) This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. (iii) This combined synopsis/solicitation will result in a firm fixed price commercial supply purchase order. (iv) Due to the fact the vendors selling this product are either the distributors and/or the manufacturer of this product or are foreign vendors, in accordance with FAR 19.102 and 13 CFR 121.406, this combined synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a full and open competition. The NAICS Code is 325320 with a size standard of 500 employees. (v) OBJECTIVE: This requirement is for The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), International Services (IS), facility in Tijuana, Mexico which has a requirement for an insecticide containing the active ingredient Imidacloprid. The governments of Mexico and the United States have determined that it is in their mutual interest to protect their citrus producing areas from Huanglongbing (Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus), considered by experts to be one of the most destructive diseases in the world. This disease is spread by the insect vector, the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP). As a result, both countries have agreed to the establishment of an ACP "Pilot Program" to suppress insect populations in Tijuana Baja California Norte. The primary goal is to prevent the migration of this insect vector into commercial citrus production areas further increasing the risk of future establishment of this destructive disease. SENASICA will lead the effort of this "regional program" in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Animal &amp; Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) and the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA). It has been determined that the compound, Imidacloprid, is the most effective systemic insecticide to control the ACP. The Mexican regulatory agencies, COFEPRES and SENASICA, have approved the use of Imidacloprid for the control of ACP. (vi) The PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE of this purchase order shall be from date of award through acceptance and receipt of the delivered items. (vii) REQUIREMENT AND QUANTITIES: The insecticide needs to meet the following requirements: The concentration of Imidacloprid will determine the quantity needed. Higher concentrations will require less liters. CLIN 001 - 900 liters of insecticide with Imidacloprid with a concentration between 20-40%. The selected contractor must be able to provide the entire quantity of insecticide requested. Shipping is FOB destination; therefore, shipping of the product to the USDA facility in Tijuana, Mexico should be included in the cost. The contractor will be responsible for packaging and shipping the product to the USDA facility. Prices shall be in U.S. currency. (viii) DELIVERABLES: The selected contractor must be able to deliver the product on or before FEBRUARY 15, 2013. Acceptance of deliverables and the shipment of the deliverables shall be to USDA, APHIS IS TIJUANA, Eusebio kino lote 3 y 4, Garita de Otay C.P. 22509, Tijuana, Baja California. Phone: 664-607-5062. (ix) TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: The insecticide must contain the active ingredient Imidacloprid with a concentration between 20-40%. Since the insecticide is mixed by APHIS, the concentration can be adjusted when mixed which is why the concentration of the active ingredient is listed as a range. Must be soluble in water. Due to the application in backyards, the insecticide must be applied in water form and not by leaving granules to be slowly absorbed by rainfall (which is a common form of applying Imidacloprid-based insecticides).Vendors are advised that the Government of Mexico has restricted the importation of Imidacloprid and other insecticides into Mexico. This restriction prohibits vendors from other countries from importing the product into Mexico. In accordance with the Mexican regulatory authorities only authorized vendors can distribute this product; therefore, the contractor must be an authorized distributor of this product.

The corresponding NAICS code for this procurement is 334516.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as Request for Quotations (RFQ) NIH-NLM-2012-583/SRE. The resultant order will be a firm-fixed price purchase order.<br /><br />
<p>In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to procure social media and engagement tool software license from a Contractor for professional services in monitoring the usage of NLM health information resources by consumers and also capable of examining such social media sites as Twitter, Facebook, blogs, news sites, discussion boards, video and image sharing sites with inquiries relevant to NLM issues and with full respect for privacy rights of those who created the social media entries. This acquisition is a 100% total small business set aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 511210-Software Publishers with a small business size standard of $25.0 million.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is the world's largest biomedical library and makes its stored information available online at no charge to consumers, health professionals, and biomedical scientists through a diverse suite of resources. Evaluating how its databases and other resources are utilized is an important component of continuing quality improvement and has long been an on-going program of NLM management through a potpourri of monitoring tools. The world-wide explosion in the use of social media provides a unique opportunity for sampling sentiment and use patterns of NLM's "customers" and for comparing NLM to other sources of health-related information.</p>
<p>Purpose:<br />The purpose of this requirement is to obtain software capable of examining such social media sites as Twitter Facebook, blogs, news sites, discussion boards, video and image sharing sites with inquiries relevant to NLM issues and with full respect for privacy rights of those who created the social media entries.</p>
<p>Scope of Work:<br />The work requirement will demonstrate an approach to comprehensive access to the target information within a framework suitable for flexible and rapid processing of queries created by NLM to ascertain a host of questions relevant to evaluation of its programs and those of its "competitors."</p>
<p>Project 1: Monitoring Usage of NLM Resources by Consumers</p>
<p>By examining relevant tweets and other comments, NLM will gain insights to extent of use, context for which information was sought, and effects of various health-related announcements and events on usage patterns including:</p>
<p>&bull; Relative frequency with which various NLM resources are mentioned<br />&bull; Comparison of NLM mentions with mentions of "competitors"<br />&bull; Identification of urgent information requests for which NLM could "push" vetted information free of advertising or commercial interest<br />&bull; Effects of topical health issues such as "mad cow" or West Nile Virus or disasters on use of NLM resources<br />&bull; Effect of changing NLM's interface design and textual/graphic style on usage by consumers<br />&bull; Effectiveness of NLM use of social media to distribute health information<br />&bull; Comparable analyses of other NIH and DHHS health information sources</p>
<p>Project 2: Monitoring Usage of NLM Resources by Health Professionals and Biomedical<br />Scientists</p>
<p>By examining relevant tweets and other comments, NLM will gain insights to extent of use, context for which information was sought, and reactions to information provided to clinicians involved in patient care, and scientists focused on research issues, including:</p>
<p>&bull; Citations of published papers available from NLM bibliometric databases<br />&bull; Citations of published papers available from NLM full-text references<br />&bull; Information-seeking behavior of clinicians and scientists<br />&bull; Effects on usage of modifying database design features<br />&bull; Professional comments about value of NLM's resources <br />&bull; Comparison of use of NLM resources to use of those provided by "competitors"<br />&bull; Regional and international differences in information-seeking behavior by professionals<br /><br />Contractor Responsibility:<br />Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, and equipment, not other&not;wise provided by the government, to provide the requisite services required to support this requirement which is directly related to the work of the NLM. All work shall be monitored and technically co-ordinated by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>
<p>Contractor Tasks/Services:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform the following specific tasks for Projects 1 and 2 in accordance with the respective project descriptions identified above:</p>
<p>Task 1: Install appropriate software on a Government computer(s) that is designed for efficient customer-friendly operation and has option of extending capabilities</p>

Content from Facebook, blogs, news sites, discussion boards, video and image sharing sites will be maintained by the Contractor and kept up-to-date in a timely manner and made available for query by the Government</p>
<p>Task 3: Provide an appropriate library of relevant search terms appropriate for the questions of interest to NLM.</p>
<p>Task 4: Train designated Government personnel in proper use of the licensed software and in efficient formulation of queries</p>
<p>Task 5: Provide on-going consultation as needed to refine queries of importance to government.</p>
<p>Task 6: Offer improvements to the software as developed from time to time by the Contractor</p>
<p>Number of Users:</p>
<p>The Government anticipates software licenses to cover two (2) users.</p>
<p>Deliverables:<br />&#9679;Evaluating On-line Resources of the National Library of Medicine by Mining Social Media: The final product will be an installed software package that meets the requirements of the Government for timely retrieval from Facebook, blogs, news sites, discussion boards, video and image sharing sites from the social media information stores maintained and kept current by the Contractor</p>
<p>&#9679;Expert assistance as needed from the Contractor to assist the Government in formulating inquiries with search terms and term combinations that will provide appropriate responses appropriate for the goal of Government questions relevant to the NLM mission</p>
<p>&#9679;Training of at least two Government staff members by Contractor personnel and through on-line resources <br /><br />&#9679;Display of search results in an efficient manner, preferably in dashboard form, suitable for analysis by the Government.<br /><br />&#9679;Periodic updates on status/changes in the social media environment</p>
<p>&#9679;A delivery schedule will be provided by the Contractor within 30 days of the contract</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

<p>1352.271-77 Delays (Apr 2010)<br />When, during the performance of this contract, the contractor is required to delay the work on a vessel temporarily, due to orders or actions of the Government respecting stoppage of work to permit shifting the vessel, stoppage of hot work to permit bunkering, fueling, embarking or debarking of passengers or loading or discharging of cargo, and the contractor is not given sufficient advance notice or is otherwise unable to avoid incurring additional costs on account thereof, an equitable adjustment may be made in the contract. Any such request for equitable adjustment shall be asserted in writing as soon as practicable after the delay or disruption, but not later than the day of final payment under the contract.</p>
<p>1352.271-79 Liability and Insurance (Apr 2010)<br />(a) The contractor shall exercise reasonable care and use its best efforts to prevent accidents, injury or damage to all employees, persons and property, in and about the work, and to the vessel or part thereof upon which work is done.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall be responsible for and make good at its own cost and expense any and all loss of or damage of whatsoever nature to the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo, and Government-owned material and equipment for the repair, completion, alteration of or addition to the vessel in the possession of the contractor, whether at the plant or elsewhere, arising or growing out of the performance of the work, except where the contractor can affirmatively show that such loss or damage was due to causes beyond the contractor s control, was proximately caused by the fault or negligence of agents or employees of the Government, or which loss or damage the contractor by exercise of reasonable care was unable to prevent. However, the contractor shall not be responsible for any such loss or damage discovered after redelivery of the vessel unless the loss or damage is discovered within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel and loss or damage is affirmatively shown to be the result of the fault or negligence of the contractor. To induce the contractor to perform the work for the compensation provided, it is specifically agreed that the contractor's aggregate liability on account of loss of or damage to the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and Government-owned materials and equipment, shall in no event exceed the sum of $1,000,000.00. As to the contractor, the Government assumes the risk of loss or damage to the Government-owned vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and said Government-owned materials and equipment in excess of $1,000,000.00. This assumption of risk includes but is not limited to loss or damage from negligence of whatsoever degree of the contractor's servants, employees, agents or subcontractors, but specifically excludes loss or damage from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of contractor's personnel, who have supervision or direction of all or substantially all of the contractor's business, or all or substantial all of the contractor's operation at any one plant. However, as to such risk assumed and borne by the Government, the Government shall be subrogated to any claim, demand or cause of action against third persons which exists in favor of the contractor, and the contractor shall, if required, execute a formal assignment or transfer of claims, demands or causes of action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall create or give rise to any right, privilege or power in any person except the contractor, nor shall any person (except the contractor) be or become entitled thereby to proceed directly against the Government, or join the Government as a co-defendant in any action against the contractor brought to determine the contractor's liability, or for any other purpose.</p>
<p>(c) The contractor indemnifies and holds harmless the Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, and the vessel against all suits, actions, claims, costs or demands (including without limitation, suits, actions, claims, costs or demands resulting from death, personal injury and property damage) to which the Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, or the vessel may be subject or put by reason of damage or injury (including death) to the property or person of anyone other than the Government, its agencies, instrumentalities and personnel, or the vessel, arising or resulting in whole or in part from the fault, negligence, wrongful act or wrongful omission of the contractor, or any subcontractor, its or their servants, agents or employees; provided that the contractor's obligation to indemnify under this paragraph (c) shall not exceed the sum of $1,000,000.00 on account of any one accident or occurrence in respect of any one vessel. Such indemnity shall include, without limitation, suits, actions, claims, costs or demands of any kind whatsoever, resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring during the period of performance of work on the vessel or within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel. Any new equipment warranties that extend beyond the 90 days after redelivery of the vessel shall be assigned to the Government upon redelivery of the vessel. With respect to any such suits, actions, claims, costs or demands resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring after the expiration of such period, the rights and liabilities of the Government and the contractor shall be as determined by other provisions of this contract and by law; provided that such indemnity shall apply to death occurring after such period which results from any personal injury received during the period covered by the contractor's indemnity as provided herein.</p>
<p>(d) The contractor shall, at its own expense, procure, and thereafter maintain such casualty, accident and liability insurance, in such forms and amounts as may be approved by the Contracting Officer, insuring the performance of its obligations under paragraph (c) of this clause. In addition, the contractor shall at its own expense procure and thereafter maintain such ship repairer's legal liability insurance as may be necessary to insure the contractor against its liability as ship repairer in the amount of $1,000,000.00, or the value of the vessel as determined by the Contracting Officer, whichever is the lesser, with respect to each vessel on which work is performed. The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies, However, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, such insurance need not be procured whenever the job order requires work on parts of a vessel only and the work is to be performed at a plant other than the site of the vessel. Further, the contractor shall procure and maintain in force Worker's Compensation Insurance (or its equivalent) covering its employees engaged in the work and shall ensure the procurement and maintenance of such insurance by all subcontractors engaged in the work. The contractor shall provide evidence of insurance as required by the Government.</p>
<p>(e) The contractor shall receive no allowance in the contract price for inclusion of any premium expense or charge for any reserve made on account of self-insurance for coverage against any risk assumed by the Government under this clause.</p>
<p>(f) As soon as practicable after the occurrence of any loss or damage, the risk of which the Government has assumed, written notice of the damage shall be given by the contractor to the Contracting Officer. The notice shall contain full particulars of the loss or damage. If claim is made or suit is brought thereafter against the contractor as the result or because of such event, the contractor shall immediately deliver to the Government every demand, notice, summons or other process received by it or its representatives. The contractor shall cooperate with the Government, and, upon the Government's request, shall assist in effecting settlements, securing and giving evidence; obtaining the attendance of witnesses, and other assistance required in the conduct of suits. The Government shall pay to the contractor the expense, other than the cost of maintaining the contractor's usual organization, incurred in this assistance. Except at its own cost, the contractor shall not voluntarily make any payment, assume any obligation or incur any expense not imperative for the protection of the vessel or vessels at the time of the event.</p>

<p>(c) The contractor must submit any proposal for adjustment under this clause within 5 days from the date of receipt of the written order.

However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(e) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable reduction shall constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(f) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name of its intention to--<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and <br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<p>(b) Include the substance of this clause, including paragraph (b), in all subcontracts with small business concerns.</p>
<p>(c) The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.201-70, Contracting Officer's Authority (Apr 2010). <br />The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73 Compliance With the Laws (Apr 2010) <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />1352.209-74 Organizational Conflict of Interest (Apr 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>
<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<DESC>AFRL/RQAC has a mandate to support a wide range of computational requirements for future Air Force systems. However, the initial focus for this Collaborative Center will be on developing and integrating all of the computational tools required to perform reliable, high-fidelity, multi-disciplinary analysis of high speed flows, fine-scale unsteady flows, and computational methods. As such, the CCAS will need to perform research in the following technical areas:
<p>i. High Speed Aero-Physics (for example, thermal/chemical non-equilibrium, rarefied/continuum flow, MHD, hypersonic configurations, shock-shock and shock boundary layer interactions, scramjet flow path analysis, supersonic combustion, steady and unsteady heat transfer, conjugate heat transfer, thermal loads, flow control, etc.)</p>
<p>ii. Fine-Scale Unsteadiness (for example, boundary layers, transition prediction, turbulence excitation/suppression, turbulence models, LES/DNS, separated flow, flow control, plasma/fluidic/mechanical actuation, secondary flow, shear layers, wake flow, acoustic/EM wave propagation, etc.)</p>
<p>iii. Enabling CFD technologies (for example, nonlinear/nonlinear fluid-structure coupling, grid motion/adaptation, generalized overset techniques, high-order and robust algorithms, uncertainty quantification, grid/geometry sensitivities, error assessment, software V&amp;V, computational model experimental validation, interoperable/framework computing, etc.)</p>
<p>Technical point of contact is Charles Tyler, AFRL/RQVC, Program Engineer, (937) 904-4045, charles.tyler@wpafb.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>P1449B is a Design-Build solicitation to implement steam decentralization projects at 163 buildings in the Hadnot Point/French Creek areas of the Marine Corp Base Camp Lejeune. Steam Decentralization will entail the removal of steam equipment at each facility and the installation of high efficiency systems such as natural gas fired hot water appliances, high efficiency heat pumps and hot water equipment to meet heating load requirements. There are two basic scenarios: 1 - Facility systems include the installation of natural gas fired hot water boilers housed within existing facilities, expanded mechanical rooms, or newly constructed mechanical rooms. The facility system will serve only the facility in which it is installed.
 2 - Heat Pump systems include the installation of electric heat pumps and hot water heaters to provide space heating/cooling and domestic water heating. Conversion of these facilities may include the installation of hot water piping, pumps, ductwork, air handlers, air blenders, variable air volume systems, etc.

(d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an "equal" product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation. (2) Price - The prices offered shall be submitted in accordance with the Schedule of Supplies and Services contained in the solicitation. Vendors responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request vendors to submit information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar items, sales history for the same or similar items, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts. Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote. (End of Text) <BR> <BR>Selection of a vendor for award will be based on two parts, as follows: (1) Technical Acceptability: The technical information submitted by each offeror will be evaluated against the specifications provided in the CLIN descriptions, Submission of Quotes, and Evaluation of Quotes and determined to either pass or fail. If the technical proposal is determined "fail", it renders the entire proposal technically unacceptable. If a technical rating of "fail" is assigned, the vendor may no longer be considered for award. The Contracting Officer will evaluate "equal" products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. (2) Price - The vendor's proposed prices will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness. (b) The PCO will review all of the proposals. Upon completion of the above, a single award for all items will be made to the offeror whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, is considered technically acceptable, i.e. received a "pass" evaluation for Technical Acceptability and whose offer is considered to be the lowest price. (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ANNOUNCEMENT.      <br>   This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement; market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.   <br>      <br>   1.	 Purpose.  The purpose of this project is to rehabilitate the spillway gates at Harlan County Lake's Dam.   It is anticipated that no more than 2 to 3 gates will be rehabilitated in a contract.   <br>      <br>   2.	Dam Location and Description. Harlan County Dam is located on the Republican River in south-central Nebraska near Alma, NE. The dam was built in the early 1950's as part of a flood control/irrigation project.  The dam is combined earth-rolled embankment and concrete gravity dam. The concrete section includes a controlled spillway regulated by 18 Tainter Gates, 9 sluice gates and two irrigation outlets. The Tainter gates are 40 feet wide and 30 feet high and located between piers located 48 feet on center. The existing piers are constructed of an 8 feet wide section above the spillway weir. The piers resist forces imposed by the water and Tainter gates under various water levels and gate configurations. The piers also carry loads from the bridge that spans between the piers. The reinforcing in the piers is typically spaced at 12 inches on center vertically and horizontally, with 4   quote mark  concrete cover.  The spillway bridge above the Tainter Gates is simple span with 18 spans.  The cast-in-place deck and sidewalks are supported by steel girders, floorbeams and stringers.  The steel members are non-composite with the deck.   <br>      <br>   3.	 Project Description.  The work in this project will consist of strengthening structural steel components of the gate, replacing the existing trunnion and bearing with new components, replace tainter gate chain, repair or replace electrical systems, and blast and paint the gate.  Challenging components to the contract are access to the gate, shoring of the gate, and installation of major mechanical and structural components.   <br>      <br>   4.	Access.  The ogee of the spillway at Harlan County is steep.  The reservoir will be regulated by the sluice gates during gate modifications, indicating an appreciable tailwater will be present.  The bridge across the dam cannot be permanently closed during construction and has limited capacity (see paragraph 5).  It is anticipated that shoring the tainter gate and replacing the trunnion will occur from accessing the downstream side.  Partially filling the stilling basin with gravel for crane access may be acceptable.  Other means submitted by the Contractor will be considered.   <br>      <br>   5.	Bridge.  As part of the work plan that shall be approved prior to starting work, the contractor shall provide the pattern and magnitude of loads imposed by the specific crane they plan to use for all expected lifting conditions required for the work and permit load rating calculations in accordance with AASHTO MBE to ensure they do not exceed the capacity of the bridge. The minimum recommended permit live load factor is 1.4, the minimum impact factor is 1.0, and the capacity of the bridge shall account for the bottom flange width reduction of 1-inch as noted in the calculations.  The loading configurations and calculations are required to be submitted for USACE approval to ensure overloading the bridge does not occur.   <br>      <br>   THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT AND/OR REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). This Sources Sought/RFI is for information and planning purposes only as defined by FAR 15.201. The purpose of the posting is to ascertain the breadth of interest and capability of the marketplace to fulfill a specific need.

<DESC>The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District will conduct a Pre-Solicitation Conference for the Mouth of the Columbia River (MCR) South Jetty Dune Augmentation project on 31 January 2013 at Robert Duncan Plaza in Portland, Oregon. The address is:  <br>    <br>  Robert Duncan Plaza  <br>  333 SW First Ave  <br>  Portland, OR 97204  <br>    <br>  All interested potential Prime Contractors in NAICS 237990 and Subcontractors in any related NAICS are invited to attend. The conference will take place in rooms 3H&J on the 3rd Floor of Robert Duncan Plaza.  <br>    <br>  The conference will begin at 10:00 AM. This Pre-Solicitation conference is for informational purposes only and is intended to give interested contractors an overview of the size, scope, and timeline of the project. The official solicitation is scheduled to be issued in May 2013.  <br>    <br>  Attendees are required to pre-register for the conference by emailing David Boone, Contract Specialist at david.c.boone@usace.army.mil.   <br>    <br>  Include the following information in the text of the email:   <br>    <br>  1. Individual attendee full name  <br>  2. Individual attendee email address  <br>  3. Company Name  <br>  4. Company CAGE Code  <br>  5. Telephone number  <br>    <br>  In the e-mail subject line, please include  quote mark Registration for MCR South Jetty Dune Augmentation Pre-Solicitation Conference quote mark . Any changes to the time, date, or location will be posted on FedBizOpps.gov as a modification to this Special Notice. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reserves the right to reduce the number of attendees per company should space availability present an issue. Please monitor this FedBizOpps.gov posting for any updates. <br>  <br>  <br> A dynamic revetment (cobble/gravel berm) will be constructed along the ocean side of the foredune (south of the south jetty) and will be approximately 1,100 linear feet. Construction of the dynamic revetment will occur within the Fort Stevens State Park.  The dynamic revetment will be constructed within an active coastal zone, where the water level during times of high tide or storm wave action may affect the work area.  Construction activity is anticipated to be initiated within the time frame of AUG - OCT 2013. <br>  <br> The foundation grade for the dynamic revetment will be located at approximately +8 ft NAVD. Mean Higher High tide is at +8.5 ft NAVD. Approximately 18,000 cy of sand may need to be excavated to meet the required foundation elevation for placement of material. Note the sand excavation will occur incrementally as the dynamic revetment is constructed in 100-200 ft long segments.  In this case, the volume of sand expected to be excavated per 100-ft revetment segment is approximately 185 cy. <br>  <br> Rounded cobble material will be required for the majority of the material. Between 30,000 to 50,000 cy of material will be placed total in three separate layers. A 2-foot bottom bedding filter consisting of  -inch minus gravels will be placed at foundation grade.  A core material (either angular or rounded) will be placed on top of the bedding and range from 1 to 12 inches in size. Rounded cobble will be placed at the toe of the berm to dissipate wave energy. A final layer of rounded cobble will be placed on top of the core material ranging in size from 1 to 8 inches in size, well graded. The constructed template crest would have a crest height of between 10 to 15 feet above the foundation grade and have a 1 vertical to 5 horizontal slope aspect from crest to existing grade. <br>  <br> Once construction is complete, the excavated sand will be placed at the toe of the structure to preserve the existing grade at the time of construction, any remaining sand will be used to supplement low spots in the foredune crest.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI.  Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  At this time, questions concerning the composition and requirements for a future Request for Proposal (RFP) will not be entertained.  <br>    <br>  The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) and the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center (AFHSC)/Department of Defense (DoD) Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (DoD-GEIS) are conducting market research to ascertain the availability of small business concerns that have proven capabilities to provide Avian Influenza/Pandemic Influenza (AI/PI) and Other Emerging Disease Surveillance.   The AFHSC and DoD-GEIS requires support to establish the infrastructure and capabilities necessary to enable detection and analyses of disease outbreaks and respond to inquiries from the medical/health authorities from the three military service medical departments, Federal medical agencies, and other DoD-associated activities.  The AFHSC and DoD-GEIS are expected to be able to analyze, interpret, and disseminate information regarding the status, trends, and determinants of the health and fitness of U.S. Armed Forces members and other target populations, and enable surveillance activities in support of host nations that are of mutual interest to the medical surveillance activities of the respective nations.  This requires obtaining and analyzing information received during the conduct of routine lab-based and record based surveillance activities as well as study project-specific epidemiologic data collection in support of outbreak investigations and/or other epidemiologic studies conducted among DoD beneficiary and civilian populations.  <br>    <br>  Please review the attached document, section 4.0 for response instructions.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR THE EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:  This is an exception to the fair opportunity process.  The Naval Medical Logistics Command, acting on behalf of U.S. Naval Fleet, multiple hulls, intends to award a delivery order against Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract SPM2D1-09-D8339.        

2.  NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF CONTRACT ACTION:  The proposed acquisition is for four (4) M-Turbo Portable Ultrasound Systems, accessory transducers and mobile stands manufactured by Sonosite, Inc. 21919 30th Drive SE, Bothell, WA  98021.  The Government intends on awarding a Firm Fixed Price delivery order.

3.
  DESCRIPTION OF REQUIRED SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  The U.S. Navy Fleet, multiple hulls, has a need for four (4) Portable Ultrasound Systems. The item shall be a U.S. FDA market approved, portable ultrasound system capable of providing imaging of the abdomen, pelvis, chest, head, neck, eyes, heart, breast, extremities and intracranial; be capable of scanning from a cold start within 25 seconds; operate in 2-D real time, M-Mode; provide color Doppler, power Doppler and duplex color capability; include at a minimum, the following biopsy compatible transducers or probes capable of supporting Multi-Beam Imaging and technology for reducing speckle noise and enhancing resolution: Curved or sector array capable of under 5.0 MHz, Linear Array capable of 7.0 MHz (Threshold) or 10.0 MHz (Objective) or higher, Endo-Cavitary probe supporting Obstetrical and Gynecologic examinations, and a Phased array to support cardiac examinations; have an LCD display adjustable for light and brightness of at least 10 inches measured diagonally; have a digital scan converter shall have at least a 512 X 512 NTSC matrix with a display of at least 256 grayscale levels; perform zoom and freeze frame image capture manipulations; be capable of transmitting static and dynamic images with calculation and demographic data via USB or DICOM 3 ports;  have at a minimum 8 GB of on-board memory to retain data from examinations, still frames and reports; have at a minimum a single caliper measurement for obstetrical and gynecological examinations with OB/GYN application specific calculations; have the ability to be upgradeable with application-specific calculations for Cardiac, Vascular and Intima-Media Thickness; be operable on 100-120 VAC, 60 Hz  input and  rechargeable battery; operable on battery power at minimum settings for at least two hours; with the exception of any accessory cart, stand or transducer, not weigh more than 10 pounds with battery; with the exception of any accessory cart, stand or transducer, not exceed two cubic feet; have applications training be included with teaching modules on CD-Rom or DVD; have documentation including user and OEM service manual(s) included on CD-Rom; include vendor installation, use and maintenance training at locations within CONUS; not require proprietary tools or equipment to repair or set-up the system; withstand a drop test of at least 3 feet; be impervious to damage secondary to contact from spills, gel or bodily fluids; have at a minimum a four year warranty that includes the use of a loaner system while repairs are being conducted.
  The mobile stand shall accommodate the portable ultrasound system; be height adjustable; have at least four transducer holders; shall incorporate a docking station that allows connection of the ultrasound system to an external monitor via a DVI connection; have locking casters.     

FY 13 O&MN SERP funds in the amount of $198,127.20 will be used to procure these Ultrasound Systems.

4.  IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE AND/OR DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS:   The statutory authority exception to the fair opportunity process is implemented by 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii), only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized.

The Sonosite M-Turbo is the only product that provided the multi-discipline capabilities of ultrasound imaging for the abdomen, pelvis, chest, head, neck, eyes, heart, breast, extremities and intracranial area in one product that met the size, weight, shock and ingress requirements.
  This item will not only be used in the casualty receiving and operating areas of the ships, but will also be required to be rapidly transported to remote Battle Dressing Stations, and battle or accident sites where sailors may be trapped or crushing injuries may be present.  The need for an extremely portable ultrasound unit is required to assess internal bleeding and vascular integrity to determine transportability or the need for emergency amputation.  This requires a unit that is not only light, but extremely compact, have extended battery operation and withstand a shipboard environment that may be influenced by heavy seas and combat action.  The Sonosite M-Turbo is the only system meeting all requirements of the essential characteristics.

Sonosite, Inc is the sole manufacturer of the M Turbo Ultrasound System.
  It is currently used across DoD for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Marine Corps for forward deployed Level 2 & 3 medical capability.  It is imperative that interoperability of this equipment be maintained between the services in forward deployed units supporting combat operations in a variety of theaters.  Interoperability supports the sharing of compatible transducers, repair parts, maintenance support and software upgrades to enable the highest possible level of emergency care and operational readiness.  

This is a Life Saving/Life Support piece of equipment used to externally examine for vascular function and damage, intracranial abnormalities, obstetrical evaluation, internal bleeding, cardiac anomalies, muscular-skeletal deformities, etc.
  The system and associated transducers need to be at the ready at all times with the ability to rapidly be brought back on line in the event of a malfunction.  As the predominant portable ultrasound unit for Level 2 & 3 medical units, the equipment and transducers would be interchangeable across all forward deployed theaters.  Procurement of any other device would require the development of entirely new supply/support packages that would be applicable to only the platforms for this solicitation.  If forward deployed and in dire need of a specific transducer or a functioning system, the platform could not rely on a locally deployed unit which would increase the likelihood of loss of life or limb.
 


5.  DETERMINATION OF BEST VALUE:  DLA has already determined the prices of equipment on the IDIQ as fair and reasonable.  The Contracting Officer shall make a determination of best value for the Government before a delivery order is executed.

6.  DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH:  Market research was conducted in the December 2012, based off of an extensive product comparison conducted in 2010 by the DoD Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO), a 2011 review of the latest ECRI product comparisons, an updated review of the latest 2012 ECRI comparisons, review of existing DLA Troop Support contracts and review of manufacturer websites.  A DMMPO comparison of 14 products from:  B-K Medical, Dymax, Esaote, Direct Medical System, G.E.
 Healthcare, Medison, Mindray, Shantou Institute, Shimadzu, Siemens Medical, Sonosite, Terason, Toshiba and Zonare indicated that the Sonosite M Turbo was the only product to satisfy the essential characteristics required by DoD for level 2 & 3 medical units in forward deployed theaters and U.S. Navy combat ships.  The 2012 ECRI comparisons revealed a new model from GE Healthcare not previously reviewed, but was included in this new market research.  The 2012 ECRI comparisons indicated 35 FDA market approved models from 11 different vendors.  While a number of vendors manufacture various lines of portable ultrasound systems, the majority of system capabilities are limited to specific specialties rather than a system that comprises capability across a multitude of specialties.
  Other vendors, who manufacture a system with wider capabilities, could not keep the system in a compact size with the minimum 10 inch LCD screen, meet the minimum 10 pound weight restriction or meet the drop test and ingress protection requirements for use on U.S. Navy combat ships. 

While a number of vendors manufacture various lines of portable ultrasound systems, the majority of system capabilities are limited to specific specialties rather than a system that comprises capability across a multitude of specialties.  Other vendors, who manufacture a system with wider capabilities, could not keep the system in a compact size with the minimum 10 inch LCD screen, meet the minimum 10 pound weight restriction or meet the drop test and ingress protection requirements for use on U.S.
 Navy combat ships.  The Sonosite M-Turbo is the only product that fulfilled all the requirements of paragraph 3.  

7.  ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS:    Previous awards for this item:

- SPM2D1-09-D-8339-0016, 05 Feb 2010, $56,482.50.
- SPM2D1-09-D-8339-N029, 22 Aug 2011, $247,659.00.
- SPM2D1-09-D-8339-N031, 25 Jan 2012, $49,531.80.

8.  ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMPETITION:  Future procurements will be done in accordance with FAR 16.505.
