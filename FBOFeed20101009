<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Afghanistan District, North (AEN) has a critical need for K-Span Buildings.<BR>The Contractor must construct large and small structures using the K-Span metal building system. Building types include Headquarters Buildings, Barracks, Dining Facilities, Training Buildings, Warehouses, Vehicle Maintenance Buildings, Medical Clinics, and Latrines.<BR><BR>The K-span metal buildings shall be constructed according site-adapt drawings provided by the US government.<BR><BR>Building foundations and slab-on-grade concrete floors shall be provided as an integral design with the K-Span metal building system. Sidewalls shall be vertical K-span panels, arched K-span panels and vertical masonry walls, as shown in the site-adapt drawings. Interior partitions shall be CMU. The structure shall be insulated with flame-resistant spray foam. The ceiling system shall be seismically braced suspended gypsum wall board.<BR><BR>The K-span metal building system consists of a self-contained, metal building manufacturing plant, known as the ABM 120 System/Automatic Building Machine 120. This machine is mounted on a trailer, forming a mobile factory that can be towed to remote construction sites. For larger buildings a version of the ABM 120 is known as the UBM 240/ Ultimate Building Machine 240 shall be used.  It can use heavier coil stock and is a larger version of the ABM 120. An important aspect of both machines is that they can be transported by air anywhere in the world. The ABM/UBM System has been certified for air transport by the U.S. Air Force in C-130, C-141, and C-5 aircraft. Once the machine is delivered on site, it can be set up and turn coils of steel into structural strength arched panels. The panels are then machine seamed together to form an economical and watertight steel structure. The final shape and strength of the materials used eliminates the need for columns, beams, or any other type of interior structural support. All of the panel-to-panel connections are joined using an electric automatic seaming machine. There are no nuts, bolts, or other type of fastener. Once delivered to the jobsite, the on-site manufacturing abilities of the machine give the ABM/UBM operator complete control of fabrication and quality of the building. Training key personnel in the operation of all related K-span equipment is essential. <BR><BR>Contractors with the capabilities listed above should respond as early as possible.  The point of contact for this action is J.W. Purcell, who may be reached at James.W.Purcell@usace.army.mil.<BR><BR><BR>
