<p>5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen, <br />Kim Diercks<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-2379<br />email: kim.diercks@usafa.af.mil</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has a requirement to support the reintroduction of salmonids to the San Joaquin River. The specifications of the receivers and transmitters (size, frequency in kHz, and transmitter battery life) are necessary to determine survival of juveniles through the system and will be long term monitoring. It is very important that the receiver equipment be able to preform in very low frequency.  As authorized by parts 12 and 13 (especially 13.106-1(b)) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR Chapter 1), we intend to purchase these requirements from Vemco, Div of which we believe is the only responsible source reasonably available to provide them because the receivers are developed by VEMCO (180kHz) are the lowest frequency receiver with the small tag size needed for tagging juvenile salmonids and have a long battery life. The tags also work and can detect with the VEMCO VR-100 mobile hydrophone which is already owned by USFWS which provides mobile tracking.This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Any other interested organizations must submit a written statement of their capabilities and qualifications to fulfill this requirement to the identified point of contact as soon as possible, but not later then 12:00 p.m. local time on February 28, 2011. Any such statements of capabilities and qualifications received by the deadline will be evaluated soley for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to complete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has a requirement to support the reintroduction of salmonids to the San Joaquin River. The specifications of the receivers and transmitters (size, frequency in kHz, and transmitter battery life) are necessary to determine survival of juveniles through the system and will be long term monitoring. It is very important that the receiver equipment be able to preform in very low frequency.  As authorized by parts 12 and 13 (especially 13.106-1(b)) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR Chapter 1), we intend to purchase these requirements from Vemco, Div of which we believe is the only responsible source reasonably available to provide them because the receivers are developed by VEMCO (180kHz) are the lowest frequency receiver with the small tag size needed for tagging juvenile salmonids and have a long battery life. The tags also work and can detect with the VEMCO VR-100 mobile hydrophone which is already owned by USFWS which provides mobile tracking.This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Any other interested organizations must submit a written statement of their capabilities and qualifications to fulfill this requirement to the identified point of contact as soon as possible, but not later then 12:00 p.m. local time on February 28, 2011. Any such statements of capabilities and qualifications received by the deadline will be evaluated soley for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to complete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from ATK Launch Systems, Inc., Huntsville SpaceOperations (HSO) on a sole source basis. ATK is the only known contractor with personnelcertified to operate MSFCs Plasma Torch machine. NASA has used ATK as the solecontractor to conduct Plasma Torch testing for 15+ years, and ATK has extensiveexperience in manufacturing, logistics, and test support for the unique test specimensand equipment. ATK certified personnel have developed a unique knowledge that will enablethem to properly and safely operate the Plasma Torch and conduct the testing to meet allof NASAs requirements. Utilizing the same equipment/operators for this insulationmaterial characterization would allow NASA to correlate any new data generated with theexisting historical testing of baseline materials which would decrease the amount oftesting and the amount of equipment verification required.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon March 8, 2011.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) has a requirement for Repair of Repairable (ROR) Effort for the Department of the Navy Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (DoN LAIRCM) program. NAVAIR plans to award a sole source delivery order under NAVAIR BOA N00019-08-G-0012 to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, Electronic Systems, Land and Self Protection Systems Division, Rolling Meadows, IL for supplies and services required to plan, manage and execute the repair/overhaul of AN/AAQ-24(V)25 DoN LAIRCM repairable assets. The requirement is for complete repair/overhaul of unserviceable AN/AAQ-24(V)25 components to a serviceable condition. The component Part Numbers P/N(s) are as follows: Control Interface Unit (Part Number 001-007678-103, cage code 26916), Guardian Laser Transmitter Assembly (Part Number 001-008065A401, cage code 26916), Processor (Part Number 001-007722-2101, cage code 26916) and Infrared Missile Warning Sensor (Part Number 001-008087-0005, cage code 26916).
<p>The AN/AAQ-24(V)25 component repair and overhaul comprises majority of the work load and shall be accomplished in accordance with the latest version of Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, Electronics Systems, Land and Self Protection Systems Division repair procedures, technical manuals, specifications, or instructions. The restored AN/AAQ-24(V)25 components will be returned to supply system stock or issued for immediate Fleet use. The Government lacks the drawings and technical data to permit competitive repair of the AN/AAQ-24(V)25 components listed precedingly. Drawings and data are proprietary to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, Electronics Systems, Land and Self Protection Systems Division. A Product Verification Audit (PVA) may be required for prospective sources.</p>
<p>This effort is being awarded on a sole source basis to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, Electronic Systems, Land and Self Protection Systems Division, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 because Northrop Grumman is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the equipment addressed in this synopsis and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>This is not a request for either a quote or proposal, or an invitation for bid.  The intent of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to notify potential offerors of the Navys requirement under RFP N40084-11-R-0004, for a Design-Build Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Construction Contract at US Navy Support Facility, Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT).  The project will be solicited as an unrestricted procurement using the source selection procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15.101 and 15.3.  The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures which require offerors to submit price and technical proposals.  Evaluation of proposals will be based on price and technical evaluation factors, as stated in the solicitation, with contract award to be made to the offeror submitting the best value to the Government.
  The contract resulting from this solicitation will result in contract award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is determined to be the most advantageous to the US Government, considering price and technical evaluation factors.  The work includes, but is not limited to, labor, supervision, tools, materials and equipment necessary to perform new construction, repair, and/or alteration of existing infrastructure.  The contract period of performance is anticipated to consist of a twelve-month Base Period and two twelve-month Option Periods, for a total maximum duration of thirty-six months.  The estimated maximum dollar value, including the Base Period and both Option Periods is $90,000,000.
  The minimum task order limitation will be established at $150,000, with an unspecified maximum task order amount.  The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the Government through issuance of a task order.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered; however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $10,000,000 is guaranteed to be ordered under the performance period of the contract.  The minimum guarantee may be met by the issuance of a task order during the Base Period or Option Periods.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  There are no additional minimum guarantees obligated for each Option year.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with an annual size standard of $33.5M.
  At the time of proposal, interested parties must consist of a Joint-Venture effort between a United States firm (minimum 60%) and a United Kingdom firm (minimum 20%).  Anticipate a one-time pre-proposal conference and site visit on or about the last week of March 2011/first week of April 2011 in Diego Garcia, which will be restricted to registered planholder firms only.  Due to the logistical constraints posed by the location, each firm will be allowed only three attendees on the site visit.  Each request must include the following information: full name, gender, citizenship, nationality, name of firm being represented, position/title, social security number, complete company and home address, passport number (place of issuance, date of issue, expiration date), and e-mail address(es).
  Due to the lead time required for visitors to receive area clearance to Diego Garcia, it is imperative that each firm provide the above information to the Contracting Officer within 5 business days from receipt of the Request for Proposal (RFP). It is the responsibility of the planholder to arrange for transportation to Singapore.  A Government-sponsored MAC flight will be available to transport planholders from Paya Lebar, Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) Base, Singapore, to Diego Garcia. It is highly recommended that flight arrangements to Singapore allow for significant flexibility in the event that the scheduled MAC flight becomes delayed or encounters unscheduled changes. Failure to submit all required information by the date to be determined at the time of the issuance of the RFP will preclude the firm's eligibility to participate in the site visit and pre-proposal conference.
  No additional names will be accepted after the registration deadline.

Interested offerors can view and/or download the solicitation from Asia Navy Electronic Commerce Online at https://asia.neco.navy.mil when it becomes available on or around the third week of March 2011.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>R-1.  CONTRACT INFORMATION:  Up to Two Indefinite Delivery A-E Contracts may be awarded for Commissioning Authority (CxA) services, sustainable engineering services, and LEED Accredited Professional services for a period of one year with an option to extend the contract up to four additional years.  The contract(s) will be for new construction and major renovation projects primarily within the Albuquerque District boundaries (Southern Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and Southwest Texas) with work possible within the South Pacific Division (California, Nevada and Utah).   Work may also be performed outside these areas.  The contract(s) will be procured in accordance with Pl 92-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and FAR Part 36.  Work will be negotiated and initiated by issuance of delivery orders, which will not exceed $9,000,000 over the life of each contract.  The anticipated award date is May 2011.  This procurement is unrestricted.  Where the Government has multiple Indefinite Delivery Contracts for identical services, delivery orders will be issued to the various firms based on similar project experience, expertise, workload, and performance on previous projects, with the intent to equally distribute the work.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under this contract must be no less than those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act.    In accordance with Public Law 95-707, large business firms are reminded that a subcontracting plan will be required which provides for subcontracting work to small and small disadvantaged firms to the maximum extent practicable, if any of the work is to be subcontracted.  The Albuquerque District goal is for 50% of the subcontracted dollars to go to small business with the percentage of those dollars distributed as follows: 17% to small disadvantaged business, 18% to woman owned business, 10% to HUB-zone small business, 8.5% veteran-owned small business and 4% service disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB).  To be eligible for contract award, a firm or Joint Venture must be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the Internet Site at www.ccr.gov.   2. PROJECT INFORMATION:   The work may include CxA services, sustainable engineering support services and LEED Project Administrator services for new construction and major renovation projects.

<a href="mailto:kelly.mcgirr@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Acquisition and Logistics, Contracting Office, Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), located at 260 Industrial Way West, Eatontown, NJ 07724 intends to enter into a contract on a basis of other than full and open competition for the Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) Region 4.  The TAC intends to award a sole source Firm-Fixed-Priced (FFP) contract to SunGard Availability Services Limited Partnership (LP), 680 East Swedesford Road, Wayne, PA.  

This action is in direct support of Federal continuity of operations (COOP) requirements that state every Federal agency is required to plan for continuous performance of essential functions and operations in the event of an emergency. This is stated in the Federal Preparedness Circular 65, which is reinforced by the National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-51 and Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-20.   Veterans Healthcare is specifically cited as an essential Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) function. Therefore, the Office of Information & Technology (OI&T) Region 4 has stood up two (2) data centers (one, a VA owned data center  located in Brooklyn and the other comprised of the aforementioned split locations in Philadelphia under SunGard) that ensure all essential Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) operations are always functioning. The SunGard facilities are currently Certified and Accredited (C&A) by VA as operational data centers in support of clinical operations throughout the region. C&A is a process that ensures that systems and major applications adhere to formal and established security requirements that are well documented and authorized. C&A is required by the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002. All systems and applications that reside on U.S. Government networks must go through a formal C&A process before being put into production, and every three years thereafter. Since accreditation is the ultimate output of a C&A initiative, and a system or application cannot be accredited unless it meets specific security guidelines, the goal of C&A is to force federal agencies to put into production systems and applications that are secure. Additionally, C&A is a lengthy and costly process. Additional space at an existing VA data center location can leverage the existing C&A, thereby avoiding the duplication of cost and delivery delays.  The SunGard facility originally was developed solely for the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 3 network and has now expanded to cover the entire OI&T Region 4 and continues to expand with a need for renewal of support services for the existing 2,875 square feet as well as an additional 2,500 square feet of floor space, power, heating, ventilation and cooling (HVAC) and support services to be acquired under this effort.  A critical technical configuration necessitates that redundant failover data centers must be located within a relatively close proximity to one another in order to ensure latency and data transfer rates meet VA's requirements. In order to achieve synchronous data replication between geographically separate data centers and maintain high availability access, the VA requires a latency not to exceed 4 milliseconds.  This means that in the expected configuration, a data center pair must be within 25 to 50 miles of each other. The current data centers host critical clinical applications, such as VistA, which require seamless support in order to ensure continuity of operations to the Veterans Health Administration.  Providing seamless support requires that two separate data centers are always functioning simultaneously, thus providing data redundancy in the event that one center goes offline.  
 
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) for this effort is 541513.

This notification shall close on Monday, February 28, 2011.  All responsible sources may submit a response which shall be considered by the agency.  Questions/responses shall be submitted via e-mail to Contract Specialist, Kelly McGirr, Kelly.mcgirr@va.gov, with the subject line as the synopsis number, VA118-11-RQ-0170.  The Points of Contact (POCs) for this action are Kelly McGirr, Contract Specialist, 732-578-5560 or Kevin Loesch, Contracting Officer, 732-578-5487.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing a "market search" for large and small businesses in preparation for a future procurement.
The EPA has need for a contractor to provide analytical laboratory support for the Office of Water, Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water, technical Support Center (TSC) at the Andrew W. Breidenbach Environmental Research Center (AWBERC) in Cincinnati, Ohio.  The principal objective of the TSC is to assure that the drinking water provided to all Americans is of sufficient quality to protect the public health.
To be considered a potential source, a firm must demonstrate they are able to provide the necessary personnel and services to support the effort delineated by the Performance Work Statement. (PWS)  Important components of the activities to be performed to support TSC's objective are the operation of an on-site chemical and microbiological laboratory.  Services to be performed include: conduct development and testing of measurement methods to determine sensitivity, selectivity, reliability, accuracy, precision and quality assurance and control;  perform chemical and microbiological analyses of water samples using written methods, and "state of the art" instrumentation and equipment; conduct analyte preservation studies; collect ship, and receive filled samples; conduct both limited and national microbiological and chemical occurrences surveys; design and implementation both a rigorous quality assurance and quality control program for all contractor's activities subject to the  inspection of the Project officer; make technical presentations to visitors at the TSC laboratory; and provide statistical support in areas related to the work of the contract.
The successful contractor shall provide all necessary labor, materials, and services in support of the efforts.  A draft PWS can be obtained from the OAM website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/. It is anticipated that the contract will be a Firm Fixed Price Contract starting in August 2011 with a one year Base Period and four Optional Periods of 12 months each.  Approximately 17,000 LOE hours are anticipated for each contract period.  The applicable NAICS code is 541380 with a size standard of $12,000,000.  
Any interested firm should submit information which demonstrates the firm's ability to perform the key requirements described above.  Standard company brochures alone will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.   The information should include: size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified Hubzone, 8(a), women-owned, small disadvantaged and/or service disabled veteran owned small business concern, point of contact, telephone number, email and interest in proposing on the solicitation when issued.  
The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses if it determines that there are two or more small businesses able to compete in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery.  If set aside, a small business would be required to perform at least 50 percent of the direct labor costs incurred under the contract with its own personnel (FAR 52.219-14).  Capability statements from small businesses should address their ability to meet this requirement.  Responses to the above should be submitted to Donna Reinhart, USEPA, 26 West Martin Luther King Dr., Cincinnati, OH 45268, or reinhart.donna@epa.gov  no later than March 8, 2011.

<DESC>DHS is committed to using cutting-edge technologies and scientific talent in its quest to make America safer. DNDO's mission is to improve the nation's capability to detect and report unauthorized attempts to import, possess, store, develop, or transport nuclear or radiological material for use against the nation, and to further enhance this capability over time. The Red Team and Net Assessments (RTNA) Directorate supports this effort through evaluating the overall effectiveness of implemented PRND capabilities using workshops, expert elicitation, modeling, program assessments, covert testing, and open source and adversarial red teaming. As RTNA improves its capabilities and its understanding of non-state adversaries, it is increasingly looked to for support by other DNDO directorates, DHS components, and external agencies. RTNA and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) have developed the PEM, which provides a suite of analytic tools for assessing the risk of radiological and nuclear terrorism. This RFI requests information on capabilities associated with providing modeling and simulation, radiological/nuclear detector, operational, and analytic expertise needed for conducting IV&amp;V of the PEM suite.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), Systems Engineering and Evaluation (SE&amp;E) Directorate is in the process of implementing a joint program, the Illicit Trafficking Radiation Assessment Program+10 (ITRAP+10), with the European Commission, Directorate-General Joint Research Centre (JRC). The purpose of ITRAP+10 is to conduct an evaluation and comparison of the performance of available radiation detection equipment relevant to nuclear security. The results will provide an independent assessment of available radiation detection equipment on the market which will serve as a reference for regulatory and other authorities to identify equipment and or families of equipment to address their particular needs, and potentially help to ensure common standards on an international level. The overall scope of this project is to assist organizations in effectively detecting radioactive materials nationally and crossing borders illegally, whether importations, exportations, or shipments in transit, and by developing recommendations that describe the technical and functional requirements for the selection of radiation detection equipment so that resources are deployed in an efficient way.
<p>DNDO is seeking information on all categories of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) systems designed for radiological/nuclear monitoring instruments that can be used at and inside the borders by law enforcement agencies.<br /><br />All questions and responses for this RFI should be sent via email to DNDOITRAP@dhs.gov. Responses are due no later than 4:30 PM (Eastern Time) on 14 December 2010. Questions and responses sent to any other email address will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Acquisition Operations Group, Denver, Colorado, intends to award a contract on a sole-source basis to SureWorks, LLC, 618 Teal Circle, Suite 1B, Longmont, CO 80501. This ongoing research and development requirement is for software/electrical engineering support to fully develop a computerized panel display with touch panel interface for the Tracy Fish Collection Facility Count Station.  Fish species and numbers that are sub-sampled during count station procedures will be entered into a computer database using a computerized panel display with a touch panel interface that will be designed to Tracy Fish Collection Management and Operator specifications. This computerized interface would replace the use of paper record keeping and time spent entering the data into a computer later.  Images of seasonally entrained fishes that one could touch on the screen and enter quantity and provide notes if necessary would streamline the data collection process and provide greater accuracy with less human-related error.  Fish entrainment data will be gathered into Microsoft Excel and PDF documents for reporting and data management along with flow, operational, and facility-related information.  The output will also include automated daily graphs of entrainment and may include some statistical analyses with standard reports.  A fish species classification engine will be implemented to the count station in this third year phase of the contractor and Government research and development efforts.  The end goal of the project is to enable automatic identification and morphometric data of collected fish.  Proprieatry software that is being developed for the SmeltCam fish identification device by SureWorks, LLC. in conjunction with Bureau of Reclamation scientists, will be used for count station fish recognition.  Fish at the Tracy Fish Collection Facility are the same as those encountered during the SmeltCam project on the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.  Awarding to another contractor will result in a substantial duplication of research efforts because another contractor would not have the project-specific knowledge (covers a 4 year period of accumulated research effots), time investment, and inter-governmental agency research networking.   Ongoing information and data has been accumulated from both laboratory and field testing of fish identification software and algorithms which cannot be duplicated.   A final consideration is that the current research and development firm has proprietary rights to their developed software.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will be accepted by e-mail at amanning@usbr.gov, Attention: Ann R. Manning, Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer.  For telephonic inquiries contact (303) 445-2433.  Responses should include the firm's DUN and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for (NAICS) Code 541990 which is $7 Million.  Any response shall be submitted no later than March 8, 2011, 4:00p.m. MST.   This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation for this ongoing research and development project.

Dycoda, LLC, is the only commercially available source that is uniquely qualified to perform the proposed work under this requirement. Dycoda,LLC, is uniquely qualified because Kenneth Wagner is under their employment. Mr. Wagner has been a key personnel on the SOARCA project during the past five years.

Additionally, Mr. Wagner has more than 20 years experience in applying thermal hydraulic codes to severe accident analysis, including SCDAP, RELAP, and MELCOR codes. <br />The work will include but it not limited to:<br />- Re-running the Surry OSLOCA scenario to account for new plant configuration information received from the Surry Plant. <br />- Finalizing the already-started MELCOR analysis for the Surry Plant for SOARCA.<br />- Working to address SOARCA Peer Review Committee comments on SOARCA for Surry.<br />- Working to address NRC comments on SOARCA for Surry.<br />- Presenting work completed for this project at public forums. <br />The period of performance will be nine (9) months from the date of award.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source Requirement

The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, intends to negotiate a sole source contract under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source to Genzyme Biosurgery, as the sole source provider for Seprafilm Adhesion Barrier.  This product is currently the only product which carries FDA approved indications for reduction of adhesions after abdominal surgery, and therefore is the only product approved for use in both abdominal and gynecologic procedures.

A firm fixed price contract with four option years is anticipated and shall be awarded.  It is the Government's belief that only the proposed candidate possesses the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement in a timely and cost effective manner. It is the Government's intention to solicit and negotiate with only this source.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation documents are available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notice to the Contracting Officer within five (5) days from the synopsis publication date. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. This information can be emailed to Heather Simpson at heather.simpson3@va.gov.  Responses will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses of this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

NAICS is 334119 and the size standard is 1000 employees.<br />This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside.<br />This solicitation is for the purchase of (42) forty-two Rugged Modular Enclosures. The minimum salient characteristics the government is requiring are as follows:<br />1)	Dimensions of the frames are 2.00(h), 5.117(L), 5.983(W), 1.339(h), 5.117(L), 5.983(W) and 0.67(h), 5.117(L), 5.983(W).<br />2)	Frame is a machined aluminum modular enclosure acting as a heat sink.  <br />3)	Frame delivers performance from -40 to +85&deg;C without a fan.<br />4)	Frame should be made out of Aluminum Alloy 6061 Chemical Composition Limits (%) - Silicon 0.4-0.8, Iron 0.7, Copper 0.15-0.4, Magnesium 0.8-1.2, Chromium 0.04-0.35, Zinc 0.25, Titanium 0.15, and Aluminum comprises the remainder.<br />5)	The modular stack-through design of the pc 104 architecture allows you to add additional modules or upgrade existing modules as technology or requirements change.<br />6)	Extremely versatile, this heat-treatable alloy combines good weldability and formability, high corrosion resistance, and medium strength.

<DESC>This is a notice of the Government's intent to award a firm-fixed price, commercial contract for the purchase of 5 ea Pre-Conditioned Air Hose Kits. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. All responsible sources may submit a response which, if timely received, must be considered by the agency.
<p>THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT RESULT IN AN ORDER AGAINST AN FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE. ANY OFFER WHICH IS PREDICATED UPON THE AWARD BEING PLACED AGAINST AN FSS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.</p>
<p><br />The purchase of 5 Pre-Conditioned Air Hose Kits, each kit consisting of the following: <br />Each kit of pre-conditioned hoses consist of 10 ea LG hoses, 2 ea female connectors, 1 ea 90 degree elbows, 1 ea 45 degree elbows, 2 ea 10' long double "Y" hoses, w/ end caps, 1 ea 10' long triple "Y" hose w/ end caps, and 2 ea 10' long hoses 6" diameter, C-17 stenciled inside.<br />Mfr: PCA Hose Systems, Inc.<br />JUSTIFICATION FOR SOLE SOURCE:</p>
<p>PCA Hose Systems Inc in the only known source available that has an external patented hook and loop velcro, connection that's at least 6" wide to maintain a stronger grip with distinctive features of a flat hose with edge bindings that keeps the hose from twisting, makes it easier to store, reduce scuffing, increase longevity, prevent damage to aircraft and will not be damaged if driven over. Three part construction of the hoses consist of the outer layer which is an oil resistant, waterproof, 18/20 ounce vinyl coated, 1000 denier polyester fabric. The second layer is open-cell foam and the bottom layer is 420 Denier Nylon coated fabric which is used on air bags, and not by any other hose company. This material prevents aircraft damage caused by flaking and cracking of the inner line and could possible cause health issues. All hoses and connections are independently pressure tested to 50' in water for 5 minutes. Other companies such as AMcraft and J&amp;B Aviation do carry flat hoses but don't have the same type hook and loop connections, thickness of materials and are more time consuming to install. Some are equipped with zipper connections which create extra work to replacements when broken or corroded, and won't maintain a solid air tight grip due to zipper connections. Also PCA Hose Systems are currently used by the F-15 and C-5 squadrons and we need our hoses to match up with there's for conformity. There are times when we will need to trade hoses between each other and they need to be the same in order to connect correctly to the AC units. We will have repair kits for this brand of hoses and they need to be able to work between all squadrons for repair capability.</p>
<p>Only quotes for new, unused equipment will be considered.</p>
<p>Price(s) should be FOB Destination (Robins AFB GA 31098). In addition to price and delivery, quote should include your cage code, DUNS number, and taxpayer ID number. Requested delivery date is 30 days ARO or earlier.</p>
<p>Quotations should be emailed to SSgt James E. Kaari (james.kaari@robins.af.mil) no later than Monday, 07 March 2011, 4:00 pm EST.</p>
<p>The following clauses are applicable to subject solicitation (current through FAC 2005-49 dated 24 Jan 2011, and DFARS Change Notice 20110120):<br /><br />FAR 52.211-6 Brand-Name or Equal<br />FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors<br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items<br />FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items<br />FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items<br />FAR 52-212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, and DFARS 252.212-7001<br />FAR 52.247-34 FOB Destination<br />DFARS 252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation (Appl if unit price exceeds $5K.)<br />DFARS 252.232.7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (WAWF is the method used by DoD for processing invoices/receiving reports.)</p>

FUNDING LIMITATIONS:  The Contractor is responsible for preparing the graphic design alternatives to permit the award of a contract for the fabrication of the graphic designs within the available funding.  The estimated fabrication contract price for this project is $250,000 to $500,000.CONFIDENTIALITY:  The information developed under this contract is the property of the U. S. Government and shall be kept in strict confidence.	PERFORMANCE PERIOD: The work of this contract shall be provided within 112 calendar days from the award date.  	PROJECT IDENTIFICATION:  			PMIS Number:	  62072 		Project Title:     Construct Indian Memorial		Project Location:  Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument, Crow Agency, Montana 		Drawing Number:  381/80,072Drawings, proposed graphic design files, and photographs of the existing memorial are available upon request from the Contracting Officer.
	I.  PROJECT DESCRIPTIONThe Indian Memorial at Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument was constructed in 2002.  It was constructed in a circular configuration with concrete structural walls, and a sandstone masonry veneer finish.  Twelve granite panels were installed for future graphic engraving.  The panels are 10 inches thick, and approximately 44 inches high, and range in width from 78 to 91 inches.  Each panel weighs about 3000 pounds.   The large exposed face of each panel is curved from side to side.   The panels were to have been given a flame-treated finish on the exposed faces.  The impact of the existing finish as it pertains to engraving and/or polishing, especially in the field, shall be evaluatedThe NPS has received proposed graphic designs from the participating tribes.  Some of the proposed designs may require special methods to be engraved in granite, or require alternative media, due to the proposed level of detail, small font sizes, and/or use of color.The proposed graphic designs are disparate in nature.  The final graphic designs shall present a cohesive appearance for the Indian Memorial.   
	II.  SCOPE OF SERVICES1.  Field Evaluation, Including Site Visita. Review of design drawings to determine:i. Intended granite finishes and attachmentsii. Original design intentb. Site visit to confirm current site conditionsi.   Determine/evaluate quantity, finishes and condition of panel surfacesii.  Investigate attachments of the temporary panels (to determine if any restorative work will be required when temporary panels are removed)iii.  Confirm access to the work and impacts for final phase of memorial stone finishing and completion of interpretive panels	iv.  Determine if and to what extent existing panels can be polished and/or engraved in place.	c.  Written report of findings
	2.  Analyze suitability of alternative media for proposed graphic designs		a.   Determine feasibility of executing proposed designs in stoneb.  Verify type size, font and style for consistency across all panels, that can be engraved in-situc.  Verify source material and productions steps for creation of final fabrication files (i.e.	determine if source material is available in high resolution files and/or originals,	determine how much material will need to be re-scanned, re photographed or	typeset in the predominant font)d.  Confirm quantity and sequence of panels 
3.   Investigate applicable graphic and engraving techniques	a. Research and compile a list of techniques for achieving the desired appearance and durability for the finished panels (this list limited to effective techniques determined by the assessment of panels and graphic material)		b.  Written recommendations
	4.  Develop physical prototypes of preferred techniques.  These shall consist of at least 2 items.	a.  A piece of granite at least 1-foot by 2-foot, and at least 1-inch thick, engraved by the same method proposed for in-situ engraving.  This prototype shall demonstrate the proposed text font and style for the in-place granite panels.  The prototype shall have an inlayed panel demonstrating a proposed method of providing greater graphic detail in monochrome form, such as laser-etched granite.	b.  A piece of granite at least 1-foot by 2-foot, and at least 1-inch thick, engraved by the same method proposed for in-situ engraving.  This prototype shall demonstrate the proposed text font and style for the in-place granite panels.  The prototype shall have an inlayed panel demonstrating a proposed method of providing greater graphic detail in color form, such as porcelain enamel on stainless steel.  		c.  Delivery to Little Bighorn Battlefield NM
5.  Create graphic renderings of the finished panels for tribal review		a. Create graphic renderings of the recommended finished panels.	b.  The NPS will set up a 1-day meeting with tribal representatives.  The contractor shall present a summary of findings, recommendations, prototypes, alternatives, and proposed final graphic designs, and answer questions.
6.   Produce final graphic files a. Organize and execute any photography or scanning of necessary originalsb. Typeset all text in appropriate fontc. Organize and archive all graphic and typographical datad. Produce illustrator file(s) for each panel and individual elements as necessary
7.  Produce final fabrication documents & cost estimate (bid option)
III.  PRELIMINARY ALTERNATIVES-The NPS has identified the preliminary alternatives listed below.  Additional alternatives or combinations of alternatives are welcome.1.  Engrave Existing Granite Panels In-Situ-Engrave the proposed designs onto the existing granite panels on site.2.  Fabricate Engraved Granite Overlay Panels (approximately 1.5 inches thick), Install Over Existing Granite Panels-The overlays panels would be engraved in a shop environment.  The engraved granite panels would have a very similar look to engraving the existing granite blocks, except that they would protrude from the walls.  A seam or gap might be visible between the overlay panels and the existing granite blocks.  A possible option might be to grind off 1.5 inches or so of the existing granite blocks in situ, and install the overly panels into the new space.3.  Fabricate Porcelain Enamel Panels, Install Over Existing Granite Panels-This would consist of porcelain enamel paint on a stainless steel backing.  The steel panel (could be more than one steel panel per existing granite panel) would be mounted over the existing granite panels.  The painted panels could be provided with a painted background that simulates the appearance of the granite panels.  4.   Porcelain Enamel Inlay Panels in Conjunction with Engraved Granite Panels-This would be a combination-- using granite engraving where practical, and supplementing with porcelain enamel inlays where necessary to achieve intended graphic designs.  5.  Granite Inlay Panels in Combination with In-Place Engraving-This would consist of routing out sections of the granite panels, inserting shop-fabricated sections of engraved or laser-etched finely detailed, and perhaps contrasting colored, granite inlays.  This could be combined with other methods.

<DESC>USAID/Angola's health program components fit under the Investing in People (IIP) element of the Country Operating Plan. This program works with the Angolan Ministry of Health (MOH) to improve the health status of Angolans though improvements to the quality of service delivery and health systems strengthening activities. Angola is a PEPFAR country, and has seen a significant increase in its HIV/AIDS funding in the last years. The U.S. Government (USG) recently entered into a Partnership Framework with the Government of the Republic of Angola (GRA) to combat HIV/AIDS and developed an implementation plan to support the execution of that framework, taking into account Angola's relatively low HIV prevalence estimated at 2 percent. Under this implementation plan, USAID, in cooperation with CDC and DOD, will implement a wide array of prevention activities to help stem infections and prevent a generalized epidemic as witnessed in neighboring countries. Activities will be concentrated in transport corridors, where prevalence is highest and will include improvements in service provision of voluntary counseling and testing (VCT), condom distribution activities to high risk groups, promoting abstinence and delayed sexual debut messages to youth and services to prevent mother-to-child transmission. The objective of this contract is to provide technical support to the USAID/Angola Health Office for the implementation of integrated and cross-cutting health programs, with an emphasis on family planning/reproductive health, malaria, HIV/AIDS and maternal and child health activities. The Senior Health Advisor will provide technical direction and guidance to USAID-financed activities within the health portfolio. S/he will have broad responsibilities for planning and managing USAID-financed programs including collaborating on strategic planning and activity design, development of program descriptions, oversight of work plan development and activity implementation, periodic review of financial performance, and monitoring and evaluation of programs and activities that contribute to the Mission's health portfolio. The incumbent will collaborate with units of the Government of the Republic of Angola (GRA) that plan and manage health programs, including select departments within the Ministry of Health (MOH) as well as with local and international NGOs and private sector institutions implementing activities in the health sector. The incumbent is a senior technical member of USAID/Angola's Health Office, and shall collaborate closely with other technical teams and their programs. The incumbent must possess a high level of technical expertise in the area of public health, preferably with experience in HIV/AIDS, family planning and/or malaria control, and possess a deep understanding of the social, economic and cultural determinants and implications of infectious disease and epidemics in Angola and neighboring countries.

Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit complete information discussing the same within two (2) calendar days from the day this notice is posted. The information submitted must include a letter from the OEM verifying the offerror is an authorized distributor, and verifying the OEM will supply only genuine OEM parts.<br /><br />EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Past Performance: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and the following, the offeror is required to identify past or current contracts for efforts similar to this requirement. Offerors shall provide the information shown below for at least three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts for the same or similar items. Provide as a minimum the following applicable information for each contract:
<p>a. Contract number, Names of contracting parties or agency, point of contact, specifically the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), including email address and telephone number of these identified individuals.<br />b. Ship name, hull type, length, and displacement.<br />c. Type of availability (dry dock, dockside, etc.) and where performed;<br />d. Original contract commencement and completion dates, actual commencement and completion dates, and explanation of (i.e. reasons for) schedule slippage/extensions, if any;<br />e. Award price and final contract price (award plus growth), including the total number of growth work changes and scope of these changes. <br /><br />Past Performance will look at relevant experience, responsiveness, resources, quality and consistency of services, customer satisfaction, and management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Price: The total price will be the evaluated price.<br /><br />(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />EVALUATION APPROACH</p>
<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals as deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation technical capability and past performance are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit proposals that will be considered by the agency. Proposals must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Proposal. Proposals must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number. Proposals must be received not later than <br />28 FEB 2011, 11:00 A.M. Local California time. Proposals received after the date and time specified will not be considered. Proposals may be submitted as an attachment to an e-mail addressed to: Brenda.l.lentz@uscg.mil .</p>

<p><br />OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

a.	Contractor to provide 20 aerial infrared photos and CD files of Buildings No. 1, 2, 3, 11, 24 and 29 roofing system.   All infrared2K studies use the following format.

b.	1) Written Overview of the Study itself
 
c.	2) Four up first page, by Building roof shot. All shots are approximately 300' by 300' so small buildings can be combined with larger ones depending upon ICC Operations Mission planning.  This first page features a control daytime photo (JPEG), always in the upper left.  The nighttime Military grade Thermogram, always in the upper right.  The Patent Process IR2K image in the lower Left for easy comparison to the daytime control photo. To complete this 1st page there is a Campus/Building key shot in the lower right with the actual shot framed for reference.

d.	3) The 2nd page is always a Zoomed in shot of the particular roof under examination from the previous 4 up page.  This allows the Building owner to examine their roof in an expanded format.

e.	The balance of the IR2k Roof report then steps through all planned mission shots of your specified Campus rooftops, individually by rooftop, until the entire survey is complete.  This report is delivered to you printed on 130 pound glossy photographic paper, and the same exact same files are also delivered to you upon a CD with full copying/printing rights In summary the Building Owner receives one printed hard copy report and one CD report.

f.	In regard to ICC Option delivery, the rooftop AutoCAD arrives approximately two weeks after the delivery of the hard copy and CD IR2k report.  It will be indexed and sequenced in the exact same manner as the hard Copy reports.  A Building Owner receives both a printed AutoCAD of the individual Rooftop and a CD with the AutoCAD layers with full printing/copying rights.
  
g.	If a Scaled report is ordered for the initial IR2K Study all subsequent ICC Options are then available to a Building owner, i.e., Rooftop AutoCAD, Geo-Spatial Campus mapping into AutoCAD, and X-ref embedding of the rooftop AutoCAD into Geo-Spatial Site Plan AutoCAD.  Scaling is a prerequisite for all of these Options and IC's Scaling is to AIA standards, i.e., for rooftops Scaling is generally between 1" = 20' and 1" = 50' depending upon building size, while for Campus Site Plan AutoCAD the Scale is generally 1" = 100' up to 1" = 150.'

h.	As you know, the Bonham, VA has requested (20) specified JPEG daytime shots of the Bonham, VA Campus.  ICC will provide these for the same price as our Campus mapping into AutoCAD.  We will also provide the daytime JPEG imagery of your Bonham Campus in one large viewable Campus JPEG.  This custom option does NOT include the mapping of the entire Bonham Campus into AutoCAD layers. Additionally, ICC will provide these custom JPEG shots based upon the Bonham VA's specification.  For each planned shot ICC will require; 1) Helicopter Elevation 2) shot direction, such as east shooting to the West 3) the building(s) to be included in each shot, or "Full Campus" to be specified.

i.	MOISTURE IN LOW SLOPE ROOFING AND SCALED CAMPUS SITE-PLAN SURVEY

j.	Infrared Camera must meet or exceed the following specifications: spectral sensitivity with a range from 3-5 microns, focal plan array detector of at least 320 X 240 InSb elements, thermal sensitivity of < 0.10 degrees Celsius.  Infrared Camera Equipment that shall be deemed acceptable for the purposes of this survey shall include; FLIR Corporation's - Ultra 7500, FLIR - MilCAM RECON, FLIR - DS, INDIGO Corporation's Indigo - Merlin, or INDIGO -Phoenix.

k.	Daytime Digital Control imagery and Nighttime Aerial Infrared Thermographic imagery must be taken from a data collection "platform" moving at no more than 10 miles per hour and at an altitude between 500 feet minimum and 700 feet maximum above the structure being surveyed.  Data Capture platform shall move along and above the building's centerline with no more than a 15 degree deviation from vertical on all thermographic imagery.

l.	All thermographic data shall be captured at night and must be digitally computer processed and digitally computer enhanced with false positives removed prior to digital computer analysis for moisture penetration identification of areas as small as 2 square feet.  Further analysis by an Industry Certified Thermograher shall take place following the application of the preceding processes to the raw data.

m.	All processed nighttime thermograms shall be overlaid and/or married upon a daytime photograph of the same building structure to enable accurate registration of the indications of sub-membrane moisture.

n.	Manual/Analog (Hand) transfer of thermographic data to a rectified daytime control image is NOT an acceptable process for the purposes of performing the work noted within this bid specification.  Simple importing of relevant images into a computer or the use of Photoshop to clean smeared data images does not meet the specification of utilizing a software analysis program calibrated to specifically analyze thermographic images in order to identify sub-membrane moisture.  

o.	False Positives shall be removed from the Infrared imagery by utilizing a Moisture Analyst with more than 5 years of experience in the analysis of roof thermographic data for purposes of moisture delineation.

p.	All finished reports must be provided in a 6" X 8" computer processed and analyzed format of each 50,000-60,000 square foot, or less, section.  The locations of thermal anomalies consistent with distinguishing between wet and dry insulation shall be delineated.  All probable areas of moisture must be clearly indicated in shades of red or another color.  The report shall also include daytime photographs of the same structures and an enlarged, fully moisture analyzed infrared image of each roof or roof section.

q.	Two sets of all finished reports shall be provided in each of the following formats: 

Letter-size, loose leaf bound, full color on heavy gloss, 7 mil photographic paper stock, or equivalent.PDF and DWG files saved on a Compact Disc.

r.	 All processed imagery shall be scaled in accordance with industry standard practices, such as 1" = 50'-0", or less.  Roofs larger than 60,000 square feet shall be sectioned into report areas of less than 60,000 square feet with the maximum allowable deviation on all scaled imagery of less than 2%.  It is the contractor's responsibility to secure all building dimensions upon which report scaling will be conducted.  

s.	A North indicator and key shall be included on each processed image.  
All final reporting must meet or exceed ASTM guideline C1153-99 (American Society for Testing & Materials: Standard Practice for Location of Wet Insulation in Roofing Systems using Infrared Imaging).

t.	AutoCAD reports shall be provided on all surveyed rooftops in DWG file format.  Separate AutoCAD layers for the rooftop information shall include the following: all anomalous moisture intrusions; vents, ducts, pipes, HVAC units, and other identifiable planned penetrations of the roof-top.  A separate AutoCAD file shall be provided for each rooftop greater than 60,000 square feet and/or divided into multiple reports.  Each AutoCAD report must include an analysis of the total square feet of each rooftop, the square feet of anomalies, and the percentage of anomalies in the report section.

u.	Scaled campus site plan surveys that clearly and accurately define the spatial AutoCAD layers and colors.  Plans shall be provided in the DWG file format and saved on a CD which also includes the imagery taken of each campus.  Building Owner shall have the unrestricted right and ability to produce unlimited quantities of prints or images from each scaled campus site plan.  The maximum allowable deviation on all scaled imagery shall be less than 2%.

v.	All reports and imagery must be delivered and explained to Building Owner staff by an experienced representative at a campus location to be specified.  ICC's representative shall be available to the Building Owner staff for up to two (2) hours in order to perform the training session explaining the thermographic IR2K images, while presenting a strategy, and answering any related Survey questions. 

w.	The survey will be conducted within 30 days of the receipt of the notice to proceed by contractor.  The survey will be completed within 60 days from the notice to proceed.

<DESC>*** 22 February 2011 ***
<p>There have been additional questions proposed by potential offerors and the responses are listed after the question.</p>
<p>1. My question about the accelerometer on the PD_REV3_11M-220A-VI_.docx document is what mentioned on paragraph 3.16Calibration Modes It states a `voltage mode accelerometers'. Would this be a regular charge(piezoelectric) type accelerometer that you need to measure the voltage sensitivity (high O/P impedance)? Or is this an accelerometer with certain type of built-in electronic circuit so it outputs low impedance voltage<br />signal? If it is the later type, would you be able to provide any information on the power requirement of such transducer?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: This is an accelerometer with a built-in electronic circuit so that the DUT outputs a low impedance voltage signal. The power requirement of the<br />transducer shall be supplied by the owner of the DUT and is not the responsibility of the provider of the VSCS.</p>
<p>2. Is a calibration capacitor supplied by the vendor required with the VSCS, or do Air Force PMEL facilities "normally" have this piece of equipment?<br />(ref Section 3.22)?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: The PMELs "normally" have this piece of equipment, therefore they shall not be supplied by the vendor.</p>
<p>3. Is a wide-screen laptop (16:9 aspect ratio) with a minimum resolution of 1366 x 768 or 1600 x 900 an acceptable alternative?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Yes, to both.</p>
<p>4. Section 6.2.11 states "Assumed input of &lt;10^5 pC for charge mode sensors". To our knowledge, no charge more sensor has such a high sensitivity and therefore we believe this is a typo. If so, what should the line read?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: I do know of some accelerometers with a 1000 pC/g sensitivity, which at 20 g is equal to 20000 pC which is equivalent to 2.0 x 10^4, therefore less than 10^5 pC is not a typo, but is the actual spec.</p>
<p><br />The due date for responses has also been extended from 24 February 2011 to 1 March 2011, 4 pm EST.</p>

						(End of clause)<BR><BR>AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM (NOV 2008):  If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>BLM Request for Proposals, L11PS00054, TECHNICAL REVIEW OF THE WILD HORSE AND BURRO PROGRAM. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Operations Center (NOC) intends to award a sole source contract to National Academy of Sciences, Office of Contracts & Grants, 500 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20001 for the continuation of a study of the science, methodology, and technical decision-making approaches of the Wild Horse and Burro Program.  In evaluating the program, the study will build on findings of three prior reports prepared by the National Research Council (NRC) in 1980, 1982, and 1991 and summarize additional, relevant research completed since the three earlier reports were prepared.  Section 1333 of the 1971 Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act (WFRHBA) provides the BLM with the authority to consult with individuals independent of Federal and State government who have been recommended by the National Academy of Sciences, and other individuals determined to have scientific expertise and special knowledge of WH&B protection, wildlife management and animal husbandry as related to rangeland management.  The success of any strategy the BLM develops hinges on our ability to bridge the many divergent and conflicting perspectives about how the Wild Horse and Burro Program should be managed in the West.  These differences have led to an increasing number of appeals, litigation, congressional inquiries, and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.  Many feel the BLM is not credible and does not apply the best science in managing Americas Wild Horse & Burro Program.  The recommendations that the NAS provides would benefit the BLM as we continue to work closely with Congress, the public and our stakeholders to identify strategies for the future management of the Wild Horse and Burro Program in the West that enjoy broad-based support.
A cost-type contract is anticipated, with a delivery date of the final published report of no later than twenty-four months after award of a contract.  The contractor must gather data and provide reports that will address the following key scientific challenges:  Estimates of the WH&B populations; Population Modeling; Genetic diversity in Wild Horse and Burro herds; Annual rates of WH&B population growth; Predator impact on Wild Horse and Burro population growth; Population control; Immunocontraception of wild horse mares (porcine zona pellucida);   Managing a portion of a population as non-reproducing; AML Establishment or Adjustment; Societal Considerations; and Additional Research Needs. 
All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by the BLM. Send information for technical evaluation to Steve Santoro at (303) 236-3518 by March 24, 2011.  See Note 22.

<DESC>Amendment 2 to DARPA-BAA-11-24 Deep Sea Operation (DSOP)
<p>The purpose of Amendment 2 to DARPA-BAA-11-24 Deep Sea Operations (DSOP) is to provide the following additional solicitation questions and answers.</p>
<p>10.	Section 1.1 Program Overview - For Phase 2 and 3 may demonstration of system performance thresholds be proposed using a suitably configured target simulator (e.g., EMATT) or should these demonstrations be planned using actual submarine target?</p>
<p>Proposals should indicate the best path forward.</p>
<p>11.	 Section 1.1.1 Program Phases<br />a.	 If the risk incurred in developing a sonar system (Phase 2) or an integrated system (Phase 3) is assessed to be excessive for the allotted time period (13 months each phase) may the contractor propose a longer period-of-performance that better balances risk and expected performance?</p>
<p>Follow the BAA guidelines.</p>
<p>b.	 Should the proposer conclude that a dedicated Phase 1b effort is not necessary, what date should the proposer offer for commencement of Phase 2?</p>
<p>This is left to the proposer, however note the minimal deliverables still required for Phase 1b.</p>
<p>c.	 The paragraph states, "Phase 3 must be completed before the end of January 2014 and should result in a fully integrated prototype system for demonstration." Should the contractor plan to have completed the demonstration prior to the January 2014 Phase 3 completion date?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>12.	Page 7, Section 1.1.2, "Plans for ocean testing, if proposed, that require government-furnished equipment, information and services should assume DARPA can support a single test opportunity in the Pacific sometime between July, 2011 and December, 2011."  Please clarify what assumptions, if any, should be made in terms of test duration, or the performer's ability to recommend specific time windows for testing within this six month windows.</p>
<p>Performers should recommend duration and timing based on their proposed effort.</p>
<p>13.	Page 7, Section 1.1.3. states that the Government expects to support 2-3 major sea tests for Phase 2, where at least the last test should culminate in the Western Pacific. Is this 2-3 major sea tests per performer?  Or 2-3 major sea tests across all performers?</p>
<p>The sea tests are across all performers. Testing assets will be shared when feasible.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />14.	Page 14, Section 4.3.1, asks for submission of "...an original, 3 hard copies and two (2) electronic copies of the proposal [in PDF (preferred)] on a CD-ROM."  Should both the cost volume and technical volume be on the same CDs, or should the cost volume be provided on 2 separate CDs?</p>
<p>A single CD may be used for both cost and technical proposals. The BAA requests that two electronic copies be delivered. Proposers may separate the cost and technical proposals such that four total CDs are used. This may be useful when the cost proposal is unclassified and the technical proposal is classified.</p>
<p>15.	Page 16, Section 4.4.1.1, instructions for Section II, Summary of Proposal, bullet G, refers to a four slide PowerPoint summary to be included in the proposal and points to Appendix 1 for the format. Appendix 1 only has 3 slides.  Please clarify whether there should only be 3 slides.</p>
<p>There should only be three slides.</p>
<p>16.	Page 15, Section 4.4.1.1., requires that a "Technical Area" be included on the Cover Sheet for both Volume 1, Technical and Management Proposal and Volume 2, Cost Proposal.  Please clarify what information is required to be listed.</p>
<p>The general technology area is "ASW" but if you choose, for example, to address only sonar or perhaps communications you may choose to put "ASW Sonar" or "ASW communications".</p>
<p>17.	Conflicting language in Section 1.1.3. of the BAA Amendment 1 makes the expectation unclear:<br />a.	In Section 1.1.3. Phase 2, the last sentence in the first paragraph reads, "Performers bidding for Phase 2 should also submit a bid for Phase 3." Then, in Section 1.1.3., the fifth paragraph reads, "The Government will determine whether to request Phase 3 proposals from Phase 2 performers. Phase 3 proposals will be evaluated ... the BAA. The Phase 3 cost proposal will only be solicited from Phase 2 performers."</p>
<p>By "bidding" Phase 3, performers are expected to have content in their technical proposal along with ROM cost estimates. If awarded to conduct effort in Phase 2, DARPA may request a detailed cost estimate for Phase 3 before awarding the option.</p>
<p>18.	Section 1.1.1 states that Phase 1b must be completed between Oct 1 and Dec 31.  Does this mean phase 1b is only three months long or can we assume an earlier start, such as July 1 as suggested in section 1.1.2, and do a six month effort provided it is completed by 31 Dec?</p>
<p>Anticipate a June 30 start date for the purposes of your planning.</p>

Section C-4, Aircraft Requirements, Paragraph A.1. states, "Single engine aircraft shall have a power loading of not more than 13.5 pounds per horse power." The paragraph does not define how the 13.5 pounds per horse power is calculated and led to confusion among interested offerors.<br />&nbsp;<br />Prospective offerors will be given an opportunity to offer on any resolicitation or any future requirements for the type of service involved. <br />

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Contracting Department Philadelphia Office intends to solicit on an unrestricted basis a requirement for Operation and Maintenance (O&M) services in support of the Forces Surveillance Support Center (FSSC) Relocatable Over the Horizon Radar (ROTHR) System.  The ROTHR System is a radar system that detects and tracks drug trafficking activities in Northern South American and Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico basins.  It is used by the Navy, North American Defense (NORAD), Customs, Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and other national security agencies.  ROTHR Systems are located in Virginia, Texas, and Puerto Rico.  The Contractor shall operate, maintain, and support the ROTHR Systems 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
  Additionally, the effort includes systems engineering, engineering change proposal preparation and analysis, failure analysis, configuration management, preparation, installation and testing of field change kits, logistics support, training, and repair and refurbishment services.  This requirement presents several challenges to the Contractor including having to work with a mature system, dealing with parts obsolescence, and the Government does not possess the Level III technical data associated with this unique legacy system.  See Numbered Note 26.  

A DRAFT of the possible Request for Proposals (RFP) is hereby attached for information/planning purposes only. Also included is a zip file of the DRAFT Attachments/Exhibits to the RFP.
 This is only a DRAFT solicitation and is subject to change.  Please submit any and all questions/comments regarding this DRAFT RFP through email to caitlin.sontowski@navy.mil.

<DESC>Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition 
 
Subject: Affected Property Assessment Report (APAR)  

The following justification and approval is made regarding the procurement of an Affected Property Assessment Report (APAR) for the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System (CTVHCS).  This is a sole source procurement and competitive procedures will not be used. The format for this justification is from the FAR part 6.303-2 and presented in the format prescribed.

1. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "justification for other than full and open competition."

Agency: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
Contracting Activity: Contracting Officer (90C)
 Central Texas Veterans Health Care System 
1901 Veterans Memorial Drive. 
Temple, Texas   76504

2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved.  

The contractor shall provide an Affected Property Assessment Report (APAR) as required by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) regulation 30 Texas Administrative Code (TAC), Chapter 350, Texas Risk Reduction Program and 30 TAC, Chapter 327, Spill Prevention and Control to CTVHCS. This is a follow on action to an environmental spill response in which the contractor accomplished phase one.  Therefore, the vendor selected for this emergency response activity is Zephyr Environmental Corporation, Austin, Texas.  Telephone: 512.329.5544.

3. A description of the supplies or services required in order to meet the agencies needs (including the estimated value). 
An environmental site assessment APAR is mandatory and required by TCEQ environmental regulation 30 TAC, Chapter 350 and 30 TAC, Chapter 327 (http://info.sos.state.tx.us/pls/pub/readtac$ext.ViewTAC?tac_view=5&ti=30&pt=1&ch=350&sch=C&rl=Y) 

This assessment will also support the VHA Environmental Compliance and Green Environmental Management System (GEMS) Program by ensuring fuel contamination is identified, delineated, and remediated.   The assessment supports VHA national policy directive 2005-011, VHA Green Environmental Management System (GEMS) and Governing Environmental Policy Statement and CTVHCS Memorandums 004SIH-001-09, Green Environmental Management System (GEMS) and 004SIH-036-11, Notification of Environmental Incidents.

The required delivery date for this assessment is 26 January 2011.  On 27 January 2011, the VA was required to submit to TCEQ a written certification that the second phase of the emergency response activities (the environmental site assessment APAR) has been initiated.  This is required as part of the spill response action plan provided to the State.  The following factors contributed to Zephyr Environmental Corporation continued use in the agency's response: availability, ability, expertise, credential and past performance .  Zephyr has previous experience in conducting these types of environmental assessments and has conducted previous projects at the Temple VA Medical Center.  These projects have included assessment of VA fuel tank systems and the development of spill clean-up and emergency response action plans.  Any delay in the award of the contract could result in the VA being liable for environmental penalties or fines from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and further contamination of the soil and groundwater.  

4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 
The statutory authority allowing use of other than full and open competition for this requirement is, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2), unusual and compelling urgency..

5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. 

The Contractor, Zephyr Environmental Corporation is a woman-owned consulting firm and has previous experience conducting these types of environmental site assessments specifically meeting all the requirements of Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 30, Chapter 350.  Zephyr has also conducted previous work at the Temple VA Medical Center which has included the development of Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plans.  They are very familiar with all of CTVHC's diesel fuel systems and emergency response activities.  This experience will be invaluable in conducting the environmental site assessment and ensuring that fuel contamination is properly assessed.  Additionally, the contractor has demonstrated reputable past performance.  As a result, it was decided to be in the best interest of the government to acquire this contractor's continued services. 
6. Actions to Promote Competition: A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a CBD notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. 

There will be no solicitations for other offorers. 

7. A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. 

This requirement is a sole source to Zephyr Environmental Corporation, a Woman Owned Business. The anticipated price to the Government is $109,100.  The cost was evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.402 to subjectively determine reasonableness also whether the costs reflect the value of the offeror's effort and whether the costs were consistent with the requirements. In accordance with FAR 15.403-(3)(ii)(B) research was conducted to ascertain historical prices paid under comparable terms and conditions by the Government. Other factors that considered were lead time, service availability, and the affect of an uncontrolled hazardous material release on the public, CTVHCS and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The offorers proposed price will be determined fair and reasonable  IAW FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii) comparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government and commercial contract prices with current proposed prices for the same or similar items.

8. A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. 

 Market research was conducted utilizing the internet. The research was conducted through GSA to search for vendors providing similar services, which could possibly satisfy the customers' requirement.   The Small Business Administration' s Dynamic Small Business Search Engine was queried to identify any service disabled veteran owned and /or veteran owned small business entities utilizing NAICS code 541620. The result of this query showed that the company is a Woman Owned, SDB certified, and HUBZone Certified. Therefore this procurement is being set aside for Zephyr Environmental Corporation. 

9. Any other facts support the use of other than full and open competition. 

This is an urgent and compelling need to complete this assessment with a specified period of time to meet regulatory rules and standards. Due to the nature of the APARS report there is a short time frame to collect  the necessary data and provide  aa APARS report to the State of Texas.  


10. A listing of the sources, if any that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.

None

11. A statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.
