<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:<br />1. CRITERIA: White papers and/or proposals will be evaluated through a peer or scientific review process using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: <br />(1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit --The approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology including technical feasibility, degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational approach for evaluation of the technology.<br />(2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge,<br />(3) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). <br />No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:<br />1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.<br />All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.<br />2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET/SCI information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use. Please note that use of the JIFFY or TFIMS application requires customers outside of the .mil domain to purchase an approved External Certificate Authority certificate to facilitate a secured log on process. It is necessary to obtain an ECA certificate BEFORE obtaining a JIFFY or TFIMS user account. Additional information on obtaining an ECA is available at: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html.</p>

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command, and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to invite bids to provide an enhanced camp surveillance system for International Security Assistance Force Headquarters (HQ ISAF) in Afghanistan.
<p>The competition will be conducted in accordance with the Alliance Operations and Missions (AOM) International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure. The contract shall be awarded on a lowest price technically compliant basis.</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce will consider eligible for nomination to the bidders list only those U.S. firms that have been pre-approved for participation in ICB - see Bidding Procedure, below.</p>
<p>The technical specifications applicable to the bidding and the contractual documents are NATO UNCLASSIFIED. For performance of the contract, however, contractor personnel will be required to hold a NATO SECRET security clearance and be required to deploy to Afghanistan. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to NC3A the required NATO security clearance certifications.</p>
<p>The estimated cost for the services and deliverables is not available at this time. The reference for the Invitation for Bid (IFB) is IFB-CO-13355-OPL. The Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.</p>
<p>NC3A plans to place a single contract for the entire scope of work. No partial bidding will be allowed.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The project provides for the installation of a stand-alone closed circuit television (CCTV) ground surveillance system composed of masts, 16 cameras of various types, monitoring screens, a monitoring control center, and a digital video recorder with a 30-day storage capacity. The monitoring stations shall be integrated within existing buildings alongside existing capability on the HQ ISAF compound. Additionally, the project installs the cabling from the camera to the monitoring stations and all interconnections in between.</p>
<p>The capability will permit security staff to monitor activities during day, night, or inclement weather to provide for active situational awareness and expedited response to protect NATO assets and personnel.</p>
<p>The system will need to be fully configured, tested, documented, and fielded in ISAF. Furthermore, appropriate operational and general maintenance training to security personnel for the CCTV system is required.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB. The U.S. Department of Commerce approves facilities that are located within the United States.<br />U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:<br />http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA. The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO-member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request a DOE (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit completed one-time NATO ICB application) no later than 12 January 2012</p>
<p>- IFB planned to be issued by the end of January 2012</p>

<p>- Contract Award expected to take place in May 2012</p>

<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Surgery Branch plans to procure on a sole source basis services from DecisionQ Corporation, 1010 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 310, Washington, DC 20007 for the development of prognostic and predictive models for gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer using machine-learned Bayesian Belief Networks. <br /><br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13.106 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $7.0 million.<br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this procurement.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>The Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute is involved in the conduct of laboratory and clinical research aimed at improving the care, management, and outcome of patients with cancer. As such, Surgery Branch investigators are developing prognostic and predictive models for gastric and pancreatic cancer outcomes using machine-learned Bayesian Belief Networks. <br /><br />A set of SEER Public Use data will be used to produce Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) classifiers that can estimate the probability of mortality of a given subject at 12, 24, 36, and 60 months for each of Gastric Cancer and Pancreatic Cancer. These models will be cross-validated for statistical significance and interpreted for clinical significance. The models will be enabled in a web- or mobile interface so that they can be used by clinicians to derive individual prognostic estimates.</p>
<p>Following the identification and curation of the SEER data and the preparation of training and test sets, the data will be modeled using machine-learning to produce Bayesian Belief Networks. The machine-learning algorithm must use Bayesian Information Criterion scoring or equivalent (Minimum Description Length or Model Length scoring). The machine learning algorithm should be capable of handling 100+ features simultaneously, handling features with up to 100 unique text levels, and capable of incorporating text, numeric, and date values in the same training exercise and model. The Bayesian Belief Networks produced by the algorithm must be stored in a readily accessible format (XML, HTML, PMML, or equivalent) and be capable of display through a web interface that a user can use to interact with the algorithms.</p>
<p>DecisionQ Corporation is the only known contractor that can perform the required services for this contract. DecisionQ sells the proprietary software, FasterAnalytics, and services that are the only known products capable of training machine-learned Bayesian models from these types of data sets. DecisionQ Corporation is the only certified provider with this software to the healthcare sector.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Aging (NIA), <br />intends to negotiate, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, on a noncompetitive, <br />sole source basis, with the Icelandic Heart Association for the project entitled, <br />"Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility - Reykjavik Study (AGES - Reykjavik) Continuation. "
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources may express their interest by submitting a capability statement or proposal. All capability statement/proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This effort will be for a one (1) year base period and three (3) one year option periods.</p>
<p>The "Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility - Reykjavik Study (AGES -<br />Reykjavik) Continuation" is in accordance with the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).</p>
<p>The Contractor must use the data management system that was developed for AGES-Reykjavik Study. The Contractor must access participants enrolled in the AGES-Reykjavik Study and have access to previously used equipment to maintain continuity in any measures that might be done as part of ancillary studies. The Contractor shall maintain study-wide policies and procedures relevant to data usage and scientific productivity of the study. It is essential the Contractor provides optimal performance of services so there will be no discontinuity in work performance and that smooth continuation of the AGES-Reykjavik Study be maintained.</p>
<p>The proposed Contractor is thus uniquely qualified, alone possessing all the elements critical for performing the tasks detailed in the Statement of Work, including access to participants enrolled in the previous study and availability of the required resources for study. Further, all critical study components have been developed, implemented, field-tested, and refined by the proposed Contractor in collaboration with the NIA over the course of the previous study. No other Contractor could provide a comparable service in a timely and cost-efficient manner. In addition, successful follow-up with participants requires continued and regular contact that has been established and maintained by the proposed Contractor. It is essential for optimal performance of this contract that there be no disruption in work performance and that smooth continuation of the project be maintained as can be provided by the incumbent, IHA. If another Contractor were to be awarded the proposed contract, it would seriously compromise the infrastructure, integrity and scientific productivity of the project; such as loss of scientific leadership and staff with intimate operational knowledge of the study and duplication of costs associated with purchasing a new data management system, ability to contact study participants and access the medical and death records of participants. The IHA has the unique capability to provide the required services to NIA for the AGES-Reykjavik Continuation.</p>
<p>In summary, the requirement must: (1) be performed in Iceland and use the original Icelandic Study Participants for the purpose of maintaining participant cooperation and study follow-up success; and, (2) utilize the IHA developed the data management system. The transfer of the data management system to another Contractor (other than incumbent) would be disruptive to the project requiring start up time to become familiar with over ten years of invaluable and irreplaceable data, cause unacceptable delays to the project and require duplication of cost to purchase and develop a system. Inherent risk of loss of decades of data collection, unacceptable delays, and duplication of costs to the Government in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this study.</p>
<p>Background and Aims: The Laboratory of Epidemiology, Demography and Biometry (LEDB), an intramural research laboratory of the National Institute on Aging (NIA), will support through a research contract, a clinical research project, the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility -Reykjavik Study (AGES-Reykjavik) Continuation. The purpose of this study is continued analysis and scientific exploration of the AGES-Reykjavik cohort by means of data analysis, hospital, nursing home, and death records abstraction, and ancillary projects. The primary aims of the requirement are:</p>
<p>AIM 1: Perform core study functions, consisting of study management and communication, ongoing outcomes ascertainment from medical and death records, maintenance of and access to biological specimen and image repositories, and data management, to allow for continued analysis of the AGES-Reykjavik Study data.</p>
<p>AIM 2: Perform genomic analysis on traits collected in previous contracts for the AGES-Reykjavik Study.</p>
<p>AIM 3: Initiate and conduct ancillary studies in the AGES-Reykjavik Study cohort or in its offspring.</p>
<p>The Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study was initiated in 2001 by the Laboratory of Epidemiology, Demography, and Biometry of the NIA's Intramural Research Program to examine genetic susceptibility and gene/environment interaction as these contribute to traits and phenotypes common in old age. As the effects of aging are multi-system, AGES-Reykjavik included four related biologic systems: neurocognitive (cognition, dementia, depression, neurosensory (vision, hearing, balance); cardiovascular (atherosclerosis, arterial distensibility, ventricular and valvular disease); musculoskeletal (spine and hip osteoporosis, hip osteoarthritis, strength and function); and body composition and metabolism (obesity, sarcopenia, and hyperglycemia/diabetes). These biologic systems were chosen based on the hypothesis that genes in pathways, such as inflammation or glucose metabolism, could contribute to phenotypes both within and across these systems.</p>
<p>The AGES-Reykjavik Study participants were recruited from survivors of the Reykjavik Study, a longitudinal cohort study of men and women born in 1907 through 1934 in Iceland who were examined at least once and up to six times for cardiovascular risk by the Icelandic Heart Association (IHA). This nested design allows for better assessment of traits because earlier life traits generally are associated with greater heritability and are less likely to be affected by concurrent illnesses in old age. A cost-sharing research contract between the NIA and the IHA started in 2001 to carry-out the first "old-age" clinic and home exams of the Reykjavik Study survivors. This baseline exam was conducted in 5,764 participants. Through the same contract, a second, follow-up clinic examination began in 2007 and 3,200 of the AGES-Reykjavik participants were examined. Through the course of the AGES-Reykjavik Study, information on outcomes and disease status has been supplemented by matching hospital, nursing home, and mortality records to the cohort. Numerous ancillary studies, through grants and additional NIH or IHA funding, have been conducted to take advantage of the opportunity of the extensive clinical information available on this cohort.</p>
<p>The study will be performed as a follow-up contract to the Age Gene/Environment Susceptibility - Reykjavik Study. The major focus of this new contract will be to continue to accumulate and share endpoints extracted from external databases; to maintain the biobank and image repositories; to continue analysis of genetic and epidemiologic data collected in the study; to continue the scientific work of this study by conducting studies of genetic transmission of selected phenotypes in offspring of AGES-Reykjavik Study participants; and to participate in state-of-the-art work on biomarkers.</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide the scientific infrastructure to maintain repositories of data, biospecimens, and images acquired throughout the AGES-Reykjavik Study and in any ancillary studies, to maintain health and vital status records, to provide data, biospecimens, or other materials that may be requested for collaborator research approved by the AGES-Reykjavik Study Executive Committee. The Contractor will also provide resources to carry out two ancillary studies that are anticipated under this Contract: one dealing with family structure and genetic transmission focused on the brain and the other a study of proteomics or metabolomics. The Contractor is expected to provide input into the content and feasibility of all aspects of the activities carried out as a part of this contract.</p>
<p>The following six goals shall satisfy NIA's requirement for this project:</p>
<p>A. Participate in the scientific direction of AGES-Reykjavik and provide study communication infrastructure for tracking of analysis projects, oversight of ancillary studies, and publications based on AGES-Reykjavik. <br />B. Provide data updates for hospitalization, nursing home admissions and assessments, vital status, and cause of death for all participants of the AGES-Reykjavik Study. <br />C. Conduct statistical analysis, data management, maintenance, and distribution of data files.<br />D. Provide scientific direction and analytic support for genetics research associated with AGES-Reykjavik.<br />E. Manage the maintenance and tracking of biologic specimens and MRI and CT images obtained in earlier AGES-Reykjavik contracts. <br />F.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.

<DESC><p>AHRQ Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) 2013-2018<br />Sources Sought</p>
<p>Description: <br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>NAICS: 541690<br />Classification Code: B</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research was established in 1989. Its reauthorizing legislation (42 U.S.C. 299 et seq; "Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999") renamed it the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and established it as the lead Federal agency whose mission was to enhance the quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health services and access to such services for all Americans. AHRQ's mission is to produce "measurable improvements in health care in America, gauged in terms of improved quality of life and patient outcomes, lives saved, and value gained for what we spend." Under the Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999 (S 580), which reauthorized AHRQ, AHRQ's reauthorizing legislation stated that, "The Agency shall promote health care quality improvement by conducting and supporting- (1) research that develops and presents scientific evidence regarding all aspects of health care, including- (2) methods for measuring quality and strategies for improving quality; and (3) initiatives to advance private and public efforts to improve health care quality." (http://www.ahrq.gov/hrqa99a.htm )</p>
<p>The Agency conducts and supports a broad base of scientific research and promotes improvements in clinical and health system practices, including the prevention of diseases and other health conditions. AHRQ sponsors and conducts research that develops and presents evidence-based information on healthcare outcomes, quality, comparative effectiveness, patient safety, cost, use and access. Included in AHRQ's mandate is support of the generation, synthesis, and dissemination of scientific evidence, including effectiveness research and analytic methods.</p>
<p>The mission of AHRQ is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans. To help fulfill this goal, AHRQ sponsors the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), a family of health care databases and related software tools, products, and statistical reports to inform policy makers, health system leaders, researchers, and the public.</p>
<p>Through voluntary partnerships with a number of State, Federal, and Industry organizations, HCUP has grown from a single database limited to inpatient hospital care to a family of six state- and national-level databases, covering inpatient, ambulatory surgery, emergency department, and pediatric encounters. As a result, HCUP has become the largest all-payer resource of multi-year hospital discharge data from community, non-Federal, short-term (acute care), general, and specialty hospitals in the U.S.</p>
<p>The participation of state-wide public and private data Partners is essential for the success of the HCUP project and is based on cooperative, detailed agreements made between AHRQ and each data Partner. Currently, there are 45 States with data organizations that participate as HCUP Partners by sharing their inpatient data. Of those 45 States, 30 also share their ambulatory surgery data and 29 also share their emergency department data with AHRQ.</p>
<p>HCUP databases continue to grow in response to this vital partnership: Every year since 1988, HCUP has released new, expanded information on inpatient, emergency department, and ambulatory surgery services. HCUP's inpatient databases now include over 95 percent of all community hospital discharges in the U.S. HCUP is positioned to assist in understanding many of the hospital-related health care challenges that Americans will face in the future. As the U.S. embarks on a major health reform initiative to cover the uninsured, expand coverage for other populations, and continue its effort to improve the quality and value of care, AHRQ's successful collaboration with its HCUP Partners will continue to provide essential hospital information to measure progress towards these goals.</p>
<p>Detailed descriptions of the project and data can be found at the HCUP Web site at: www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov .</p>
<p>Databases<br />The HCUP databases are quite large in size and contain a core set of clinical and nonclinical information found in a typical discharge abstract including all-listed diagnoses and procedures, discharge status, patient demographics, and charges for all patients, regardless of payer (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, uninsured). The information is translated into a uniform format to facilitate both multi-State and national-State comparisons and analyses.</p>
<p>Links to all HCUP databases and detailed descriptions are available at: https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/databases.jsp . HCUP databases include:</p>
<p>The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) with inpatient data from approximately 8 million hospital stays from a national sample of over 1,000 hospitals.</p>
<p>The Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) is a nationwide sample of pediatric inpatient discharges and contain a sample of over 3 million discharges from more than 4,100 U.S. community hospitals.</p>
<p>The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) is a database that yields national estimates of emergency department (ED) visits and contain more than 29 million unweighted records for ED visits at about 1,000 U.S. community hospitals.<br /><br />The State Inpatient Databases (SID) contain the universe of inpatient discharge abstracts from participating states. Currently, the total of all the state inpatient records in a given year is approximately 36 million.</p>
<p>The State Ambulatory Surgery Databases (SASD) contain data from ambulatory care encounters from hospital-affiliated and sometimes freestanding ambulatory surgery sites. The total of all HCUP ambulatory surgery records in a given year is approximately 35 million.</p>
<p>The State Emergency Department Databases (SEDD) contain data from hospital-affiliated emergency departments for visits that do not result in hospitalizations. The total of all HCUP emergency department records in a given year is approximately 85 million.</p>
<p>Prospective purchasers and all persons with access to the databases are required to read and sign a Data Use Agreement and must agree to use the database for research and statistical purposes only and to make no attempts to identify individuals.</p>
<p>Software Tools<br />AHRQ has developed free software tools that can be used not only with the HCUP databases listed above, but also with other administrative databases. These tools can be downloaded without charge and include such clinical classification software, comorbidity software, cost-to-charge ratios, and chronic condition indicator. All the HCUP tools are described at: http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/tools_software.jsp .</p>
<p>In addition to data and tools, HCUP also encompasses such activities as creating timely information from the data, providing user support, electronic documentation, centralized data distribution, technical data training, publications, and research, among others. It is anticipated that the next five years will also be a period of immense change as well and will require innovative and forward thinking approaches to conducting this highly complex and multifaceted project.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>As currently designed, the HCUP contract annually produces over 100 inpatient, ambulatory surgery, and emergency department state-level databases, three nationwide databases, over 60 publicly disseminated databases, ten software tools, seven supplemental files and numerous presentations and trainings; receives over one million visits per year on the HCUP Web site; and responds to approximately 3,000 technical assistance and data support inquiries per year.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that during the base year of the contract, considerable effort and expertise will be needed for the contractor to establish and build the infrastructure to simultaneously contact and build a relationship with HCUP Partners, obtain, process, document, and deliver multiple databases of varying structures, and complete the process of collecting and preparing the 2011 databases (data for discharges occurring in calendar year 2011), and beginning the 2012 data cycle. It is also expected that the Contractor shall prepare and disseminate HCUP Central Distributor files; conduct special analyses, provide technical support and training, and prepare the HCUP-based materials and statistics for the National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Reports. Most tasks will be repeated annually, with specific activities conducted periodically throughout the 4 optional years.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform the following types of services under this contract:</p>
<p>&bull; Process and create uniformly formatted State inpatient and outpatient encounter-level data files obtained from HCUP Partners created from billing records and derivative nationwide databases;<br />&bull; Conduct research and policy analyses using the breadth and depth of HCUP data to explore the impact of changes in health policy on health care, to document and analyze explanations for trends in health care, and to propose and test alternate hypotheses about the relative importance and impact of a variety of structural and clinical factors on health care outcomes; <br />&bull; Prepare technical reports and publications; <br />&bull; Recruit data partners, complete data applications, negotiate or update Memorandums of Agreement for participation, and purchase data from HCUP Partners;<br />&bull; Operate the HCUP Central Distributor, which handles all activities directly related to the sales and dissemination of the restricted access public release HCUP databases (the NIS, KID, NEDS, and a sub-set of the full State files used by AHRQ) and related HCUP files;<br />&bull; Provide AHRQ staff and HCUP Partners with technical support;<br />&bull; Deliver user technical support on HCUP databases, software tools, linkable files, written reports and all other products developed for the HCUP project;<br />&bull; Develop and update ICD-9 based software tools that enhance the value of HCUP data and other administrative data;<br />&bull; Supply medical coding expertise to maintain health care software tools such as ICD-10 and CPT/HCPCS coding;<br />&bull; Provide statistical and sampling methodology <br />&bull; Create documentation and maintain and enhance the HCUP documentation system;<br />&bull; Maintain and further develop the HCUP Web site (HCUP-US) which serves as the project's primary vehicle for public outreach, and a virtual repository for project information and documentation;<br />&bull; Support the generation of estimates derived from HCUP data for the Congressionally- mandated reports: National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Reports primarily through applying the AHRQ Quality Indicators (QI) software to the HCUP national and State databases;<br />&bull; Adhere to HHS Security and Privacy Policy commensurate with the risk associated with HCUP; <br />&bull; Developing systems for monitoring and maintaining secure and efficient computing environment (including programmer resources); and<br />&bull; Reporting, work planning, management meetings.</p>
<p>Firms should note that HCUP research data and databases are not stored on-line nor are they available for download on the HCUP-US Web site. HCUP generally does not receive electronic transfer of data nor does it provide any external access to the computing system used for collection or processing of HCUP data.</p>

<ARCHDATE>01112012
<CONTACT>Kevin Lydon, 609-485-7381

<a href="mailto:kevin.ctr.lydon@faa.gov">kevin.ctr.lydon@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>Announcement is being posted to amend previous announcement #11309 posted November 29, 2011 [Title: Quantitative Surface Measurement of Fluorescent Magnetic Particle Indications Equipment].  Amendment includes a statement of work to clarify the requirements.  Please use in conjunction with previous announcement.
The procured system is to be a custom digital video UV fluorescence inspection system with calibrated solid state illumination that will be used by Iowa State University (ISU) to measure magnetic particle (MP) indications as part of a separate FAA-funded research grant to study and improve the MP test method.  The system will consist of the following:
        Modified Sentech STC-GEC202A color 1600 x 1200 camera that supports the  GigE Vision  standard.
        Filter modification for optimized viewing of UV fluorescence includes 16 mm f 1.4 high resolution lens focus range from 1" to infinity.	        UV LED ring light assembly with installed thermocouple (TC) and control unit/power supply with TC display.  Calibrated for output of 2000 W at 100 mm distance measured at 365 nm with white light content <1 fc. Temperature display, power supply and intensity control unit in desktop format.	        Extension tube kit for magnifying. Kit will include tubes of 5mm, 10mm, 20mm, and 40mm thickness.		10' cable assembly to support the operation of camera, LED module and desktop control unit with TC display)
The system will need to be delivered to and tested by ISU for approval prior to payment.  If system does not meet performance requirements then it will be returned to vendor without payment or further DOT/FAA obligation to vendor.  ISU testing shall be done within 21 days after delivery of the system.  Performance testing includes testing UV light output and white light output to determine if maximum white light is less than 1footcandle and minimum UV light output is greater than or equal to 2000microwatts per centimeter-squared and properly centered around 365nm in wavelength. UV light output must be uniform over entire field of view of camera at the prescribed standoff distance. Details of the UV and white light measurement should follow industry standard ISO 3059.  This details allowable spectral response of lighting system. UV output uniformity and all other operating requirements should follow ISO 9934-3 section except where not applicable (intensity measurements at 100mm, not 400mm for instance).
Delivery of the system should be made within 6 weeks of the award.
Original Announcement (posted November 29, 2011):
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center has a requirement for:  Equipment needed to make quantitative surface measurements of fluorescent magnetic particle (MP) indications to support a study the FAA is conducting to understand and improve the magnetic particle inspection method.  The light emitting diode (LED) ring assembly is required for several reasons: the LED will provide instant intensity needed for the imaging to occur eliminating the 30 minute warm up time required by other ultraviolet (UV) sources;  the low amount of heat generated by the LEDs will not affect the camera lens or the assembly; the compact size of the light will accommodate the physical assembly, and finally the LEDs can be positioned in such a fashion as to eliminate "Hot Spots" often associated with conventional UV lights.  The lens filter and camera need to observe the surfaces under test and enhance the resultant images while viewed under UV illumination.

This is an announcement for a Request for Quote (RFQ) for several components needed to make quantitative UV measurements of Magnetic Particle test results at the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, Atlantic City, New Jersey.
SCOPE OF WORK
The following equipment and shipping shall be provided for the quantitative UV measurements of Magnetic Particle test results:
Items: 
1.) QTY 1	STC-GEC202A w/ Filter Mod for Viewing UV STC-GEC202A Color GigE Camera 1600 x 1200 with Filter Modification For Viewing UV Fluorescence 
2.) QTY 1	HF16SA-1 Lens 
3.) QTY 1	EXT TUBE KIT 51020 & 40MM THICKNESS TUBE Extension Tube Kit 
4.) QTY 1	UV LED Ring Light Assembly UV LED Ring Light Assembly with Installed Thermocouple and Control Unit / Power Supply with TC Display 
5.) QTY 1	10Ft Cable Assembly (Camera, LED, TC)
6.) QTY 1	Freight if any. (Firm fixed-price)
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with a response to the RFQ are solely at the interested vendor's expense.
This procurement will have a dollar threshold between $10,000 and $100,000. Proposals will be reviewed through tiered evaluation selection process.

<DESC>This Sources Sought (SS) Notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).
<p>The purpose of this SS is to identify qualified small business concerns, including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) that are interested in and capable of providing the BioComp Instruments Gradient Station with Fractionator Tube Holders, Seton Centrifuge Tubes, and Fractionator accessories.</p>
<p>The NHLBI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought notice, the NHLBI may issue a Request for Quote (RFQ).</p>
<p>There is no solicitation available at this time.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or the NHLBI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns, particularly Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>

All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought announcement must have the capabilities to provide the below product within 30 days after receipt of purchase order.</p>
<p>Background Information</p>
<p>The Laboratory of Ribonucleoprotein Biochemistry in NHLBI conducts research on the function of messenger RNA-protein complexes in health and disease.  The gradient station is necessary for the formation and fractionation of density gradients.  Density gradient centrifugation is an important technique for the biochemical analysis of mRNAs.  These experiments require reproducible formation of gradients of sucrose, glycerol, or other solutions, followed by ultracentrifugation and collection and analysis of fractions.  In particular, the experiments require gradient fractionation followed by mass spectrometry to identify proteins present in individual fractions.  Because mass spectrometry is a highly sensitive technique, it is essential that samples generated both within a single experiment and across several experiments be as similar as possible.  The gradient station is a unique instrument that combines and automates making reproducible gradients and collecting very small, high resolution fractions which are essential for NHLBI studies.</p>
<p>Specifications</p>
<p>-	Combined instrument for making reproducible gradients and fractionating them after ultracentrifugation;<br />-	Automated, programmable gradient making capability;<br />-	Compatibility with a large number of solutes;<br />-	Simultaneous formation of six (6) gradients for optimal reproducibility;<br />-	Automated high resolution gradient collection (fractionating) capability;<br />-	Built-in monitoring of fraction volume and position;<br />-	In-line UV monitoring and fraction collection with digital data collection; and,<br />-	Small footprint to maximize limited bench space.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 10 single-sided pages (including all attachments) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to provide this equipment.  Statements should also include an indication of current certified small business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement (preferably placed under the eligible small business concern's name and address).  Responses will be reviewed only by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.</p>
<p>All capability statements sent in response to this SOURCES SOUGHT notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Jonathan Lear, Contract Specialist, at learj@nhlbi.nih.gov in either MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), by December 27, 2011, 9:00am, EST. All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered.</p>

<DESC>Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), a federally funded research and development center operated by The Trustees of Princeton University under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, seeks expressions of interest from firms with the capability and capacity to design, assemble, and deliver Power Supply Units (PSUs) to power trim coils on a Stellarator type fusion device located in Germany. PPPL anticipates the procurement of five (4 - Type A, 1 - Type B) Power Supply Units within fiscal year 2012 (ending September 30, 2012). Each power supply unit consists of an AC-DC converter front end, a capacitor bank DC-link, and a switching power supply back end. While the experiment is pulsed in nature, the pulse length is such that the power supply rating should be considered as steady state. The basic specification requirements for the Power Supply Units are described in the attached table and will be further documented in a specification attached to a Request for Proposals (RFP) anticipated to be released during fiscal year 2012.
<p>The Power Supply Units described above require four-quadrant operation; however, PPPL would like to receive industry comments on the feasibility of a lower cost option using standard two-quadrant rectifiers of the same basic rating. This is not a request for proposals (RFP) but a Sources Sought request. Neither Princeton University nor the U.S. Government will reimburse offerors for any costs incurred in responding to this announcement. Expressions of interest, including comments on the feasibility of the two-quadrant rectifier option, may be sent via email to the RFP Coordinator, Mr. Kevin Ranahan at kranahan@pppl.gov. Please include company name, individual point of contact name, mailing address, telephone number, fax number and email address. When a formal solicitation is issued for this requirement, offerors responding to this announcement will be notified.</p>

<p>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission to this announcement or the Government use of such information. The information provided may be used by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in developing its acquisition strategy, statement of work/statement of objectives, and performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>USSOCOM is requesting industry comment on its ability to provide non-developmental, multi-functional devices with the maximum number of attributes as identified in Attachment 1 to this RFI. Those not able to provide all preferred features are still encouraged to submit information on the features currently available in their products and propose an applicable schedule, for those features that are not. This initiative is referred to as the USSOCOM KIBOSH 40mm Low-Velocity Non-Lethal Delivery System (LVNLDS).</p>
<p>USSOCOM is in the process of formally categorizing attributes into various levels and priority of requirements including Key Performance Parameters (KPP). Special Operations Forces (SOF) missions require teams and individuals to be capable of stopping a vehicle/vessel and clearing a space. Each KIBOSH LVNLDS shall be capable of being shot from a 40mm Low Velocity Grenade Launcher from over a distance of 150 feet and effectively dispensing the contents of a liquid or gas payload the size, shape and weight of a 12 gram Crossman CO2 cartridge into a vehicle, vessel, or room without going all the way into the space and harming individuals inside. SOF equipment must be multifunctional and work against multiple targets. This requires a technology readiness level (TRL) of no less than TRL 6.</p>
<p>The intent of the RFI is to identify those companies that possess the technical expertise, current production facilities, and integration and test capability to assemble, test, and produce systems in quantities of 30 or more per month. The KIBOSH LVNLDS shall be assembled from Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and/or Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) hard/software and ready for shipment six months After Receipt of Order (ARO).</p>
<p>Once the information is received, USSOCOM may publish a synopsis requesting further information and industry comments on a refined set of requirements along with a draft acquisition strategy and milestone schedule.</p>
<p>Interested parties shall respond, within 30 days&nbsp;from the posting date of this RFI, with existing or near-term mature capabilities or products that meet all or a subset of the aforementioned attributes. All responses shall be submitted to the Contracting Specialist, Mr.&nbsp;Carlos Cotto, carlos.cotto@socom.mil and Contracting Officer, Ms. Candida Keller, candida.keller@socom.mil with a copy to the Program and technical point of contact, Mr. Ryan Brown, ryan.brown@socom.mil.</p>
<p>This announcement is a request for information/comment only and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP). An RFP may be posted on Fed Biz Ops at some future time. However, the Government does not guarantee any action beyond this RFI.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT. This posting serves as notice of intent that the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Eastern Acquisition Division, intends to issue a fixed price type contract for services to distribute sea turtle tags and management of the Cooperative Marine Turtle Tagging Program (CMTTP). Until April 1999 there were two sea turtle tag distribution and archival centers for the Western North Atlantic: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) and the University of Florida Archie Carr Center for Sea Turtle Research. The Archie Carr Center distributed tags to many collaborators in all areas of the world since 1955, having distributed over 200,000 tags. They have established an internationally known database system and communication network. Individuals of that network communicate throughout the world with local fishermen and other citizens and help to arrange for the return of tags from captured turtles. NMFS had maintained its CMTTP since 1980 and had distributed about 100,000 tags. The Government intends to award a fixed price type contract on a sole source basis to the following entity: University of Florida, Division of Sponsored Research, 219 Grinter Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611. A Sources Sought Notice entitled - Sea Turtle Tag Distribution, was posted in the FEDBIZOPPS on 11/14/2011 for seven days from which no responses were received. As a result of having received no responses, the government intends to issue a sole source contract to the University of Florida under the authority of Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Title VIII, PL 103-355) as implemented at Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.102 and Subpart 13.106-1(b) for simplified acquisition and the authority of the test program for commercial items section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. Justification for Sole Source: The statement of work for the required sea turtle tag distribution services can be found in the Sources Sought Notice and are not reiterated here. The University of Florida Archie Carr Center is the only other known source to provide the required services. This Notice of Intent does not invite a response. However, if a response is received it will be provided to the end user for future consideration.

Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis.<br />(B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer.<br />(C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative.<br />(D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualification s for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract.<br />(E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis.<br />(1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated.<br />(2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(3) If the Schedule provided rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer.<br />(ii) Materials.<br />(A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall be the contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the--<br />(1) Quantities being acquired; and<br />(2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.<br />(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor-<br />(1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or<br />(2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.<br />(C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall-<br />(1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and<br />(2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract.<br />(D) Other Costs.

It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.<br />(3) Ceiling price.

When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.<br />(4) Access to records.

The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.<br />(7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions.<br />(i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor.<br />(ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.<br />(iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.<br />(8) Prompt payment.

For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made.<br />(l) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.<br />(End of Clause)<br />FAR 52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services (NOV 1999)<br />The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract.

However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES: Please review the solicitation document for clause changes.

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM  STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 

(1)   The offerors past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.
  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System  Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  

(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).

(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a suppliers past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).
  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the suppliers overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:

	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*
	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*
	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*

* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.

(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the suppliers percentage of on time deliveries.
  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.

(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.

(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is issuing Request for Proposal (RFP) DU205NC-12-R-0002 in support of the Office of Policy Development and Research.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demonstration will test alternatives to the current rent structure in the Housing Choice Voucher Program using a random assignment experimental model.&nbsp; Rent reform may impact assisted housing residents in terms of the rents they pay, the amounts they save and earn, as well as the income stream to the Housing Agency that administers the housing subsidy.&nbsp; The demonstration would mostly likely be undertaken at select Moving to Work (MTW) sites, because MTW Public Housing Agencies already have a legislative authority to request waivers from the 1937 Housing Act.&nbsp; While a goal of the current study is to increase earnings, that goal may be achieved through more complete reporting of income and higher wages.&nbsp; Because the intervention is not directly focused on employment, the impact of work effort may be relatively small.&nbsp; Additionally, a reasonable goal of rent reform is to reduce under-reporting of income which would have the effect of increasing reported earnings.&nbsp; The work requirements are set out in the Statement of Work within the RFP.&nbsp;&nbsp;Services to be furnished under the resulting contract shall be ordered by issuance of a task order.&nbsp; Such order(s) may be issued from effective date of contract through sixty (60) months thereafter.&nbsp; North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541720.&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposals will be due on January 20, 2012.&nbsp; Please submit questions to Pat Leseman at <a href="mailto:pat.leseman@hud.gov">pat.leseman@hud.gov</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

Two courses are needed, a Paramedic Certification Course and a Critical Care Course; both courses are to be accredited by CoAEMSP and be taught in accordance with the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians and the Board of Critical Care Transport Paramedics for the FP-C standard.  More details concerning the courses are in the Performance Work Statement which is incorporated in this document. <br><br>This Solicitation is comprised of the following:<br>I.  Contract Line Item (CLIN) Specifications<br>II.  Performance Work Statement<br>III. Applicable FAR and DFARS clauses<br>IV.  Attachments<br><br><br><br><br><br>I.  CONTRACT LINE ITEM (CLIN) SPECIFICATIONS<br>CLIN 0001- Paramedic Certification Course<br>CLIN 0002-Critical Care Clinical Course<br>Courses shall be accomplished in accordance with the below attached Performance Work Statement	<br><br><br>II.  PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT<br>Performance Work Statement for Non-Personal Services<br>US Army Critical Care Flight Paramedic Program<br><br>1. General.  This is a non-personal services contract to provide paramedic training and certification as well as critical care clinical training in order to prepare students for the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians-Paramedic (NREMT-P) and Certified Flight Paramedic (FP-C) examinations.  The US Government will not exercise any supervision or control over the contract service providers performing the services herein.  Such contract service providers shall be accountable solely to the contractor who is, in turn responsible to the US Government.<br><br>1.1.  Background.  The US Army Medical Department (AMEDD) has identified a gap in the training and knowledge base in the flight medic community. The current conflicts around the globe have seen a significant increase in the survivability of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines in combat. This has, however resulted in an increase in critically ill and complex patients further forward on the battlefield. In the past, it has been the duty of the flight medic or corpsman to render en route care in the back of medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) or casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) aircraft from either the point of injury (POI) or sites of damage control surgery.  The current training standard for Army Flight Medics is Emergency Medical Technician or NREMT-B. In the civilian air ambulance setting, NREMT-B medics are not authorized to provide the level of en route care required by modern combat casualties. Furthermore, the AMEDD has studied the problem and identified an improvement in outcomes when MEDEVAC units have a higher proportion of NREMT-P trained personnel than those with predominantly NREMT-B.  The Commanding General, US Army Medical Department Center & School (AMEDD C&S) determined that in order to bridge the training gap between battlefield providers and their civilian counterparts the US Army will establish a training program to upgrade training to the NREMT-P standard for 100% of all existing flight medics, and train all new flight medics to the NREMT-P standard.  Additionally, all new flight medics will receive critical care training in an ICU setting.  The US Army Critical Care Flight Paramedic Program consists of four phases: Phase 1 is the distance learning (computer-based training) course administered by the Army; Phase 2 is the Flight Medic Course taught by the US Army School of Aviation Medicine; Phase 3 is the paramedic certification portion covered by this contract; and Phase 4 is the critical care clinical course also provided by this contract.  Upon completion of Phase 3, students will take the NREMT-P examination, and upon completion of Phase 4, students will take the FP-C exam.  The contractor provides administration of both exams under the terms of this Performance Work Statement (PWS).  After completing the exams, students will participate in a one-week field environment validation exercise provided by the Army.<br><br>1.2.  Scope of Work.  The contractor shall provide a paramedic certification course consisting of no more than six months, a critical care clinical course consisting of no less than 8 weeks, exam administration of the NREMT-P and FP-C exams, and remediation for student failure as described in this PWS.<br><br>1.2.1.  The contractor shall provide qualified personnel, services, materials, equipment, supplies and facilities necessary to conduct a fully accredited paramedic training program for no greater than 60 students (two iterations of up to 30 students per iteration) selected by the US Army for enrollment.<br><br>1.2.2.  The paramedic course shall be accredited by the Committee on Accreditation of Educational Programs for the Emergency Medical Services Professions (CoAEMSP).  <br><br>1.2.3.  The contractor shall provide qualified personnel, facilities, services, materials, equipment and testing capability to conduct the didactic portion of the critical care course and administer the FP-C examination.  The critical care clinical course will involve training in medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU), surgical ICU, pediatric and neonatal ICU, cardiac ICU, burn unit, and anesthesia/post-operative care in an inpatient setting.  <br><br>1.2.4.  The course curriculum shall be in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT) and the Board for Critical Care Transport Paramedic Certification (BCCTPC) for the FP-C standard. <br><br>1.2.5.  The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.<br><br>1.2.6.  Safety Requirements: The contractor shall maintain health and safety standards compliant with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA.)<br><br>1.2.7.

Operational Security: Neither the contractor nor any of its contract service providers shall disclose or cause to disseminate information concerning operations of military activities.  Such action(s) could result in violation of the contract and possible legal actions.<br><br>1.2.9.  All inquiries, comments of complaints arising from any matter observed, experience, or learned of as a result or in connection with the performance of this contract, the resolution of which may require the dissemination of official information, shall be directed to the contracting officer's representative (COR) and the contracting officer.<br><br>1.2.10.  The contractor shall only conduct business with designated government personnel listed as points of contact (POC's.)  Names of authorized personnel will be provided to the contractor by the government, in writing, no later than three days after award, and updated as necessary throughout the contract period.<br><br>1.2.11.

<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Award Basis: The Government's evaluation of quotation will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under the Addendum to FAR 52.212-1. The evaluation of these factors will utilize the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) award basis. Quotes that do not meet the quote specifics will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without exchanges or communications and therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms.</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation: Evaluation factors required under 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows;</p>
<p>i. Price: To evaluate price reasonableness, a comparison will be made amongst all received quotations and the Government's estimate.</p>
<p>ii. Technical Qualification: A vendor's quotation will be considered technically acceptable if it meets the requirements detailed in paragraph C of the Addendum to FAR 52.121-1 above. Quotations that do not meet these requirements will be considered unacceptable and therefore, under the LPTA evaluation process will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>(c) AWARD DETERMINATION: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors, whose quotes are determined to be technically qualified, and therefore technically acceptable, will be considered for award. No trade-offs will be permitted between price, and the non-price factor of technical capability. Of those vendors found technically acceptable, an award determination will be made to the lowest priced vendor that is determined to be reasonable, realistic, and affordable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services.<br />The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days.<br />52.217-9 -- Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.<br />a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.<br />(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.<br />(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 50 months.<br />52.232-18 -- Availability of Funds.<br />Funds are not presently available for this contract.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. <br />If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one of the following:<br />Primary point of contact:<br />Contract Specialist: Justin Haynes<br />TEL: 01638-52-2344 or EM: justin.haynes@lakenheath.af.mil</p>
<p>Secondary Point of contact: <br />Contracting Specialist: Benjamin Shelton<br />TEL: 01638-52-2185 or EM: benjamin.shelton@lakenheath.af.mil</p>

Thus making this requirement Service Brand Specific.</p>
<p>(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.<br />Market research was conducted and this support can be only purchase through Oracle and contractors that are authorized re-sellers of Oracle Service.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. <br />This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U S Coast Guard, 2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112, Washington, D.

This solicitation will be a technical/past performance - price tradeoff evaluation based on the three evaluation factors of technical, past performance and price.  The Source Selection Authority (SSA), using sound business judgment, bases the source selection decision on an integrated assessment of the three evaluation factors.  The SSA may select a higher-rated, higher-priced offeror, when the SSA reasonably determines the better technical approach and past performance of the higher-priced offeror justifies the higher cost.  

(b) Procedures

(1) All offerors will be required to prepare and submit their complete proposal submission in accordance with the proposal preparation instructions in Provision 52.212-1 of this request for proposal.  Proposals and other information will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria stated in this provision.  

(2) Discussions: The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  If the Contracting Officer determines that discussions are required, a competitive range, limited to the highest rated proposals for efficiency purposes, will be determined IAW FAR 15.306(c) and discussions will be held with the offerors in the competitive range.  Upon completion of discussions, all offerors still in the competitive range will be provided an opportunity to submit a final proposal revision.  A common cut-off date for submission of final proposal revisions will be established.  

(c) Evaluation Factors

(1) Factors:  The Government will select a best value offeror that conforms to the solicitation, which is most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Technical, Past Performance and Price. Factors are listed in order of importance. Technical and Past Performance when combined are considered significantly more important than Price for tradeoff purposes.  


(e) EVALUATION APPROACH

i) Assessment: The offeror's proposal shall, as a minimum, address each of the technical proposal criteria as they apply to the SOW.  During evaluations of each proposal, the Government will assess each area of the Technical Proposal to ensure the offeror meets or exceeds the standards of the contract.  The Government will evaluate the technical proposal based on the evaluation criteria described in Section A through F below, which are tailored to specific principal tasks in the SOW.  The Government will infer from the offeror's responses to these specified evaluation criteria the offeror's capability to perform to the requirements of the entire SOW.  In order to be considered for award, the offeror must demonstrate the ability to provide adequate and qualified staff and expertise to satisfy the statement of work requirements by describing or providing the information requested below:

A) The contractor shall provide evidence of being recognized as a Macolm Baldrige award winner

B) The contractor shall have industry recognition of excellence customer service Industry recognition will be demonstrated by the organization having received at least two of the following customer service recognitions: J.D. Power, Customer Satisfaction; AAA Five Diamond Properties; Luxury Institute's Platinum Seal of Customer Approval, Mobil Five Star Status).

C) The contractor shall have industry recognition of excellence in workforce training and   development. Industry recognition for training will be demonstrated by recognition in the top 5% of  the "Training Top 125" survey by Training Magazine within the 10 years.  

D) The contractor shall have a specific, developed process for providing advisory services to a  health care organization to include an initial 2  day, on-site discovery session

E) The contractor shall have a developed curriculum for training on creating a culture of excellence (focus areas to include employee and customer engagement and loyalty customer services program)

F) The contractor shall demonstrate their ability to provide services Statement of Work (SOW) paragraph 2.3

Past Performance - Factor 2

(i) Factor Assessment: The purpose of Past Performance evaluation is to assess the degree of confidence the Government will have in an Offeror's ability to provide services that meet customer needs.  The Past Performance evaluation will assess how relevant the Offeror's contracts on previous efforts of similar size and scope to this acquisition have been rated by their customers.  The evaluation will focus on and target performance that is relevant to the principal tasks of the SOW, (i.e. providing Baldrige Training stated in the SOW).   More recent and relevant performance will have a greater impact on the performance confidence assessment than less recent and/or less relevant effort.  A performance confidence rating will be assigned based on the offeror's ability to perform the requirements of this solicitation

 (ii)  Description of factor:

(A) The Government will conduct a past performance review of each competitive offeror.  Evaluations will be based on present and past performance information provided by the Offeror and gathered from various sources.  In addition to the information provided by the Offeror's customers, the Government reserves the right to use data obtained from other Government and commercial sources.

(B) Recent:  A contract is considered recent when performance of the effort is ongoing or has been completed within the past 3 years.  Current performance will have a greater impact in the confidence assessment than less recent performance.  

(C) Relevancy:  The government will perform an independent determination of data relevancy, provided or obtained.  The main assessment of relevancy focuses on capability and magnitude.  Capability assesses whether the work being performed in the reference is similar to the work in our requirement.  Magnitude defines whether the amount of work in the reference is similar to the amount of work in our requirement.  An effort is considered relevant when there is a logical connection with document destruction services.  The scope of past performance information in value and size shall also be considered in determining relevancy.   More relevant performance will have a greater impact on the confidence assessment than less relevant effort.

(D) Performance:  The government will perform an independent determination for each contract reference, provided or obtained.  

(iii) A lack of relevant past performance information shall be rated as an unknown performance risk, having no positive or negative significance.  A strong record of relevant or semi-relevant past performance may be considered more advantageous to the Government than a "Neutral/Unknown confidence" rating.  Likewise, a more relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and be considered more favorably than a less relevant record of favorable performance.   

  (4) Price - Factor 3

(i) Factor Assessment:  This criteria evaluates the overall price to determine if the proposed price is fair and reasonable.  The Government may determine an offer unacceptable if the proposed prices are materially unbalanced which is defined as significantly understated or overstated in relation to the actual cost of that work or when the price is determined not to be fair and reasonable.    The individual unit prices listed in Price Schedule will be evaluated using the price analysis techniques prescribed by FAR 15.404-1(b).

(ii) Ratings:  Price proposals will be evaluated, but not rated.

(iii) Description of factor:  The Government will conduct a price review of each contract line item.  Evaluations will be based on a comparison of the aggregate price of all offerors.  The aggregate price is the sum of contract line items 0001

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Transparent Occlusive Dressings. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The government is seeking a single vendor selection for this SA.<br /><br /></span></em></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Portsmouth Naval Hospital, Womack Army Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center., Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, and 48th Medical Group, RAF Lakenheath; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is May 2012. </strong>The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection.<br /></span>Points of Contact: <br />Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil, 808-433-3686 and <br />Wendy Sprouse, MMESO Pacific Clinical Analyst, wendy.a.sprouse@amedd.army.mil, 808-433-7985<br /></strong><br />B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Transparent Occlusive Dressings. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $927,007.63. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, fifty-one (51) of the total fifty-one (51) line items represent the top two (2) product groups and account for 100% ($927,007.63) of the total volume in sales $927,007.63 in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific, Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil and Wendy Sprouse, Clinical Analyst, wendy.a.sprouse.ctr@us.army.mil. </strong>The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Pacific that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO Pacific via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</strong></span></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs.</strong> The MMESO Pacific reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br />Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements <br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the company/technical requirements outlined below. The five (5) requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.<br /></span></strong>1.

Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO Pacific, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the specific CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation in Phase II. <strong>Product samples must be shipped no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after issue of notice, and arrive at the designated addresses for each MTF by 5:00PM local time before the 30th calendar day. Vendor must be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples as requested to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) Express Mail AND throughout the United States by selected shipping method when requested in Phase II. Vendor must send the MMESO Pacific verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. One (1) box of Transparent Occlusive Dressings, from each of the two size ranges indicated below, is to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites identified in the letters of invitation.<br /><strong>SAMPLE SET<br />1)Dressings transparent occlusive (IV) small size ranging from approximately 1 1/2"x 1 1/2" and approximately 2 3/4"x 4"<br />2)Dressings transparent occlusive (IV) large size ranging from approximately 3"x 3" and approximately 3 3/4"x 5"</strong></p>
<p>Each evaluator will evaluate sample products from each vendor&nbsp;against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, against the requirements and recording on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) Completely Unacceptable, two (2) Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) Partially Unacceptable, four (4) Acceptable, and five (5) Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Pacific and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately seven (7) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements <br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. Efficiency of Use/Patient Safety/FDA Standard for Device Labeling - 21 CFR 820.120 - The packaging is easily identifiable as to size and type of product. Product packaging will be clearly and boldly labeled with the product type and size in order to avoid errors and waste.<br />2. Standard: IC.02.02.01: The hospital reduces the risk of infections associated with medical equipment, devices, and supplies. Product packaging is easy to open and allows for aseptic delivery to a sterile field. Product packaging must be easy to open and allow for aseptic delivery to a sterile field as compromising the sterile field could lead to patient infection.<br />3. Patient Comfort/Clinical effectiveness/Cost - The care of wounds; a guide for nurses, 3rd ed. - Design of dressing allows for easy application and product readily molds to a variety of anatomical shapes. This type of dressing is used on many different areas of the body, including those that curve, roll, fold, and have hair (i.e., subclavian &amp; forearm). Patient comfort and clinical effectiveness are of primary importance with any dressing product. Having to replace them frequently because they do not stay in place is very costly.<br />4. Patient Safety/Prevention of Infection - NPSG 07.04.01: Implement evidence-based practices to prevent central line -associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) - Dressing adheres securely to patient's skin, while removal of product does not damage skin. Impaired skin integrity increases patient's risk of infection.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Pacific and must be received by 5:00PM HST thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></span></p>

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 60 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<p>Information Regarding Responsibility Matters (Jan 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this provision-</p>
<p>"Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings). This includes administrative proceeding at the Federal and State level but only in connection with performance of a Federal contract or grant.

<p>(1) The total value of all current, active contracts and grants, including all priced options; and</p>

<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters.<br />As prescribed in 9.104-7(a), insert the following provision:</p>
<p>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)</p>
<p>(a)</p>
<p>(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --</p>
<p>(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples.</p>
<p>(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

<p>(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) Examples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

<DESC>*Notice: Actual period of performance is 300 days*<br /><br />The Air Force is seeking sources for a potential 100 percent set-aside for 8(a) Region V, HUBZone, Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB), or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns. IF ADEQUATE RESPONSES ARE NOT RECEIVED, THE ACQUISTION MAY BE SOLICITED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS. This is a sources sought for planning purposes only. This effort is Project 090001, Replace Steam Lines between manhole S-229 and facility 20029. The project scope includes the removal of underground steam and condensate return lines, and the installation of new steam lines in shallow trench from manhole S-229 to facilities 20028, 20248, 20198, 20197, 20196, and 20029. The contractor will need to hook up two Government furnished temporary boilers to provide summer steam to Facilities 20030 and 20033 during project construction. Existing steam &amp; condensate return lines are assumed to contain asbestos containing insulating materials.
<p>Special Requirements/Concerns: Steam distribution systems require specialized construction skills and safety preparations. Standard facility construction experience is not sufficient. The contractor shall have very tight construction timelines since these repairs cannot be started until after the high temperature/hot water (HTHW) system is turned off, and this must be completed in time for activation in the fall for this critical utility system. Numerous facilities will not have heat until this project is completed. The work will need to be carefully coordinated with the mechanical shop to minimize impact to mission. This project also includes HVAC and asbestos work.<br />The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 300 day period of performance.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of the entire contract is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 238220 Size Standard: $14M.</p>
<p>Prime contractors who are 8(a) Region V, HUBZone, WOSB or SDVOSB and who intend to submit a bid for this solicitation are highly encouraged to submit the following by 9:00 a.m. (local Dayton time) on 05 JAN 12:</p>
<p>Responses should include the following:<br /><br />(1) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this solicitation as a Prime Contractor; <br />(2) date of HUBZone certification; and/or<br />(3) documentation of SDVOSB status; and/or<br />(4) 8(a) certification; and/or<br />(5) WOSB status; and<br />(6) listing of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact with their phone numbers, and an explanation of the relevancy of the project; <br />(7) documentation from surety or their agent of your capability to be bonded for bid, performance and payment bonds for this project;<br />(8) If you are a HUBZone considering a joint venture that has not been formalized, you will need to specify the firm(s) you intend to partner with and how you plan to officially form the joint venture.</p>
<p>Firms interested should provide the above documentation. Fax or e-mail responses will be accepted. All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on the availability of interested 8(a) Region V, HUBZone, WOSB, or SDVOSB concerns. Responses shall be limited to 5 pages. Please include your DUNS Number or CAGE Code on your response. Failure to submit all information requested would result in a contractor being considered "non-responsive" in this requirement. A decision on whether this will be pursued as a set-aside or an unrestricted basis will be posted as a modification in Federal Business Opportunities.</p>

<DESC>Questions/Answers <br>The below questions were submitted for the reference solicitation..<br><br>Q: Which transceiver is this cable going to plug into, is there a specific brand name and model?<br>A: CMDC MT2012 SATELLITE TRANSCEIVER<br><br>Q: Would you please include technical specifications for the cable identified (P/N 998-506B921-01) this looks to be a proprietary part number<br>would you identify the manufacturer?<br>A: Tech Drawing included - Aerospace Part # 506B921-01 - Do not believe this is a proprietary part number. <br><br>Q: What is the exact distance between P2 and P3?<br>A: 1-3/16 inch <br><br>Q: The casing is identified as stranded silver, is the a color request or a material request. Please elaborate?<br>A: This stranded silver does not refer to the case - only the grounding wire,which is grounded to the case, it should be stranded conductors. <br><br>Q: What is the distance from P2 to the bottom of plug?<br>A:   inch<br><br>Q: What is the distance from P3 to the top of the plug?<br>A: 5/8 inch <br><br>Q: Regarding P3 & P2 they are both installed on the same end of the cable, but I think they are molded into that end.  The only separate connector<br>appears to be the mate to P3, shown at the far right of the drawing.  Let meknow what you find about the molded end (if that is what they are calling<br>out).  It appears custom molds would require and specific dimensional drawings would be required.  If an equivalent to the spec is possible would<br>that be an option?<br>A: A separate connector mates to P2 and a separate connector mates to P3. Plug size could not exceed current outside dimensions.  Equivalents would need to pass government review prior to contract award.  <br><br>Q: We have not been able to locate information on part # 001-388-55, which is the backshell on the spec sheet given on page 2. Is there any way you can find out any more information on this?  <br>A: Actual back shell is labeled with this part #: ITT 0808 J MS3111E8-4P<br><br><br>Q: Bulk Cable 998-5068921-01  ( Do you know who makes this cable? )<br>A: Per drawing provided, MFG is Aerospace Systems<br><br>Q: The Mold that houses P2 and P3.  Is this an over mold or a case? The 614-773,614-773-01 and PEC 614-773-002 Do you know who molds this part? It is an over mold.   <br>A: Possibly molded by Aerospace Systems.  <br><br>Q: Back shell P3 001-388-55  ( Who's part number is this?)<br>A: Unknown assumption is Aerospace<br><br>Q: Does the customer posses the injection molding tool for the connector? <br>A:  Government does not possess the injection molding tool.  If a non-molded connector is identified as a possible replacement, government needs to<br>approve it prior to contract award.  <br><br>Specification data for the spools have been uploaded. <br>

<DESC>** Amendment 001 adds all Attachment J.3 Post Exhibits for sites included in this solicitation.  These documents identify the required staffing levels for each facility.  Please note the acknowledgement requirements found in item 11 of this amendment. **
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Facility Security Risk Management Program (FSRM) office has a requirement for security officer services throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. Territories.  These services are being procured in order to provide physical security safeguards for FAA employees, facilities, and United States Government property and assets from loss, theft, damage, unauthorized use, criminal acts, espionage, sabotage and terrorism.
Scope of Effort:  This Screening Information Request/Request  for Offer (SIR) is for Security Officer (SO) Services within the Central Service Area.  A complete listing of included facilities can be found in Section B of the SIR.  The Contractor must furnish all labor, supervision, materials, equipment, transportation, training, and management necessary to provide SO services in accordance with the stated requirements. The Contractor must implement all necessary scheduling and personnel and equipment control procedures to ensure timely accomplishment of all SO service requirements
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code  to this effort is 561612 Security Guard and Patrol Services with the size standard of $18.5 Million.
In order to provide opportunities for the small businesses and to ensure the FAA requirements are met, the acquisition strategy for this procurement includes the use of a tiered evaluation of offerors with the following tiers:
I.	8(a) CompaniesII.	SDVOSBIII.	Small BusinessesIV.	Large Businesses
(1) Tiered evaluation of offers is a process by which FAA promotes small business participation while providing the FAA a means to continue the procurement if small business participation is insufficient.
(2) The FAA may use tiered evaluation of offers to promote competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other than small business to participate without issuing another SIR.
(3) The FAA will consider the tiers of small business concerns prior to evaluating offers from other than small business concerns.
All business classifications will be encouraged to submit offers for this SIR.  The FAA will proceed with the evaluation of offerors and award within the lowest tier found to contain adequate competition among technically acceptable offers.  An offer is considered technically acceptable if:
1) The offer is not grossly or obviously deficient; and2) The offer receives at least a marginal evaluation rating in the management, technical and past performance factors.  
Adequate competition exists when at least two offers are compared. If only one proposal is received in a lower tier, this offer from a lower tier may compete with higher tiered submissions in order to achieve adequate competition
Each offeror may be considered as a prime contractor for only one Service Area (SA) award but has the ability to pursue subcontracting opportunities on any service area awards without restriction.  The FAA will only recognize one Prime Contractor per offer.  In accordance with AMS clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations on Subcontracting  at least 50% of the work must be performed by employees of the Prime contractor Award for awards made under the first three tiers.  
The resulting award will be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP IDIQ) with one Time and Material (T&M) Contract Line Item (CLIN) and a period of performance of one base year and four one year options to begin on October 1, 2012.
In order to maximize competition and to address concerns raised by the vendor community, significant changes have been made to the SIR since it was released in draft form on June 15, 2011. The largest concentration of changes can be found in Section C, Statement of Work (SOW), and in Section M, Evaluation of Offers.  
As part of the FAA Small Business Conference, a briefing was presented on July 18, 2011 that provided attendees an overview of the program contract strategy for the National Security Officer Program.  This briefing is also attached to this announcement.
Questions or comments pertaining to this SIR must be submitted in written form via email to Robert C. Taylor II, Contract Specialist, at robert.c.taylor-ii@faa.gov.no later than 2:00 p.m., January 5, 2012.  Questions and responses that clarify the SIR may be provided to all Offerors; however the source of the questions will not be identified.  
The FAA plans to publish responses to questions on January 18, 2012, and host a teleconference with interested parties on January 19, 2012, at 2:00 p.m. EST.  Due to the limited availability of dial in access lines, interested parties are requested to limit representation to one dial in access per company. 
Teleconference details are as follows:Dial In: 202-493-4180  Passcode: 8176
Please be advised, Attachment J.2, Facility Post Orders, and J.3, Facility Post Exhibits, are being distributed in a generic format.

(3) The FAA will consider the tiers of small business concerns prior to evaluating offers from other than small business concerns.
All business classifications will be encouraged to submit offers for this SIR.  The FAA will proceed with the evaluation of offerors and award within the lowest tier found to contain adequate competition among technically acceptable offers.  An offer is considered technically acceptable if:
1) The offer is not grossly or obviously deficient; and2) The offer receives at least a marginal evaluation rating in the management, technical and past performance factors.  
Adequate competition exists when at least two offers are compared. If only one proposal is received in a lower tier, this offer from a lower tier may compete with higher tiered submissions in order to achieve adequate competition
Each offeror may be considered as a prime contractor for only one Service Area (SA) award but has the ability to pursue subcontracting opportunities on any service area awards without restriction.  The FAA will only recognize one Prime Contractor per offer.  In accordance with AMS clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations on Subcontracting  at least 50% of the work must be performed by employees of the Prime contractor Award for awards made under the first three tiers.  
The resulting award will be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP IDIQ) with one Time and Material (T&M) Contract Line Item (CLIN) and a period of performance of one base year and four one year options to begin on October 1, 2012.
In order to maximize competition and to address concerns raised by the vendor community, significant changes have been made to the SIR since it was released in draft form on June 15, 2011. The largest concentration of changes can be found in Section C, Statement of Work (SOW), and in Section M, Evaluation of Offers.  
As part of the FAA Small Business Conference, a briefing was presented on July 18, 2011 that provided attendees an overview of the program contract strategy for the National Security Officer Program.  This briefing is also attached to this announcement.
Questions or comments pertaining to this SIR must be submitted in written form via email to Charles Lingafelt, Contract Specialist, at charles.lingafelt@faa.gov no later than 2:00 p.m., January 5, 2012.  Questions and responses that clarify the SIR may be provided to all Offerors; however the source of the questions will not be identified.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division intends to negotiate and award a cost plus fixed fee IDIQ task order under Basic Ordering Agreement N68936-09-G-0001 Task Order 0002, under other than full and open competition.  Negotiations will be conducted with AAI Corporation, P.O. Box 126, Hunt Valley, MD 21030-0126, in order to procure engineering technical services,  consisting of engineering analysis, software development, software integration/testing, development/delivery of laboratory equipment , and technical documentation support of the Organizational level (O-Level) Electronic Warfare Test Program Set (OEWTPS) planning, development, and sustaining efforts.  This Task Order provides for engineering services, delivery of Test Program Interface Hardware (TPIH), and technical documentation that supports the U.S.
 Navys Organizational level (O-Level) Electronic Warfare Test Program Sets (OEWTPS).  This task will require design and qualification of TPIHs that will be used in conjunction with the common support equipment (CSE) AN/USM-670 Joint Service Electronic Combat System Tester (JSECST) and its attendant OEWTPS software and hardware.  The OEWTPS also includes other existing interface hardware known as Antenna Coupler Interconnecting Groups (ACIG).  This combination of equipment and software is used by the U.S. Navy (USN), U.S. Marine Corp., and Foreign Military Sales [FMS] customers to provide an O-Level maintenance capability to test, troubleshoot and repair their onboard electronic warfare [EW] systems.

The primary role of EW systems is to enhance the survivability and mission effectiveness of tactical aircraft through situational awareness provided by radar warning receivers (RWR) systems and self protection provided by defensive electronic countermeasures (DECM) systems.
  Each year brings new challenges to these EW systems in the form of new and/or modified threat weapon systems.  The EW Support Equipment (EWSE) team located at the Naval Air Warfare Center  Weapons Division (NAWCWD) Pt. Mugu, CA is tasked with developing the maintenance solutions that ensure the EW systems remain mission ready.   This mission-oriented OEWTPS software and associated hardware require updates as a result of the highly dynamic tactical and strategic environments which drive changes to the EW systems.  This procurement of TPIHs is being driven by an update to the F/A-18C/D RWR, as dictated by ECP-MDC-F/A-18-00622.  This ECP, herein referred to as ECP-622, authorizes the retrofit of the ALR-67(V)3 RWR in F/A-18C/D aircraft.

This notice is not a request for proposals; however, any firm, other than AAI Corporation should respond in accordance with Numbered Notes 22 and 26.
