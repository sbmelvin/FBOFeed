Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This opportunity is only available to the contractor(s) who were awarded the contract(s) for work in response to Solicitation No. AG-04R3-S-09-8113, “COLLABORATIVE RESTORATION STEWARDSHIP, ON THE UMATILLA, WALLOWA-WHITMAN, MALHEUR AND OCHOCO NATIONAL FOREST”. The original solicitation was competitively advertised as a Commercial Items RFP. The Government intends to award multiple Delivery Orders from a single request for quotations.  This project will be partially or wholly funded with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds and is subject to all reporting requirements thereto. 



The Collaborative Restoration Stewardship contract is an integrated resource contract that includes ground-based logging, cable logging, and product transportation and slash treatment.  The issuance of these Delivery Orders require the contractor(s) to reduce the potential of high intensity wildfire by removing or rearranging the existing fuel loading on the forest floor.  This will be accomplished on selected locations on the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. All biomass removed will remain the property of the US Government and be transported by service contractor to local processors. This work will result in retaining healthy, vigorous understory trees at an average spacing of 20 feet to improve tree conditions and forest health, reduce ladder fuels located beneath overstory trees to reduce individual tree torching potential, provide a fuel loading profile that promotes defensible space for fire suppression, and for the re-introduction of fire in the project area. Fuel loading objectives relate to the remaining tons/acre and size of material left after treatment. Target fuel loading objective is to have no more than 10-12 tons per acre left once the work is completed. Slash treatment where required will be accomplished using mechanized equipment to masticate (chip) the slash. 



This project requires removal of approximately 8,000 tons of non-saw material (merchantable woody biomass).



The resultant contract(s) will be a firm-fixed price, with requirements for biomass removal. 



If you have questions about this project please contact Gary Dillavou Contract Specialist at (541) 278-3841.

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal(RFP) for the fabrication of detector module subassemblies (DMS) each consisting of aninfrared sensor chip assembly (SCA), thermal isolation cable and sensor cold electronics(SCE) to meet the requirements of the Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM).  The JDEM is ajointly funded and developed mission by NASA and the Department of Energy (DOE) and is aspace-based, medium aperture, wide field, optical telescope with near-infrared (NIR)imaging and spectroscopic instrumentation.  JDEM will survey the sky to accuratelymeasure the magnitude and redshift of a large sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia),spectroscopic redshifts of a large sample of galaxies for Baryon Acoustic Oscillation(BAO) studies, and accurate shape parameters and photometric redshift measurements of alarge sample of galaxies for Weak Lensing (WL) studies.	NASA contemplates building an Engineering Development Unit (EDU) focal plane and needsDMSs to populate it.  The objectives of the EDU focal plane are to assess our ability toassemble and align multiple, close-packed SCAs into a mosaic array, remove and replaceSCAs without disturbing neighboring SCAs, assess performance of the SCAs over theoperating temperature range, and assess the ability of the EDU to withstand the dynamiclaunch environment. NASA seeks a complement of DMSs in accordance with our preliminaryspecification.	The specification requirements were developed as part of our assessmentof scientific and mission requirements for JDEM.

Description
The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Experimental Carcinogenesis intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Illumina, Inc., 9885 Town Center Drive, San Diego, CA 92121-1975 for a service agreement/maintenance service for Government owned instrument iScan Genetic Analyzer System, s/n N160.

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).

Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.

Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve (12) months.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Experimental Carcinogenesis (LEC) supports an integrated research program designed to elucidate the cellular, genetic, and molecular changes associated with both experimentally induced carcinogenesis and human cancer; define the molecular mechanisms involved; and, delineate pathways that may provide novel targets for cancer treatment and prevention. Studies are performed in experimental animals (i.e., transgenic and knockout mouse models), in cell culture, and in tissue and cells obtained from patients.  The iScan Genetic Analysis System supports the rapid, sensitive and accurate imaging of all Illumina BeadChip-based genetic analysis products.
 
The contractor shall provide two (2) preventative maintenance inspections. Technically qualified factory-trained personnel shall perform service. Emergency repair services shall be provided on an unlimited basis during term of this contract. Unlimited web-exchange, all required replacement parts and labor. 48 hour average on-site response time, demos, non-critical and critical updates, and one (1) three day in-house applications training shall also be provided.  Personnel shall have a minimum of three (3) years factory training and experience in the servicing of iScan Genetic Analyzer system as covered by this contract

The Illumina iScan Genetic Analyzer system service maintenance agreement can be solely provided by Illumina. Only Illumina certified service engineers who are employees of the company and are trained in all aspects of service to the iScan Genetic Analyzer system are authorized to service the equipment. The service agreement of the iScan and all its parts is only guaranteed if is serviced by illumina engineers. The proprietary software controlling the iScan is constantly being upgraded and this can only be done by qualified Illumnia service engineers. This equipment is required for continuation of ongoing studies. The equipment must be compatible with the existing system at the LEC. Having the equipment in the lab will allow for more control of the processing before and after processing at the LEC, and allow for more processing to be done by the lab and will generally assist the investigators in accomplishing their goals. Use of any other service agreements on this instrument would void support of the equipment by Illumina. For these reasons, there is no other source known to the NCI capable of performing the maintenance needed on the instruments referenced in this procurement.

No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax), an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI contracting office to the address stated above.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Karri Mares, Contract Specialist at maresk@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Mod. V976 is a 1-unit VME module housing four 4-input Coincidence Fan in/Fan out and NIM – TTL / TTL – NIM adapter sections. Each section features 4 inputs and 4 outputs on LEMO 00 connectors and can operate as a 4 channel level translator or as AND/OR gate. It is possible to use two or four sections together to obtain an 8 or 16 input majority The logic functions can be selected via front-panel and internal switches. Some extra functions, such as a 1 to 12 Fan Out, can be performed by cascading properly the module’s sections. The output width is not regulated by a monostable, but it is equal to the duration of the input condition which makes the logic function true. The module accepts NIM and TTL inputs; the output can be programmed to provide either NIM or TTL levels as well, either direct or negated.

<p>This is a Presolicitation Notice in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations System (FAR) 5.204 and is not a Request for Proposal/Request for Quotation (RFP/RFQ). The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is finalizing its requirements for managed wireless products and services as described in the draft Statement of Work (SOW) that accompanies this announcement, and intends to solicit proposals from small businesses. To ensure that our requirements are accurately and clearly stated, reflect processes and procedures that are consistent with commercial best practices, and create an adequately competitive marketplace, we seek industry comments and questions on our draft Statement of Work. Please provide your review comments and questions to TSA by December 4, 2009 at Wireless-RFI@tsa.dhs.gov.</p>
<p>TSA's Office of Information Technology (OIT) oversees the procurement, delivery, operation and maintenance of all information technology for the agency. Included among the broad responsibilities is a program that provides wireless communications services to staff in locations in the United States (including its territories, possessions, and protectorates) and throughout the world. OIT seeks a Small Business Contractor to implement and manage a comprehensive wireless program that includes the acquisition of equipment and equipment related services; the procurement, repackaging, and reselling of wireless services; and the attendant program management services. TSA's present contractor manages a program that currently fields 14,911 devices. The new contractor will be required to successfully transition the existing devices and their attendant services to their contract without a loss in service. The contractor shall implement and use best business practices and continuous improvement to provide TSA an effective and efficient program that includes, but is not limited to, cellular wireless account consolidation and rate plan optimization, requisitioning and provisioning support, invoice reconciliation and expense management, service and equipment asset accountability, and management reporting (see the Draft SOW) in a performance-based contract.</p>
<p>The information being sought is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation for TSA to issue a solicitation. The Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in the preparation or submittal of responses to this notice. All costs associated with responding to this notice will be borne solely by the responding party. At the present time, there is no solicitation for these requirements. Should the Government issue a solicitation for these requirements, it will be posted, and made available to the public via the Government Point of Entry (GPE), https://www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of all interested parties to routinely monitor the GPE for additional information pertaining to this requirement. TSA will not keep a list of firms responding to this notice; accordingly, interested parties will not be placed on a source list, receive individual notices of updates to the GPE, or receive separate notification of the release of a solicitation. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.</p>

This also includes features such as grade control riffles, temporary erosion control features, and appropriate woody debris and vegetation for stabilization. The length of the new stream channels will be about 450-feet in length. A notched weir structure across the pond where a beaver dam currently sits would be constructed. This structure would ensure that current water levels and fluctuations are maintained. This structure would consist of a sheet pile wall that would be covered in glacial stone, woody debris and/or vegetation to make it look more natural. The small notch would allow a continuous flow down through the created stream channel. The length of the control structure is about 320-feet. Finally, the restoration of native vegetation communities in any area that is directly affected by the dam modification, stream channel formation and water draw down would be implemented. Appropriate vegetation communities would be planted according to hydrology. These are anticipated to be marsh, wet meadow and wet forest type communities. The total area affected is about 4-acres. Existing metal culverts would be replaced with 36" RCP pipe that would allow vehicles and people to walk the path without fording these small seep streams. By replacing the culvert, stream channel connectivity, hydrology and hydraulics would be restored. Appropriate native seep vegetation would be planted as well. This measure also ensures seeps would remain stable after the dam is bypassed.&nbsp; The classification code for this procurement is North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 237990, with a business size standard of $33.5M.&nbsp;COMPETITION IS UNRESTRICTED TO BUSINESS SIZE.&nbsp; The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a firm-fixed price construction contract.&nbsp; The estimated price range for this project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.&nbsp; Interested Contractors can download the Request for Proposal package from Internet Site <a href="http://www.fbo.gov/"><span style="COLOR: #05509e">www.fbo.gov</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>on November 24, 2009.&nbsp; The due date for proposals will be on January 4, 2010 at 4:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time. &nbsp; Requests made by telephone, fax or e-mail will not be honored.&nbsp; The point of contact is Kim M.

<DESC>RECOVERYTHIS ACQUISITION IS EXPECTED TO BE FUNDED BY AMERICAN RECOVERY ACT FUNDS.<BR><BR>The project includes the installation and testing of a subsurface seepage management barrier augmented with an injection/extraction well system, located near the barrier, adjacent to a window area.  The barrier will have approximate dimensions of 60-80 feet in depth and 1,000 feet in length.  The seepage barriers exact length and depth will be determined using detailed field data. It is anticipated that installation of the seepage barrier may prove difficult due to subsurface geologic conditions at the project area.  Subsurface conditions consist of limestone sequences characterized by variable hardness qualities, which have undergone secondary dissolution. The method of installation may require creative excavation and installation techniques. Other project work includes installation of monitoring wells with heat-pulsed flowmeters, constructing a 10-ft by 12-ft control building to house electrical controls and panels, completing electrical work and utility coordination with FP&L and AT&T, construction of well pumps and discharge piping system, constructing walkways for westward well access, and improving the bench area for site access. Access to the project site could be from State Rd 997 (Krome Ave.) and/or from U.S. Highway 41 (Tamiami Trail) by S-334 or S-356.  The staging area for trailers and equipment is primarily east of S-334 and north of L29 canal as shown on the drawings.  The Magnitude of Construction is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.

<DESC>Tri-Service Northwest, Southwest and Pacific Regions, collectively referred to as Logistical Support Area West (LSA-West), initiate the standardization process for Holding Chamber products for its 35 Army, Navy, and Air Force medical facilities in Washington, Alaska, California, Hawaii and Pacific islands.  The product line consists of holding chambers with caps in neonatal, pediatric, and adult sizes. This is new product line initiative for the LSA West Region.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize products or product lines obtaining the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price based on volume pricing discounts utilizing a best value determination process. Standardized products will be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. <BR><BR>The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the LSA-West region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the region are met and help identify possible candidates (i.e. like product items) for elimination, as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.<BR><BR>The Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the LSA West Region include but are not limited to:<BR><BR>Region 11: Bassett Army Community Hospital, Fort Wainwright, AK; Bremerton Naval Hospital, Bremerton, WA; Fairchild AFB Clinic, Fairchild AFB, WA; 354th Medical Group, Eielson Air Force Base, AK; 3rd Medical Group, Elmendorf AFB, AK; Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA; Oak Harbor Naval Hospital, Oak Harbor, WA<BR><BR>Region 9/10: Naval Medical Center-San Diego, CA; 9th Medical Group Beale AFB, CA; 60th Medical Group Travis AFB, CA; Naval Hospital-Lemoore, CA; Weed Army Community Hospital, CA; 95th Medical Group Edwards AFB, CA; Naval Hospital-29 Palms, CA; 30th Medical Group Vandenberg AFB, CA; 61st Medical Squadron Los Angeles AFB, CA; Naval Hospital-Camp Pendleton, CA<BR><BR>Region 12: Med.

To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PVs to distribute their items. This RFQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the PV Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award. For additional information regarding DSCPs PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR> <BR>The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years. Anticipated selection date is 01/10.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR><BR>The Point of Contact is Rosa Crumpton, phone: 253-968-0898, and e-mail rosa.crumpton@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>Products & Performance Required <BR><BR>The LSA West Region is seeking Holding Chamber Products which at a minimum include the product lines below. Within these regions, this product line has an estimated annual demand of $232,660. This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period.

All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM PST on the specified closing date of this RFQ. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Northwest Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>Evaluation Criteria <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the LSA West Regions.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR>The TPRB intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the TPRB reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. <BR><BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date.The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed in the FBO RFQ.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/ company criteria stated below. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR>1.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: <BR>a. Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b. The vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>2.  Each technical/company criteria below requires additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.  This specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual criterion.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative: <BR>1. Vendors must provide a complete line of Holding Chamber products for neonatal, pediatric and adult patients that are FDA approved and latex free.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  Valved Holding Chamber Products required by the LSA-West (at a minimum) are valved holding chambers which are latex-free and anti-static.  These items are for use with metered dose inhalers to administer aerosolized medication to asthmatic patients.  NOTE:  Vendors:  Please state that you can provide a complete product line and provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.).  In addition, send any applicable product literature in response to this RFQ.<BR><BR>2. The valved Holding Chamber product line must be designed to meet the needs of the following groups:<BR>a. Older child with neurodevelopmental delay - large adult-sized mask for clients that have difficulty obtaining an effective seal with a standard mouthpiece device<BR>b. Infants, child and adult mask designed of soft material that will mold to face with an expiratory valve with low resistance for comfort with minimal deadspace.<BR>c. Tracheostomy tube patient - chamber for delivery of medication<BR>d. Mechanical ventilator patient - chamber for in line delivery of medication<BR><BR>3. Vendors must have a DAPA, or be in the process of applying for a DAPA, for the Valved Holding Chamber Product Line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR><BR>4. Vendors must have a separate agreement with LSA-Wests Prime Vendor (currently, Cardinal Health is the PV for distribution in LSA-West.)  Please provide documentation of your companys agreement with Prime Vendor.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the Regional PV will be disqualified.)<BR><BR>5. Vendors must offer volume discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Where FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA. Vendors that fail to offer a discount off the DAPA price will be disqualified.<BR><BR>6. Vendors products must have been tested using USP methods normalizing the dose for the following pMDI formulations: All current pMDI medications are HFA formulations; except for Combivent CFC. <BR>a. Advair HFA<BR>b. Albuterol HFA formulations<BR>ProAir HFA<BR>Proventil HFA<BR>Ventolin HFA<BR>Xopenex HFA<BR>c. Albuterol / Atrovent [Combivent] formulation<BR>d. Atrovent HFA<BR>e. Flovent HFA<BR>f. Qvar HFA<BR><BR>7. Instructions for use of this product must be consistent with recommendations for Holding Chambers according to the AARC Clinical Practice Guideline: Selection of an Aerosol Delivery Device for Neonatal and Pediatric Patients as published in Respiratory Care 1995; 40(12):1325-1335. Vendor will provide this information in the response to this solicitation.<BR><BR>8. Vendors mouthpiece and large masked products must have a flow signal to indicate when inspiration is too fast.<BR><BR>9. The valved holding chamber products must have an inspiratory flow valve to indicate the beginning of inspiration.<BR><BR>10. Vendor must provide a valved holding chamber designed specifically for children, not an adult holding chamber modified for pediatric use.<BR><BR>11. The design of the chamber must minimize the need for hand-breath coordination.<BR><BR>12. The chamber must have a one-way valve between the chamber and the patient to protect and hold the dose of medication before inhalation.<BR><BR>13. The mouthpiece of the chamber must come with a cap attached to the chamber by a tether for safety and cleanliness between patients own use.<BR><BR>14. The inspiratory valve of the chamber must be designed with low resistance to enhance opening and drug delivery and be secured in place for safety and proper function.<BR><BR>15. The chamber must have a baffle in the holding chamber to maximize a fine particle dose.<BR><BR>16. The chamber must have a universal back piece that will accept all MDIs (metered dose inhalers).<BR><BR>17. The chamber must be capable of being cleaned and air dried and not manually dried.<BR><BR>18. The chamber must be assembled in a way that prevents the parts from being lost or broken during disassembly and cleaning.  Please provide a copy of the procedure for cleaning your product that includes:<BR>a. How often your company recommends the product be cleaned<BR>b. Patient friendly instructions in various languages with a list of the languages<BR><BR>19. Vendor must provide educational tools or materials for this product line.  Please list the tools available to staff and patients in response to this solicitation.<BR><BR>20. Vendors must have a local vendor representative in the Northwest Region, Southwest Region & Pacific Region that can provide assistance at regional facility locations.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.<BR><BR>21. Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for items in their Holding Chamber product line, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  <BR>a. Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  <BR>b. Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.<BR>c. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.  Additionally, the Government will not contact any points of contact that are provided in response to this question.<BR><BR>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Price Analysis Process: <BR><BR>Vendors determined to be acceptable based upon evaluation of their Technical/Company Criteria response will be asked to provide samples and their price discount quotes. The request for samples (see the sample set identified below and that appears in the FBO) will be concurrent with the request for price discount quotes (which will include the vendors full product line)<BR><BR>1. In the pre-source selection procedures above, the CPT developed a list of items from the product group to evaluate. The determination of the sample set was based on advances in technology, patient safety, and on historical usage for the product line. The CPT also determined that the clinical/performance evaluation will be performed in a non-clinical setting.  <BR><BR>2. The following procedures will apply: <BR>a. The TRBO office will request a no charge clinical evaluation sample set from each of the vendors with a required delivery date 14 days from date of request. <BR>b. Each vendor will send the samples directly to the participating MTFs at the addresses listed at the end of this announcement. <BR>c. All email communications between vendors and the LSA-West concerning sample set shipment will be digitally signed.<BR>d. Vendors who do not meet the deadline for sample arrival will be disqualified from the standardization process.<BR>e. Due to the potential for samples to become lost or delayed in shipping, all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor, and anticipated delivery date. <BR><BR> The samples to be provided are as follows:          <BR><BR>Mouthpiece Valved Holding Chamber with cap (Latex-free, anti-static, valved): Quantity (5)<BR>Optional mask pediatric size:  Quantity (5)<BR>Optional mask adult size:  Quantity (5)<BR><BR>3. The CPTs will evaluate each product against the clinical/performance criteria. All criteria will carry equal weight.  The evaluations will take place in a clinical setting.  <BR><BR>4. The evaluation responses will represent a clinical value judgment placed in a Likert-like scale with a 1 to 5 scoring format (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree or no; 3 = Undecided; 4 = Agree or yes; 5 = Strongly Agree).  Comments will be invited and recorded on the evaluations.<BR><BR>5. The CPTs have set a clinical acceptability threshold target at 3.1.  The CPTs will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative  at or near 3.1  depending on the location of any break (or gap) in vendors average scores.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold of 3.1 in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT developed, validated, and approved the following equally weighted clinical/performance criteria.  Criteria will be evaluated one time in a non-clinical setting by at least one clinical product team member at each participating facility.<BR><BR>1. Clear, easy to follow instructions are provided for assembly and operation of the product in both English and Spanish. <BR>a. Rationale:  Due to our beneficiaries varying educational levels and products that are used in both home and medical treatment facility environments, clear and easy to follow instructions for proper assembly and operation of devices are required.   <BR>b. Evaluators will read the insert provided with the product and evaluate whether instructions are clear and easy to follow.<BR><BR>2. The product furnishes a good oral seal for inhalation.<BR>a. Rationale:  A good oral seal is required for proper and effective administration of medication.<BR>b. Evaluators will simulate an oral seal using their forearm and evaluate whether a good seal is obtainable.<BR><BR>3. Product can be easily cleaned/maintained in a home environment.<BR>a. Rationale:  Due to varying home and field training environments of our patient   beneficiary population, products that can be easily cleaned and maintained are required.<BR>b. Evaluators will read cleaning/maintenance instructions accompanying the product and evaluate whether products can be cleaned/maintained in any setting.<BR><BR><BR>Pricing Analysis:  Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be asked to provide their price discount quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total LSA West Regional requirement concurrent with product sample request.<BR><BR>1. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the LSA West Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (PST), fourteen (14) calendar days or as described after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.  The impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements. <BR><BR>2. The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  <BR>a. Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);<BR>b. Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   <BR>c. Impact of Unmatched Lines [i.e., unmatched lines require the Region to either substitute a less than optimal item or pay DAPA or possibly open market prices to obtain the item]; and<BR>d. Consideration of SKUs by each vendor intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. <BR><BR>3. Those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from further consideration.<BR><BR>4. Vendors will forward pricing to the Lead TRBO, and the Lead TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the individual Region TPRB.  Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<BR><BR>5. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.<BR><BR>6. The individual Regions TPRB reviews the data to support a selection of the best-value, lowest-overall-cost quote. The individual Regions TPRB votes for the best-value, lowest-overall-cost alternative for a single vendor selection.  The DSLs review the basis for the selection and approves the selection.<BR><BR><BR>Rules of Engagement: <BR><BR>a. Standardization Evaluations will be conducted in areas designated by the TRBO.<BR>b. Clinicians will use an evaluation tool, which will be collected by the TRBO.<BR>c. CPT members can have no invested personal interest in the outcome in a standardization effort. <BR>d. CPT members will be familiar with the specific guidelines for accepting gifts and incentive type items from vendors.  Any violations of the guidelines will be reported to the appropriate officials.  <BR>e. The TRBO will perform statistical analysis of data obtained from the evaluations.<BR>f. Vendors will deliver products to designated location and specified time as agreed upon by the vendors and the TRBO.<BR>g. Vendors presence will not be required during this evaluation.<BR>h. When participating in a standardization effort, vendors must contact the TRBO prior to contacting any clinical personnel in reference to the product being considered for standardization. <BR>i. Additional education or training on the selected products will be at the vendors expense. <BR>j. All evaluation methods will have a start and stop date set by the CPT that will be strictly enforced.  <BR>k. The government is not responsible for cost of sample items, shipping of these items, or any costs associated with the clinical evaluations.<BR>l. Only products selected by the CPT will be reviewed during an evaluation.  All other products presented during the evaluation will be rejected.<BR>m. Unless specifically requested by the TRBO, NO COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE SHOULD SPEAK TO ANY HOSPITAL STAFF MEMBER OR TPRB MEMBER REGARDING PRICE OR PRICE-RELATED FACTORS.<BR>Failure to comply with any of the rules of engagement described above may result in disqualification of your company from further consideration.  Please do not hesitate to contact our Clinical Analyst at 253-968-0898 for questions.<BR><BR>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: The US Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions & LethalityContracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager, Maneuver Ammunition Systems is issuing a Market Survey for information and planning purposes only for the XM1037 5.56mm Short-Range Training Ammunition (SRTA). This does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The XM1037 5.56mm SRTA must provide a realistic training alternative to service ammunition in the M4/M16 and M249 family of weapons. The XM1037 5.56mm SRTA must have a maximum range of 600 meters and a round to round dispersion similar to that of the M855 when impacting E-type silhouettes at 100 meters and F-type silhouettes at 50 meters. In addition, the ammunition must provide full functionality in the aforementioned weapons within a temperature range of -4F to 104F without any ancillary equipment or weapon modifications. The XM1037 5.56mm SRTAwill be used for individual and collective live fire training scenarios in which lack of fixed facilities and/or Surface Danger Zone (SDZ) restrictions prevent the use of service ammunition. The XM1037 5.56mm SRTA will allow for various training scenarios that replicate battlefield conditions while allowing the use of adjacent training areas due to its reduced SDZ. The XM1037 5.56mm SRTA will be a frangible round that can also be used in live-fire shoot houses that will result in reduced wear hence reducing facility maintenance cost when compared to service ammo.

SPECIFICATIONS:   The Technical Data Package for the XM1037 5.56mm SRTA is proprietary and not available for public release. The Government is developing a Performance Specification for the XM1037 5.56 mm SRTA, which will be classified Distribution D (Authorized to the Department of Defense and DOD contractors only).  

PLANNED ACQUISITION:   The requirement is for a Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) production contract for the period of Fiscal Year (FY) 11 - FY15.  Each production year shall have several quantity ranges from a minimum of 300,000 each to a maximum of 3,000,000 each. 

SUBMISSION INFORMATION:   All responsible interested sources are encouraged to submit their capabilities/qualification data.

Belvoir, Virginia, is conducting a market survey for the Small Tactical Optical Rifle Mounted (STORM) micro-Laser Range Finder (mLRF) STORM.   The STORM is a weapon-mounted multi-function laser system that provides eye safe laser range finder, digital compass, infrared (IR) and visible aiming lights, and an IR illuminator for far target location. As the STORM continues to develop, continuous improvement in range, accuracy, weight, and power performance is expected.  The STORM enhances the Soldiers ability to see, acquire, and target. These three functions are essential to allow the mounted and dismounted Soldier to have the ability to acquire objects of military significance with sufficient resolution to detect, recognize, and/or objectively identify those objects before they themselves are acquired.  <BR><BR>Sources within the United States are sought for innovative and light-weight solutions for weapon and vehicle mounted operational systems. This announcement is issued for informational planning purposes only. Submitting information for this announcement is voluntary, and participants will not be compensated.<BR><BR>STORM Characteristics:<BR>The STORM development program reflects a rapid acquisition strategy developed by PM SMS.

General Requirements.  This research will build upon the PyroHand instrument development project conducted at North Carolina State University.  The focus will be on burn injury to the fingers, and the development of improved sensors which accurately, realistically, and reproducibly assesses burn injuries to the fingers.<BR><BR>b.	Specific Requirements:  The Contractor shall conduct  research on and a background Study of the Finger, determine if the current sensor is sufficiently insulated to achieve an accurate heat flux measurement. The one goal of this task is to validate the current sensor, or, develop alternate designs and/or materials for a sensor.  Evaluate heat flux measuring devices that focus on cylindrical heat flows.  Determine how the human finger reacts in flash fire exposures.  The current PyroHand burn algorithm makes assumptions about human skin properties that may not be valid when reduced to an individual organ like the finger.  Determine the effect of core heating of the human finger when exposed to a heat flux.<BR><BR>Implement design changes and fabricate eight (8) new sensors for the middle finger of the PyroHand.<BR><BR>Implement changes to the Burn Algorithm reflecting research on human skin properties and behavior associated with the finger, specifically the finger differs from the hand in being smaller and cylindrical.  Heat data collected from testing with appropriate sensors will be used to develop an accurate and effective burn model for fingers.<BR><BR>Implement changes to the finger burn algorithm into the software code for the PyroHand instrumentation.  Finger burn damage to be included in the total burn values calculated when testing gloves.  A deliverable under this task is a standalone executable of the hand and finger burn algorithm and burn injury prediction plot.  This software will allow the government to input data containing time and heat flux variables and obtain the same graphical data available when using the PyroHand sensors.<BR><BR>Validation and Testing:  Following development of the finger sensors and burn model, the system will be validated, and proofed with a series of tests on a variety of gloves provided by the government, with various weights and materials.  Testing will measure whether the new sensor and model can accurately discriminate between different glove compositions.  The behavior of the various gloves analyzed will be studied to determine how specific glove types might protect hands in realistic fire scenarios.<BR><BR>Responses to this sources sought announcement will not be considered as a response to any solicitation, a request to be added to a prospective offerors list, or to receive a copy of any solicitation.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought

A.	General Information.  

The Northeast Region (TRBO Reg. 1), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 47 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia including institutional and operational healthcare settings announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of ANESTHESIA BREATHING CIRCUITS.  This product line includes but is not limited to the Anesthesia Breathing Circuits which help facilitate and enhance infection prevention and control efforts in the healthcare setting, reducing the opportunity for cross-contamination. The current infection control guidelines for anesthesia breathing circuits require single-patient use or high-level disinfection of breathing tubes, y-connectors, and reservoir bags.
The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.

The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Unit’s (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.

The major facilities in the Northeast Region include, but are not limited to Walter Reed Army Medical Center (Washington, DC), National Naval Medical Center (Bethesda, MD), Malcolm Grow Medical Center (Andrews AFB, MD), Dewitt Healthcare System (FT Belvoir, VA), Keller Army Community Hospital (West Point, NY), and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center (FT Meade, MD). 

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIA’s) that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding DSCP’s Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.

The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three one year (12 months) option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is March 2010.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.    However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  
Point of Contact: Toni Massenburg, (202) 782-3666, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil.  

B.	Products & Performance Required.  

The Northeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of ANESTHESIA BREATHING CIRCUITS, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $273,726.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.

At the request of the Northeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Vendors.  

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to Toni Massenburg, (202) 782-3666, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil or  Tracy Martin-Tilghman, (202) 782-3663, tracy.martintilghman@us.army.mil as a back-up.  Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  

This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Northeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  

The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.  The TPRB votes for the best value for a single or multiple vendor selection(s).  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  

Phase I – Technical/Company Evaluation Process:  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to toni.massenburg@us.army.mil by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price proposed package discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  In general, “acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendors’ responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of “technical acceptability.”  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:
1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Anesthesia Breathing Circuit products.  A ‘complete line of product’ is defined as the MTF’s requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  
a.	At a minimum, this product line consists of a complete line of sterile, standard circuit configurations and a full line of single-use anesthesia breathing circuit components in both adult and pediatric sizes, regular and expandable tubing, as well as adult and pediatric single-limb circuits, HME/HEPA filters, bags, masks, connectors, gas sampling lines, oxygen and suction tubing, and yankauers.   Vendors are required to supply items listed below.

b.	Vendor MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (manufactured and/or distributed by brands) via catalog, and product literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply items listed in all sizes, lengths, configurations, accessories, and components to meet all of the procedural needs.  (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).
2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the Anesthesia Breathing Circuits product line.  Vendor MUST provide DAPA number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  
3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, the prime vendor is Owens & Minor) for Anesthesia Breathing Circuits in the Northeast Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.)  Vendor MUST provide supporting documentation (four digit code) of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal. 
4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.
5.	Vendor MUST provide all history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for Anesthesia Breathing Circuit products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recall during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.   
6.	Vendor MUST provide competent Anesthesia Breathing Circuit products that are mandatory to the safe and effective delivery of oxygen and anesthetic gases to the patient and are safe, reliable, and meet ISO and ASTM standards that are an integral part of the purpose for the Anesthesia Breathing Circuits.  Vendors MUST identify these features of their products that provide for patient safety and provide literature to support this in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.
7.   Vendor MUST provide latex safe/free products.  Vendor MUST provide list of all latex  
      safe/free items supplied such as catalogs, etc. in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.


Phase II Plan – Clinical/Performance Evaluations and Pricing Analysis Process:
Clinical/Performance Evaluations
1.	Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent directly to the to the CPT members at participating Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs), and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the participating MTF address by COB, 5:00PM EST, (14) calendar days after the notice to ship.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline to deliver the product samples by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Note: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and final delivery date of the product sample sets.  
2.	Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendor’s product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical/patient care setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable.
3.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for twenty-one (21) calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.50 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.50 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.50, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval).
4.	To determine acceptability, the CPT, comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Northeast Region will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a clinical/patient care setting. 
5.	Vendors will ONLY provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  Vendors who bring in other product samples or literature on items that are not part of the evaluation process will be disqualified from the evaluation process.  Vendor’s presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to the evaluations.  Vendors WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE PRESENT during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitor’s products.  
6.	Vendors will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or price–related factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or price–related factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process.

Clinical/Performance Criteria:  
1.	The CPT identified that the standards of care that the Northeast Region medical communities adhere to, specifically related to Anesthesia Breathing Circuits, are those that will be the basis for specific technical/company and clinical/performance criteria.  The standards are set forth by the following: 
a. Recommended practices for cleaning, handling, and processing anesthesia equipment.  AORN Journal, 01 Apr 05.  Anesthesia equipment is a potential vector in the transmission of microorganisms. Proper handling and processing of medications, supplies, and equipment can reduce the risk of infection to the patient. These recommended practices provide guidelines for the handling, cleaning, disposal, and reprocessing of anesthesia equipment and instrumentation.

i.	Recommended Practice IV - Single-use items (eg, breathing circuits, endotracheal tubes, filters, needles, some LMAs, stylets, suction catheters, syringes) should be used once and discarded in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations. 
ii.	Recommended Practice V - Anesthesia equipment should meet performance and safety criteria established by the practice setting and that is consistent with the manufacturer's written instructions.     

        b.  American Association of Nurse Anesthetists’s (AANA) Infection Control Guide, Part 
        III:  Infection Control Procedures for Anesthesia Equipment, under Breathing Circuits and    
        Bacterial Filters:
i.	 Bacteria circulates throughout the patient circuit and has been shown to grow and prosper inside the absorber and accessories.  Gas flow through the inspiratory side is initially clean and dry, but bacteria from the patient is present in the moist environment of the expiratory side. As a result, a change of breathing circuit and rebreathing bag is necessary to prevent the transfer of bacteria from one patient to another.
ii.	 A bacterial filter placed between the y-piece and the mask or tracheal tube serves to protect the patient and the anesthesia delivery system from contamination.
iii.	A bacterial filter attached to the inhalation side of the patient circuit is effective for trapping and collecting organisms that may be present in the inspiratory limb of the breathing circuit. Attaching a bacteria filter to the expiratory inlet of the ventilator prevents the spread of bacteria through the expiratory channel and out into the room. This helps reduce the risk of infections being spread to the staff and of cross-contaminations between patients.
iv.	Each bacterial filter shall be removed at the end of every case and disposed of in an appropriate manner to prevent the spread of bacteria. To minimize water accumulation in the filter, which may increase resistance to flow in the patient circuit, bacterial filters shall not be reused or reprocessed nor used for prolonged periods of time without vigilant observation of the airway pressure gauge and airway pressure monitor to detect and correct any problem that may develop as a result of fluid accumulation in the filter housing.

      Anaesthetic and respiratory equipment - Conical connectors: Part 1: Cones and 
      sockets. (Anesthesia):  Devices Affected:
		i.  Anaesthetic and respiratory equipment -- conical connectors. Breathing 
                           circuits, ventilator tubing, tracheal tubes, tracheostomy tubes, bronchial tubes, 
                           PEEP valves, anesthesia gas machines, ventilators, manual emergency 
                           ventilators, powered emergency ventilators, airway connectors, bacterial filters, 
                           respiratory gas humidifiers, airway connectors and nonrebreathing valves.

     d.  American Society of Anesthesiologists:   Recommendations For Infection Control For  
     The Practice Of Anesthesiology (2nd Edition):
i.	 There are insufficient clinical outcome data to support the routine use of bacterial filters for breathing circuits or anesthesia ventilators at this time. A filter should be used on the anesthesia breathing circuit between the patient's airway and the Y-connector prior to contacting a patient with or at high risk for having pulmonary tuberculosis.
      e. ASTM F1690 - 96(2004) Standard Specification for Humidifiers for Medical Use— Part           1:  General Requirements for Active Humidification Systems:     
ii.	This specification includes requirements for the safety and performance of active vaporizing and nebulizing humidification systems, as defined in 3.1.6, suitable for inclusion in breathing systems (both intubated and non-intubated patients).
iii.	This specification also includes requirements for breathing tubes, including heated breathing tubes (heated-wire breathing circuits), and devices intended to control these heated breathing tubes, heated breathing tube controllers.
iv.	Reference documents:
1.	F1054 Specification for Conical Fittings                                                                  F1205 Specification for Anesthesia Breathing Tubes
2.	F1463 Specification for Alarm Signals in Medical Equipment Used in Anesthesia and Respiratory Care

ISO 8835-2: 1993(E) Inhalation Anesthesia Systems-Part 2: Anesthetic Circle Breathing Systems
f.	Comparison of manufacturers' specifications for 44 types of heat and moisture exchanging filters by J. Dellamonica, N. Boisseau, B. Goubaux and M. Raucoules-Aimé, British Journal of Anaesthesia 2004 93(4):532-539; doi:10.1093/bja/aeh239.
i.	Technical aspects of the tests, international standards, and independent validation should be considered when a filter is chosen.
ii.	Many authorities recommend the use of a bacterial and viral airway filter during anaesthesia to prevent cross-contamination and reduce the need to change breathing circuits.
iii.	Some bacterial and viral filters also allow humidification and heat-exchange.
iv.	The two standards for breathing system filters are the International Standards Organisation ISO 9360-1 and the European standard norm EN 13328-1.
a.	The International Standards Organisation standard ISO 9360  set the following humidification characteristics of heat and moisture exchange filters (HMEF): 
1.	Control of humidity at entry into the filter; temperature; duration of the test (24 h); gas flows (30, 60 and 90 litres min–1); tidal volume (250, 500, 750 and 1000 ml); and resistance at the end of the test. 
2.	HMEF must be bacteriologically clean and made to conform with ISO or European standards and good manufacturing practice.
3.	A high-performance HMEF might also prevent moisture accumulation in ventilator circuits.
v.	During anaesthesia, the role of humidification is less clear and microbial filtration capacity more important. 

Clinical/Performance Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below:   

1.	(Staff Efficiency of Care/ Patient Safety) The light weight corrugated and expandable tubing is of adequate length and retains memory when extended for ideal positioning.
a.	Clinicians require the product to resist cracking, ripping, and tearing; expand to allow for a turn of 180 degrees; and retain memory for ideal positioning.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting by use of the product on at least (3) patients.
c.	Evaluator will open/remove product from packaging, easily extend the tubing into proper position, and check for any signs of cracking, ripping, or tearing.
d.	 Evaluator will observe that the tubing retains its memory.
e.	Evaluator will extend the tubing to allow the operating platform to be turned at least 180 degrees.

2.	(Staff Efficiency of Care/ Patient Safety) The soft, air-inflatable cushion is ergonomically designed, has a clear body for superior view, and has an inflation valve that allows the cushion to be easily adjusted to provide a safe and conformable fit.
a.	Clinicians require that the product is engineered with a secure-fit air cushion mask to provide an optimal seal with minimum pressure.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product on at least (3) patients.
c.	After applying the mask securely over the mouth and nose with the adjustable strap, the evaluator will examine for any leakage.

3.	(Staff Efficiency of Care/ Patient Safety) The product’s single limb swivel connector eliminates kinking problems and helps reduce torque at the patient end.
a.	Clinicians require that the product effectively prevents kinking problems, making repositioning of the circuits easier.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product on at least (3) patients.
c.	The evaluator will examine the swivel connector with the naked eye and determine if there is any torque or kinks.

4.	 (Staff Efficiency of Care) The product is easy to set up and connect to the anesthesia gas machine and endotracheal tube.
a.	Clinicians require that product come in a complete kit reducing the necessity to gather and assemble extra components and that the tubing is easy to connect to the gas outflow of the machine and the patient.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting by use of the product on at least (3) patients.
c.	The evaluator will open/remove products from the packaging without having to assemble any of the components and attach to the anesthesia gas machine and endotracheal tube.  Evaluator will observe the ease of performing the task.


Pricing Analysis Process.  Upon completion of the Phase I – Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technically acceptable will be qualified/invited to provide their their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Northeast Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by COB 5:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). 

The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three one year (12 months) option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendor’s products, and the products that could not be matched.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  (4) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.   Operational Impact of RIA prices on the Northeast Region are considered more important than other pricing elements.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE USED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Electronics and Electrical Engineering Laboratory (EEEL), Optoelectronics Division (OD), seeks detailed written responses to this notice from responsible sources that are capable of providing focused ion beam and scanning electron microscope (FIB/SEM) microscopes. Only manufacturers of new equipment need respond.</p>
<p>This equipment is commonly found in research facilities concerned with the preparation of samples for transmission electron microscopy, and the precise modification of electronic circuits. The most common objects viewed or modified in the EEEL OD division are silicon electronics, metals, and other materials with variations on size scales smaller than a micron. In order to provide advances in measurement science for the electronics and electrical community, it is imperative that the microscope provide the ability to characterize and alter materials on the nanoscale level. The Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and the FIB/SEM form one of the most powerful combinations for this goal. In particular, the FIB/SEM allows for the preparation of samples with TEM inspection. In addition, the FIB/SEM allows for advanced materials characterization and modification through the use of Gallium ions and electrons to remove or add material on nanometer size scales.</p>
<p>An acquisition for a FIB/SEM that will be initiated after market research is completed will utilize the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding.</p>
<p>NIST seeks information from responsible sources that manufacture or sell a FIB/SEM that (a) meets the definition of "Commercial Item" in FAR 2.101 (see https://www.acquisition.gov/far/current/html/Subpart%202_1.html#wp1145507) and meets or exceeds the following DRAFT specifications:<br />1. General Requirements</p>
<p>a) The ability to prepare TEM lamella including extraction<br />b) The ability to do basic patterning with the ion beam<br />c) The ability to accept at least 100mm (4") standard Silicon substrates</p>
<p>2. Electron Optics:</p>
<p>a) A thermionic Schottky field emitting electron source<br />b) The ability to externally control the electron beam scan<br />c) The ability to detect secondary and backscattered electrons</p>
<p>3. Ion Optics:</p>
<p>a) A Gallium Ion source<br />b) The ability to externally control the ion beam scan</p>
<p>4. Gas Deposition:</p>
<p>a) The ability to selectively deposit a conductive element for the protection and affixing of lamella from a precursor gas</p>
<p>5. Manipulator:</p>
<p>a) The ability to move with at least 100nm resolution<br />b) The ability to measure strain and digitize the data</p>
<p>6. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy</p>
<p>a) A cryogen free Si drift detector capable of detecting x-rays from the sample and creating<br />elemental maps of samples.</p>
<p>Requested Information to be Included in Responses to this Notice:<br />1. Please indicate whether your company manufactures or is an authorized reseller/business partner for an FIB/SEM of any kind and, if so, please provide complete commercial specifications for the FIB/SEM that your company manufactures or sells, including the name of the company that manufactures the FIB/SEM, where it is manufactured, and detailed functional and performance specifications that the product meets.<br />2.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a High Resolution Sector Field Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (HR-ICP-MS) instrument which is required for interference free ICP-MS determinations of both total elemental content and isotopic composition.  The diversity of sample types encountered from the wide range of projects at NIST demands a technically advanced and flexible HR-ICP-MS.  Low-, medium-, and high-resolution modes of operation, allowing for 300, 4000, and 10,000 mass resolution measurements are required.  The HR-ICP-MS must handle sample concentrations ranging from ultra-trace, parts per quadrillion levels, to levels in excess of several parts per million.  Measurement linearity of > 1012 and detection sensitivity of > 1 x 106 cps/ppb is also required.  Samples may be analyzed in solid, liquid or gaseous form requiring novel sample introduction techniques (i.e laser ablation, liquid chromatography and gas chromatography) that place even further demands on the flexibility required of the HR-ICP-MS instrument.  The complexities of environmental and biological samples require high resolution in order to resolve isobaric interferences, but also require that low resolution, quick scan methods be available to rapidly screen elemental composition and possible interfering species. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the HR-ICP-MS that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.

<DESC>RECOVERY:  The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing several ultrahigh-resolution instruments based on scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) and focused ion beam (FIB) SEMs capable of accurate imaging, dimensional and compositional characterization, analysis and ion-beam milling of a wide variety of biological and non-biological conductive and non-conductive samples. These instruments must work at the nanometer scale, and in certain working modes shall provide resolution and accuracy at essentially atomic scale, i.e. close to or better than 1 nm even at very low electron landing energies. Due to the required high accuracy and repeatability, combined, dual beam instruments, equipped with high-accuracy (laser interferometer) sample stages are generally thought to be suitable for the tasks NIST has to fulfill. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a system that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order utilizing FAR Subpart 13.5.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

This contemplated procurement is anticipated to utilize American Reinvestment and Recovery Act funding if it is determined that responsible sources can satisfy the requirement.

NIST has a need for a system that would meet the following requirements:
Ultra high resolution SEMs and FIB SEMs capable of two-and three-dimensional nano-scale characterization of wide variety of samples. The capability of the microscope must include ultra high resolution (< 1 nm) imaging capability in the 1 keV to 30 keV landing energy range and better than 2 nm resolution at very low landing energy (< 500 eV). The SEMs shall be capable to be the base instruments for multiple analytical detection systems such as energy dispersive x-ray detector (EDS), wavelength dispersive x-ray detector (WDS), scanning transmission electron microscopy detector (STEM), electron backscatter diffraction system (EBSD), Everhart-Thornley detector (ETD), in-lens/through-the-lens detector. For sample preparation and small-scale fabrication purposes they shall be capable of working as a dual-beam instrument. For highly accurate dimensional metrology purposes at least one SEM shall be equipped with sub-100 picometer resolution laser interferometer sample stage with the stage stepping distances at or close to two nanometers. The ion beam imaging and milling capabilities shall include <5 nm resolution; full range of beam energy and current suitable for bulk removal to nano fabrication to surface cleaning; fully integrated user interface for SEM and FIB imaging; TEM sample preparation utilities such as micromanipulator and automated software; gas injection system; and additional imaging detectors such as CDEM detector.

<DESC>RECOVERY:  The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a “two-beam” system including a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a high-resolution focused-ion-beam (FIB), both with advanced direct-write capabilities. The system will be used primarily for maskless fabrication of three-dimensional micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS), nano-photonic devices, nano-plasmonic device, and nano-optomechanical devices. This will be achieved by two-beam-enabled methods such as FIB milling, ion- or electron-induced gas-assisted etching, and ion- or electron-induced gas-assisted deposition. System will also be used for cross-sectional imaging, construction analysis, top-down and cross-sectional metrology, nano-wiring, and preparation of lamellas for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It will also serve as a platform for in-situ experiments involving real-time electrical and optical sample probing under simultaneous imaging or writing by SEM or FIB. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a dual-beam system that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order utilizing FAR Subpart 13.5. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

This contemplated procurement is anticipated to utilize American Reinvestment and Recovery Act funding if it is determined that responsible sources can satisfy the requirement.

NIST has a need for a dual-beam system that would meet the following requirements:

1. Ion beam accelerating voltage should cover at least the range 500V to 30kV. Ion-beam current should cover (in discrete values) at least the range 1.5 pA to 20nA. Best achievable ion-beam resolution at the FIB-SEM coincident working distance should be no less than 5nm (at 30kV and at an ion current no less than 1.5pA). 
2. Electron beam accelerating voltage should cover at least the range 350V to 30kV. Electron beam resolution at the FIB-SEM coincident working distance should be equal to or better than 1.0nm at 15kV, equal to or better than 1.6nm at 5kV, and equal to or better than 2.5nm at 1kV. 
3. To enable adequate management of the ion or electron dose delivered to the sample, it must be possible to switch from SEM imaging mode to FIB imaging mode (or FIB imaging mode to SEM imaging mode) without initiating a beam scan. 
4. Stage should provide motion in at least 5 axes (x, y, z, tilt and rotation). Range of motion in x and y directions, respectively, should be at least 150mm, with a landing repeatability of at least 1 micron. For maximum processing flexibility, possible tilt angles should cover at least the range -10 degrees to 60 degrees.
5. In order to facilitate setup of in-situ electrical and optical probing experiments, routine method for sample loading and unloading must not involve a load-lock, but must take place via a large, single door providing access to the vacuum chamber. 
6. System should include a gas delivery system for beam-induced gas-assisted deposition. Deposition gases must include a gas for deposition of platinum, a gas for deposition of gold, and a gas for deposition of an insulator. 
7. System should include a gas delivery system for beam-induced gas-assisted etching. Etch gases must include xenon difluoride (for selective etching of silicon), and a gas for selective etching of carbon-based materials (such as polymers, photoresists, or diamond). 
8. System must be furnished with an in-situ mechanical probe allowing extraction of FIB-prepared samples such as lamellas for TEM microscopy.
9. System must provide a built-in library of “shapes” which define useful or routine geometries and scanning strategies for FIB milling, ion- or electron- induced gas-assisted deposition, and ion- or electron-induced gas-assisted etching.
10. Provided shape geometries must include square, rectangle, circle, ellipse, circular ring, elliptical ring and polygon. 
11. To maximize process latitude, writing of FIB and SEM shapes should be achieved via an integrated digital pattern generator of resolution no less than 16 bit. Minimum dwell time must be no more than 25 nanoseconds.
12. Shape properties should allow for specification of which beam (ion or electron) is to be used during shape execution. When shape is executed, system must automatically switch to specified beam. 
13. During shape execution with a given beam (FIB or SEM), the system must be able to collect and display, as a live image, the secondary or back-scattered electron signal generated by that same beam. This live image should preferably be displayed within the graphical boundaries of the shape. In particular, this live-imaging feature is necessary for endpoint control during FIB milling of features not in the line of sight of the SEM (such as the bottom of a high-aspect-ratio hole).
14. Live imaging with the SEM should be possible during shape execution with the FIB. Live imaging with the FIB should be possible during shape execution with the SEM.
15. To maximize ease of use and process repeatability, shape size must be expressed in absolute (micron) dimensions, and not nominally depend on system magnification setting at time of execution. 
16. To minimize hidden side-effects, shape position must be referenced only to center of the field of view, not to a stage position. 
17. To avoid offsets, shape rotation must be achieved via the digital pattern generator, not via temporary rotation of the scan field. 
18. To maximize ease of use and process latitude, shape properties must allow for independent specification of horizontal and vertical pixel spacing, in absolute dimensions. 
19. For precise management of dose-rate effects during milling, it must be possible to explicitly specify the slow scan direction used during execution of a rectangular shape, including at least “left-to-right”, “right-to-left”, “bottom-to-top”, and “top-to-bottom” directions. 
20. In order to enable milling, etching or deposition of shapes with complex topography, it must be possible, within a given shape, to specify a dwell time which varies from pixel to pixel. Such a specification must be achievable via use of a grayscale image bitmap.
21. Shape properties should allow for specification of which gas is to be used (if any) during shape execution. System must automatically insert relevant gas delivery nozzle upon launching of shape execution, automatically deliver specified gas during shape execution, and automatically retract nozzle upon completion of shape execution. 
22. System must allow automatic execution of a group of shapes within a same field of view, where individual shapes may have, respectively, different values of dose, dwell time, scan direction, specified beam and specified gas. It must be possible to explicitly specify the order of execution of the shapes. The full list of shapes ready for execution must be apparent, explicit and editable at all times. 
23. System must allow for routine scripting and fully automatic execution of arbitrary, user-defined process sequences involving, but not limited to, FIB milling, ion- or electron- induced gas-assisted deposition, ion- or electron-induced gas-assisted etching, stage motion, SEM image acquisition, and FIB image acquisition. 
24. It must be possible to store a group of shapes under a single name, as well as recall the group at a later time for immediate execution, including via a script.

<p>Responses from responsible sources should clearly establish capability of providing Submicrometer Neutron Imaging Instruments (SNIIs). After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for an SNII that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order utilizing FAR Subpart 13.5 to vendor that best demonstrates that it is capable of meeting or exceeding NIST SNII requirements. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that result will be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>This contemplated procurement is anticipated to utilize American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding&nbsp;if it is determined that responsible sources can satisfy the requirement.</p>
<p>NIST has a need for an SNII that would meet the following general system requirements:</p>
<p>The SNII should resolve elemental or isotopic features (density or composition) within a sample for a planar view using thermal and cold neutron radiation provided at the NCNR. The resolution in the planar view shall be 1 micrometer or less for 1 or more dimensions.</p>
<p>The detection efficiency for neutrons striking the detector and processed by the entire system should exceed 45% efficiency for a thermal or lower energy spectrum. The system should be complete, including all necessary electronics and software necessary to collect data from the imaging device by neutron counting, then record and display the results in near real time at neutron flux rates in excess of 1E+06 n/s/cm2. The neutron sensitive element should be changeable in the detector to adjust the field of view and resolution parameters.</p>
<p>The device will allow simultaneous neutron image collection over a field of view with the dimensions of several micrometers by a few centimeters in area. In addition, the device should have the ability to systematically move the sample in a way that larger views can be obtained by mosaic assembly in the software.</p>
<p>The system should have the means to hold and unambiguously align the sample with the neutron imaging element(s). The system should accommodate significant variations in sample types and dimensions, e.g. few biological cells to hydrogen fuel assemblies. Therefore the preferred system will have the ability to cool, evacuate, heat, etc. the sample during the analysis.</p>
<p>The technical functions of the SNII to be evaluated include:<br />a. Spatial resolution of resultant image to meet or exceed 1 micrometer linear resolution in 1 or more spatial dimensions and at least 30 micrometers in the second dimension.<br />b. Field of View: 1.5 micrometers by 1 centimeter or greater<br />c. Detector efficiency (for thermal neutron equivalent): 75% neutron conversion and 25% of the conversion events recorded or better.<br />d. Exchangeable converters: The system should have the option to replace and exchange neutron converters of different compositions and dimensions (fields of view).<br />e. Gamma sensitivity: The instrument will normally operate in a neutron beam that has gamma and x-ray radiation traveling with the neutrons. Consequently the device should be x-ray and gamma ray tolerant when operated in a typical neutron beam.<br />f. Vibration: The device should be tolerant to vibrations from sources within the instrument and reasonable ambient vibrations at the NCNR site such that the resolution is not degraded below specifications during operation.<br />g. Sample positioning; ability to move sample in x-y plane such that a sequential series of radiographs from a single sample can be joined to form a larger contiguous image of the sample.<br />h. If imaging is accomplished by event counting then coordinates of spatial (X, Y), and time (T) shall be recorded to an electronic file for each event.<br />Requested Information to be Included in Responses to this Notice:<br />1.

<SUBJECT>Compact 2D SAXS (Small Angle X-Ray Scattering) Detector System
<SOLNBR>AMD-10-SS12
<RESPDATE>121109
<CONTACT>Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8448, Email paula.wilkison@nist.gov - Patrick K Staines, Contract Specialist, Phone (301)975-6335, Fax (301)975-8884, Email patrick.staines@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a Compact 2D SAXS Detector System in support of projects in NIST’s Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory. 

MSEL has a requirement for this equipment in order to provide a permanent 2D SAXS measurement option to supplement USAXS studies at the Advanced Photon Source, which will extend measurements to more dilute systems of finer particles or structures.  This will strengthen its capability significantly to do measurements on dilute nanoparticle suspensions with primary particle size <5 nm, and early stage precipitation hardening studies in structural metal alloys and hydrogen embrittlement in pipeline steels.

After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a Compact 2D SAXS Detector System that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.

NIST has a need for an ultracompact, lightweight 2D SAXS detector system to perform small-angle X-ray scattering measurements.  This will form part of an existing compact instrument and will extend current ultrasmall-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) measurements to larger angles (and smaller sizes).  

As such, the required detector:
	
	1.  is NOT necessarily a large area detector centered on the incident beam; the objective is to extend the USAXS measurements with an acceptable solid angle.  Very good signal-to-noise is necessary to have sensitivity to weakly scattering samples containing fine structures.

	2.  is NOT X-ray imaging or radiography; the highest possible energy resolution, image contrast, or spatial resolution is not required.

	3.  is NOT a complete stand-alone system; only the detector and its computer control / data processing storage system are required for use at a synchrotron beam line.

	4.  must NOT require external cooling or gas supply system, as these cannot be accommodated within the space available.


Please include a description of these components and all necessary equipment in order to have a complete user instrument.

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.  Please include your company’s size classification in any response to this notice.  

Companies that manufacture Compact 2D SAXS Detector Systems are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to paula.wilkison@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.  Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 

1. Name of the company that manufactures the detector for which specifications are provided. 

2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the detector, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 

3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 

4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to paula.wilkison@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 

5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

<p><strong><br />DESCRIPTION OF WORK:</strong> This project consists of a new water intake system and transmission main to supply raw water to existing and future water treatment plants for the City of Buckland, Alaska. Buckland is located about 75 miles south of Kotzebue in northwest Alaska. The only access to Buckland is by water or air. The area around Buckland is underlain with permafrost except in the thaw bulb under the Buckland River (raw water source). The Buckland River floods the construction area during spring break-up (generally the end of May and June). No in-water work will be allowed in the river during the period when fish are present in the river (May 15&nbsp;to October 15). It is currently anticipated that an award in Jan/Feb is planned. The Davis Bacon Act will apply.</p>
<p><br />The current design includes a sheet pile cofferdam in the river and the installation of the intake gallery in the dry. Should the bids on the project exceed the funds available for the project, alternative methods for the installation of the intake gallery (ie. directional drilling or horizontal boring) will be considered if proposed by the bidder.</p>
<p><br />This project is contingent on availability of funds.

<DESC>General Notice:  The purpose of this notice is to announce that the Government intends to enter into a contractual agreement with Sea Island Software, Inc. to provide hurricane planning services through the operation and maintenance of HURREVAC.  The Government is interested in determining if any other businesses can provide for the operation and maintenance of HURREVAC as described in this solicitation.<BR><BR>General Information:  The multi-agency National Hurricane Program (NHP) helps protect communities and residents from hurricane hazards through various projects and activities.  Established in 1985, the NHP has also prepared numerous Hurricane Evacuation Studies (HESs) and provided tools and technical assistance to State and local agencies in developing hurricane evacuation plans.  To support the management of HES data, the NHP commissioned the development of HURREVAC (HURRicane EVACuation) in 1988.  For the past 20 years, HURREVAC has been used by emergency managers to assist their evacuation decision making.  HURREVAC is a restricted-use, real time computer program funded by FEMA and USACE.  Its intent is for government emergency managers to track hurricanes and assist in evacuation decision-making for their communities based on information developed during the HES process, and real-time forecast data distributed by the National Weather Service (NWS) and the Tropical Prediction Center/National Hurricane Center (NHC).  The NHP decided to reprogram HURREVAC 2000 to take advantage of the latest Geographic Information System (GIS), programming, and Internet technologies.  As a result, HURREVAC 2000 was converted to the VB.NET program language in 2008 and 2009.  The new generation of HURREVAC is coined HURREVAC 2010.  Based on the HURREVAC User Survey recommendations that were completed prior to beginning the development of HURREVAC 2010, several enhancements were made to improve the intuitiveness, functionality and ease of use of HURREVAC.  The NHP is excited to release HURREVAC 2010 for the 2010 hurricane season and hopes that it meets the expectations and requirements of the HURREVAC user community.  HURREVAC has over 18,000 registered government users at all levels. Therefore, in order to support the transition from HURREVAC 2000 and HURREVAC 2010, the NHP will operate and maintain both versions of HURREVAC throughout the 2010 and 2011 hurricane seasons.<BR><BR><BR>Requirements:  The objective of this Sources Sought is to determine if any other vendor has the experience to operate and maintain both programs, HURREVAC 2000 and HURREVAC 2010, year-round, provide real-time technical support for HURREVAC users, and prepare and conduct HURREVAC training consistent with the goals and objectives of the NHP.<BR><BR>Responses:  Responses should include their current business structures: (a) name of Company  include contact persons name, company address, telephone numbers (voice and fax), e-mail address and (b) Company size (i.e. large, foreign, small disadvantaged, veteran owned, woman owned, etc.).  Also, the submission should include a description of your companys abilities and experience with the above listed requirements.<BR><BR>Responses to this announcement will not be returned.  All submissions will be reviewed based on recent and past performance regarding HURREVAC expertise and experience.  Based on the Governments review, the Government may contact respondents for additional information or ask the respondent to present or demonstrate their proposed methodologies or capabilities to the NHP.<BR><BR>Forward plans of operations and maintenance of HURREVAC services in writing, via e mail to: Lawrence.D.Eastman@usace.army.mil and Michael.J.Schuster@usace.army.mil by 2pm on 15 December 2009. 	<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address:<BR>US Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore, 10 South Howard Street, Baltimore, MD 21201<BR><BR>Place of Performance:<BR>US Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore, 10 South Howard Street, Baltimore, MD 21201<BR><BR>Point of Contact(s):<BR><BR>Contracting POC: Melissa Svetich, 410-962-2290 or Meliss.A.Svetich2@usace.army.mil<BR>

<DESC>The Bureau of Public Debt, on behalf of the U.S. Access Board intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Netco, Inc. for phone system maintenance, services and parts of its Siemens HiCom 150 digital PBX for a base period of six months with two three month option periods.
<p>The phone system call center function is mission critical to provide technical assistance to customers on the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 508. A working knowledge of the Section 508 requirements for telecommunications systems is a mandatory requirement since the Access Board writes the Section 508 requirements for Electronic and Information Technology for the entire Federal government.</p>
<p>Netco designed, installed and has maintained the Siemens phone system for the last seven years as part of the L3 EITS seat contract. They have worked with Access Board to configure and set up the Agency's voice mail system and its automated call distribution group which is one of the mission critical operations for Access Board. The mission critical function is to provide technical assistance using a call center phone function to customers on the Americas with Disabilities Act and Section 508. Netco understands and has implemented Section 508 requirements to the current phone system. A working knowledge of Section 508 requirements for telecommunications systems is a mandatory requirement.</p>
<p>Life expectancy of the Siemens phone system is over as it is approximately seven years old making technical support and availability of hardware difficult to find. The phone system is no longer supported by Siemens, the original manufacturer, however, Netco has over seven years of technical experience servicing this Siemens HiCom 150 PBX and continues to support this phone system by providing service and replacement parts. A functioning phone system is imperative for a Federal agency.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by December 8, 2009 by 2:00pm ET. Responses shall be submitted to PSB3@bpd.treas.gov, Attention GHuffman-JC.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The Government does not intend to pay for any information furnished pursuant to this RFI.  
The Defense Contracting Service Office (Philadelphia) (DCSO-P) seeks your expression of interest and any suggestions regarding DCSO’s desire to establish service support of software/maintenance commercial-off-the-shelf product/solution for Document Automation and Production Service (DAPS) stations worldwide.

This prospective initiative will encompass a next-generation, web-based order management and print workflow solution. The delivery model that best fits DAPS needs is licensed software. Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) is the preferred products. This solution gives ownership and operation of the solution to the Government. Common industry terminologies used to describe similar systems are print e-business and web to print. The goal is to obtain information from vendors who can provide DAPS with innovative, cost-effective, reliable, state-of-the-art solutions and industry capabilities that would fulfill its requirements which are currently being satisfied by the existing solution called DAPS On-Line. DOL is a homegrown application developed using IT services offered through government contracts. A detailed functional, workflow and architectural description of DAPS Online solutions is explained later in this paragraph. DAPS Online is in the sustainment phase of its program life cycle. Yearly evaluation of the technology market resulted in the conclusion that many web to print vendors were able to offer licensed products that would exceed the existing inhouse functionality at an affordable cost of entry. 

DAPS and DAPS customers are satisfied with the functionality provided in the present DOL system.  However, we are seeking all vendors who can provide a COTS solution that meets the existing functionality and provides additional capabilities with their out of box solution. The government realizes, due to our unique requirements, that there will be some RICE items (reports, interfaces, conversions and extensions). These are expected to be minimal. 

.DAPS Online is the primary online tool for customers to access DAPS services. This tool was home-grown and has evolved over the past 11 years. Home-grown is used to describe a system that was developed using a Government contractor based on government requirements. Its origin as a client/server was migrated to a web application in 1998 as internet use became common place. The original tool intent was to provide a means by which customer’s anywhere can submit their print documents electronically to a DAPS facility anywhere. Additional functionality was added as usage increased and dependency on the system grew. The DAPS Online business model changed and expanded into new business areas. The simple job submission tool now offers new services to customers such as “soft proofing” while expanding in house utilization by offering workflow for the production plant, and it supplements our financial system with job level Management Information System reports and data.

DAPS Online is a web-based, e-commerce print solution consisting of a customer order, accounting, plant workflow and reports/management modules. The architecture is a single server comprised of the Operating System, web service application, and database and Java application.  Each regional DAPS Office (10 regional office) maintains their own DOL server. Therefore, the enterprise configuration includes 11 independent web servers located at the following DAPS  regional office sites: Pearl Harbor, HI; Jacksonville, FL; Norfolk, VA; Philadelphia, PA; Oklahoma City, OK; San Diego, CA; Great Lakes, IL; Pensacola, FL; Bangor, WA; and Wiesbaden, Germany. Each of these servers supports 3,000 to 4,000 customers within their geographical area. Each server supports 12-20 subordinate print plants that access the submitted orders through their PC internet browser (Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) 6.0 and higher).  

Functionality being requested includes a licensed COTS solution that is scalable and can provide a retail storefront that is customizable for adhoc users, and a catalog system for specific users, browser-based file submission, kitting, job ticketing, job review, job tracking, approval workflow, split shipping, imposition, API for financial interface, live price quoting, browser-based plant user control, template creation, form filling, and production workflow.  This is not an all exclusive.

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to award a sole source modification under Contract W81XWH-06-C-0359 with Keenan Fort Detrick Energy, LLC (KFDEL), 1301 Gervais, Suite 805, Columbia, SC 29201-3335.  The contract modification will provide for the design, plans, and specifications for an electrical duct-bank to enable the Central Utility Plant (CUP) located at Ft. Detrick, Maryland to expand energy services to additional Government customers at Ft. Detrick.  The construction of the electrical duct-bank will take place under a future procurement action.  The CUP is located on leased Government property within Ft. Detrick.  It is owned and operated by KFDEL.  The duct-bank design is critical to the future expansion of energy services to additional Government customers at Ft. Detrick.  Due to the criticality of the design, it is believed that KFDEL is the best source to complete the design work in order to maintain overall project schedule and mitigate risks associated with the interface of the duct-bank with energy service distribution networks originating from the CUP.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  Any firm that believes it can provide the required duct-bank design should submit written notification to the Contracting Officer within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of publication of this notice.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firms ability.  Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer at: chris.sherman2@us.army.mil.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source contract action.

Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR><BR> The Department of State intends to issue a new Purchase Order for commercial items  Intermec Bar Code Scanners and accessories - for use with the Departments Integrated Logistics Management System.  This procurement is being conducted under FAR 13.5  Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. Teh statutory authority is: 41 USC 253(g) and FAR 13.501, Only One Responsible Source (Brand Name). As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are used as a basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements. A demonstration that the acquisition requires use of the authority cited: 1) WinCE Operating System- more streamlined than WinMobile  2) Assured Radio Deactivation - Assured Radio Deactivation (ARD) is a safety feature that is designed to allow the use of an HHT(hand held terminal) in a radio-restricted hazardous environment, such as around ordnance with electronically triggered fuses.  ARD allows a user to temporarily but securely deactivate all HHT radios, thus preventing them from transmitting, and thereby preventing the HHT from emitting any intended radio energy.  The deactivation is assured because once deactivated, the HHT radios cannot, under any circumstances, emit radiated energy until (re)activated.  Further, the activate and deactivate menu sequences are designed so that they cannot be done unintentionally..  3) NI certified - can be used in explosive environments  4) HERO certified - can be used in RF sensitive areas  5) Secure communications - compliant with Federal Information Processing Standard  FIPS 140-2 certified via Fortress.  6) Smartcard support - allows access management  7) Serial and Ethernet adapter support  8) User accessible snap-on scan handle  9) Ability to (re)set country codes, and (re)deploy units without having to return to a central location10) Firmware automatically disables the WLAN during ActiveSynch.  This prevents network "bridging".<BR><BR>Please note: The CK31G model is different from the commercially available CK31CB model.Key differences:1)Assured Radio Deactivation .  2) NI certified - can be used in explosive environments  3) HERO certified - can be used in RF sensitive areas  4) Secure communications - compliant with Federal Information Processing Standard - FIPS 140-2   Certified via Fortress. 5) Product is only sold directly to the U.S. government by Intermec.6) Country Roaming  channels set at destination by user7) Photo capability in Imager is disabled8) Kit configuration that provides all needed accessories for one price. 
In addition, by switching to a new scanner device, the Department would incur additional costs that would significantly increase the scanner budget. These costs are outlined below:  -	Software Compatibility  The current software is designed to work on the Intermec scanners. Switching to a new scanner model would require the purchase of a new software package as well as customizations to that new package, or the Department would need to develop a new custom application for the scanner. A significant testing effort would be required to ensure all DoS specific requirements are working correctly. Estimated cost: $700,000

The National Institutes of Health
Clinical Center



1.  BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  

The Clinical Center Complex of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is located in Bethesda, Maryland.  The Clinical Center is the hospital of the NIH consisting of 234 inpatient beds, 76-day hospital stations, outpatient clinics, diagnostic and treatment areas, and public waiting areas.  Adjacent to the hospital facilities are research laboratories.  The complex consists of the Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center (Magnuson Center) that covers 661,600 sq. ft. and the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center (Hatfield Center) that covers 698,263 sq. ft.  The Magnuson Center is fifty years old and had a substantial addition completed in 1981 which is called the Ambulatory Care Research Facility (ACRF).  The ACRF is a fourteen-floor structure which houses clinics and research laboratories on twelve floors.  The first and second levels of the ACRF houses clinical services including diagnostic radiology, nuclear medicine and Positron Emission Tomography (PET), surgery, transfusion medicine and laboratory medicine.   

The Hatfield Center opened in 2005 and houses the inpatient units, day hospitals, additional clinics, admissions, pharmacy, social work, rehabilitation medicine departments, staff use areas, support areas and research laboratories.  The Hatfield Center is a seven-story structure with a central large open atrium at the core of the building that connects four separate sectors that house occupants.  Patients are housed on levels 1, 3, 5 and 7 on the southeast, southwest, northeast and northwest sectors of the facility.  Levels 2, 4, and 6 are interstitial mechanical space except for small clusters of offices on the east and west elevator lobbies and atrium portions of the facility.  Research laboratories are located on levels B3, B2, 1, 3 and 5.  The laboratories lead to the southeast and southwest patient care units through distally placed elevator lobbies.


2.  SCOPE OF WORK

The types of patients treated at the Clinical Center range from those who are incapacitated to those who are ambulatory. The aquaria were installed for patients, guests and staff of the Clinical Center and are intended to provide a sense of comfort in a research hospital setting.  Maintenance agreements on aquaria have been in place in the Clinical Center since September 2000.  The responsibility of the contractor is to arrange healthy aquaria and maintain the livelihood and environment of the fish that inhabit the aquaria with oversight by the Clinical Center’s Animal Care Program.  Currently, the Clinical Center requires maintenance on seventeen (17) aquaria, seven in outpatient clinics in the ACRF, and the remainder in the inpatient areas of the Hatfield building.

The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<BR>following standards as compliance:<BR><BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<BR>adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<BR>cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<BR>the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<BR>this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<BR>agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<BR>affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<BR>and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in<BR>those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of wash and wear<BR>materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<BR>not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<BR>laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<BR>of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<BR>there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.<BR><BR>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<BR>Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006,<BR>unless otherwise indicated.

Such<BR>conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<BR>fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by<BR>the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<BR>of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<BR>be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<BR>When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<BR>should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<BR>conformed.<BR><BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR><BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<BR>occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).<BR><BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<BR>proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<BR>proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<BR>rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<BR>authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<BR>representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the<BR>contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<BR>performs any contract work.<BR><BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<BR>of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<BR>information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<BR>and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<BR>for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<BR><BR>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<BR>disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<BR>notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<BR>the request.<BR><BR>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<BR><BR>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<BR><BR>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.<BR><BR>When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of<BR>Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<BR>that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<BR>wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<BR>determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<BR>Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<BR>classifications listed in the wage determination.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK<BR>1.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency. Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format. Submitted quotes shall have the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

ScopeDuring Fiscal Year 2010, VHA Systems Redesign Office and VHA Employee Education System are leading seven separate major national collaboratives  involving at least eighteen face to face learning sessions-each with as many as 250 participants from up to 45 VHA facilities.  Each of these collaboratives is designed to improve access to or efficiency of care provided to veterans.  Each collaborative will involve at least three learning sessions with pre-work and action periods between the learning sessions for the participating facilities supported by coaches and faculty.  Leading all of these seven collaboratives, which has been identified as a priority by VHA leadership for VA to improve our ability to meet the increasing demands for care and to improve efficiency, timeliness and quality of care, involves a significant amount of work to plan and present as well as specific expertise related to the improvement principles required for each of the collaboratives that focuses on a particular aspect of inpatient hospital and/or outpatient care.The focus of this work needed as a part of this contract is for work to be done for Phase II of the Transitioning Levels of Care (TLC) Collaborative.Phase I of the TLC Collaborative occurred in 2009.  During Phase I, we contracted with a vendor to develop content that was utilized for Phase I of the TLC Collaborative.  The TLC Collaborative will continue with Phase II occurring in Fiscal Year 2010.  The vendor that we utilized to develop content for Phase I of TLC performed satisfactorily and has the expertise to make modifications to the content used in Phase I for use in Phase II.  The work that is required as a part of this follow on contract will involve modification to the content and materials developed in phase I, based our experience in Phase I.  This vendor is now aware of the collaborative process, the key players and methodologies used in our collaborative learning model.  It would be inefficient to the government to start over with a different contractor.  It will be most effective use of government resources to do a follow on contract with the same vendor to continue the work that was developed in Phase I of the TLC collaborative.  A summary of the specific work that is needed as a part of this follow on contract for Phase II of the TLC Collaborative includes and will be described in more detail below:"	Modification and expansion of a change package for the Transitioning Levels of Care (TLC) Collaborative, second phase"	Development of an expanded measurement package/tracking spreadsheet/reporting template for TLC"	Development of agendas/worksheets for Phase II of the TLC Collaborative."	TLC Steering Committee and Learning session faculty selection and monthly calls"	Ongoing TLC facility team pre-work preparation and leadership of calls with facility teams"	Ongoing Weekly TLC leadership calls over 9 month Collaborative period"	Preliminary set-up/letters/documents for  Phase II of TLC Collaborative"	Ongoing expert coaching for TLC facility teams "	Reviewing team and coach reports/knowledge management for TLC collaborative"	Selection of Phase II TLC Coaches/coach development calls/faculty for half-day coach optimization sessions"	Ongoing Assistance with TLC E-mail community"	Development of a change package/pre-work guide for the new FY2010 Medical Home Collaborative"	Faculty for Access Partnership LS, VHA Improvement Forum 2010, and How to Run a Successful Collaborative workshop in FY10.  "	.  	2.  BackgroundThe TLC collaborative is a significant strategic priority in VHA and is linked to the VHA priority of improving access to care.  VA has a significant duty to ensure resources are used efficiently to maximize the capacity of our healthcare system to reduce delay and adverse outcomes associated with delays in healthcare.  The Office of Systems Redesign has a significant responsibility to execute a large number of improvement collaboratives, and has been directed the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management to complete these collaboratives in FY 10 to spearhead VHA's efforts to improve access to care.  The VA is continuously under significant scrutiny from outside entities including Congress to show evidence of improving access to care. Delays in care have been the subject of significant recruiting in recent months and years as demand for VA services has increased, especially with many new veterans who need and deserve timely access to care.Successful improvement initiatives require careful, diligent, dedicated time and leadership to ensure success.  Completing improvement initiatives is very challenging.  Changing systems is challenging.  Evidence shows that improvement initiatives are successful only with the appropriate level of leadership given to them.  The planning of this and all collaboratives to be successful must have the dedicated attention of a skilled and experienced faculty person.  Phase I of the TLC occurred in FY 09.  Phase II of the TLC Collaborative will continue into Fiscal Year 2010.  3.	Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR):  Sheri Warren  Employee Education Center, Long Beach, California. 4.

Current VHA practice in this area is highly variable and results in many avoidable days of acute care.  Contractor shall develop/enhance and modify the change package that was used in Phase I and provide an updated written change package to give direction to the work of the collaborative teams in the TLC collaborative, second phase.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 651 Aeronautical Systems Squadron (AESS) (B-52)Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB), Ohio
1.0	Description
1.1 Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) in support of the 651 AESS is seeking information on the capability of existing radar systems as potential replacements for the current B-52H strategic radar system, and on contractors who are interested in designing, developing, integrating, and supporting the test program for a new/replacement radar system for the current B-52H AN/APQ-166 radar.

1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertainin! g to this requirement.
2.0	Background
The Government is investigating the possibility of initiating a B-52H strategic radar replacement program.  The objective would be to identify, integrate, test, produce, and field a replacement radar system to address supportability issues beginning in 2016.
The AN/APQ-166 Mechanically Scanned Array (MSA) radar system currently installed on the B-52H fleet was originally fielded in the 1950s, last upgraded to its present configuration in the early 1980s, and is approaching the end of its useful life.  The antenna assembly has corrosion issues and several components of the radar system are experiencing diminishing manufacturing source/materiel shortage (DMS/MS) situations.  Forecasts indicate that the B-52H radar system will become unsupportable beginning in the 2016 timeframe. 2.1 Planned Production:  A total of 76 aircraft would require retrofit with the new radar system, along with spares and trainers
2.2 Delivery Period:  Initial production kit deliveries in FY 16
2.3 Limitations:  Maximum number of aircraft that may be retrofit in any given year is between 17 and 24
2.4 Security Requirements:  In accordance with established B-52H Weapon System Master Security Classification Guide, 2 September 2008.     For a copy of the Master Security Classification Guide please contact:
    B-52 System Program Office    327th ACSG    3001 Staff Dr.    Ste 2AG19A    Tinker AFB, OK 73145-3021    Action Officer: 540th ACSS/DO    PH: (405) 734-6003

<DESC>This requirement falls within the following NAICS Codes:  541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services and 541512 - Computer Systems Design Services 

Description
This Request for Information (RFI) is being released by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for planning purposes only.  It shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the USDA to acquire any products or services.  If an RFP is issued, it will be officially issued by the appropriate Government contracting office.  The USDA does not intend to pay for the information requested.  All information provided is for Government planning use only – please do not provide proprietary information.
	

Background
The USDA mission is to provide leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, and related issues based on sound public policy, the best available science, and efficient management. The USDA is recognized as a dynamic organization that is able to efficiently provide the integrated program delivery needed to lead a rapidly evolving food and agriculture system. 
Recently, the USDA has initiated modernization efforts to replace and upgrade mission critical systems to improve the delivery of programs that support America’s farmers and rural communities.  USDA has endeavored to streamline and improve program delivery processes to be more effective and efficient.  Also important to the success of the USDA mission is reducing the burden on the workforce, improving program training, design, and administration, and delivering automated access to program applications.
Among the modernization initiatives, is the Budget and Performance Management System (BPMS) project. BPMS is a multi-agency investment in improved processes and tools to improve budget formulation, budget execution, and decision support analytics for participating agencies within the department.  The Farm Service Agency (FSA) is the managing partner for the BPMS project. Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), and Rural Development (RD) are participating agencies.  The National Information Technology Center (NITC) and the Information Technology Services (ITS) organization also maintain models in the same BPMS platform.   
FSA has developed cost and budget models using SAP Profitability and Cost Management (PCM).  The scope of these models includes:
•	Budget Formulation (Salary & Expenses)
•	Budget Execution
•	IT Project Budget Formulation
•	Cost Management
•	Performance Data Collection
FSA is interested in achieving the following modernization goals:
•	Proactively implement analytical practices to enable decision-making. 
•	Align budgets, costs, and performance information to a single business framework.
•	Automate repetitive and manual activities, tasks and processes.
•	Acquire and develop analytical competencies and dedicated roles.

It is anticipated that the future-state solution will be enabled by the PCM solution for cost modeling (i.e. the solution that is already built and in use today), other SAP solution component(s) for budget formulation and execution, and potentially SAP Strategy Management (SSM). In addition to achieving the goals mentioned above, FSA’s intent of this contract includes:

•	Developing a model that other agencies may use for their own budgetary process; or,
•	Allowing other USDA agencies to develop their own model. 

When the BPMS project is complete, FSA expects to have realized the following capabilities: 
•	Management of the Agency’s appropriated funds
•	Management of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC)
•	A modernized work load data collection tool
•	A modernized and automated work measurement (time and attendance) system
•	Strategic planning applications
•	Reporting for annual CFO statements
•	Budget formulation and execution data and exhibits
•	Interfaces with Program Assessment Rating Tools (PART), payroll, human resources and accounting systems, and external systems such as the U.S. Treasury
•	Management decision support and analytical tools 

Type of Contract
It is proposed that this will be a firm fixed price, IDIQ contract.

13.	  Is another NAICS Code suitable for this type of requirement other than 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services  or 541512 - Computer Systems Design Services?  If so, what NAICS code would you suggest and what is your business size standard attached to this NAICS code? 

Bidders be advised:  

1.	The draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) is provided for industry comment.  We request vendors make suggested changes to the document using “Track Changes” for suggested enhancements and recommendations for changes.  Submitted changes/additions may or may not be included in the final solicitation.

<DESC>The US Forest Service is preparing a solicitation to conduct a butterfly autecology study.  

Project Area
The Spring Mountains National Recreation Area (SMNRA). The area is a total of 316,000 acres and is located 30 miles northwest of Las Vegas, NV.

Project Summary and Goals
The U.S. Forest Service (FS) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) work cooperatively under a Conservation Agreement (CA) to protect sensitive species on the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area.  Species managed under the conservation agreement include 8 butterflies endemic to the Spring Mountains.  Four of these species have been identified as priorities for conservation:  the Mt. Charleston blue butterfly (Icaricia shasta charlestonensis), Morand’s checkerspot (Euphydryas anicia morandi), Spring Mountains acastus checkerspot (Chlosyne acastus robusta), and Spring Mountains dark blue butterfly (Euphilotes enoptes purpura).  Autecology studies to understand the life histories of these species and habitat requirements need to be completed to assist in conservation of the species.  Understanding the basic biology of these butterfly species is imperative for sound management decision making on the SMNRA.  

Goals of the project –

The butterfly management areas described below would be used to develop a comprehensive plan to better understand the ecological relationships of these sensitive species.  The first deliverable for this project would be the completion of  a work plan which would provide guidance throughout the project in order to implement the work listed below successfully. 


•	Define and describe habitat and life stages for each butterfly species, i.e., what plant species are used as larval and nectar host plants, what densities of host plants are needed to support each butterfly species, and how the different life cycles (egg, larva, pupa, and adult forms) of the butterflies interact with the host plants and other habitat parameters.
•	Determine what portions of plant populations butterflies are using and why.  Provide answers to what characteristics are present in those preferred areas.
•	Demonstrate how habitat can be restored to yield these characteristics and preferred habitats.
•	Understanding butterfly population structure is an integral part of species management.  The FS and FWS need to understand the metapopulation dynamics of priority butterfly species, i.e., including how many butterflies compose a healthy population, what subpopulations are the most important  “core” colonies that must be preserved and how quickly butterfly species disperse through the landscape to maintain the population.  
•	The FS and FWS need to understand potential ecosystem threats to these species (for example non-native species invasions, shading of host plants through succession, altered fire regimes) and potential prescriptions that forest managers can implement to better manage habitat.

The Government anticipates that this announcement will result in the award of up to four (4) contracts to provide services to each of four (4) primary locations:  (LOCATION 1 - 171st ARW, Pittsburgh IAP; LOCATION 2 - 193rd SOW, Harrisburg IAP; LOCATION 3 - 111th FW, Willow Grove ARS; and LOCATION 4 - PAARNG, Fort Indiantown Gap); in addition to supporting locations/activities on a statewide basis.  Accordingly, each contract will cover a Location, but may also result in the issuance of task orders for locations/activities throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  By making a submission for a Location, the submitting Firm acknowledges that task orders may be issued for other locations throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Interested Firms must indicate the Location(s) for which they are submitting.  Since proximity of a Firms office for its project team and its knowledge of the locality as it pertains to design and construction methods of military projects in the geographic area where anticipated work will be accomplished is an evaluation factor, interested Firms submitting for more than one Location must make multiple submissions with the Firms office location and key project team tailored to each Location.  The A-E IDIQ contracts that are anticipated to be awarded will each be for an initial base year period with four (4) one year option periods.  Individual Delivery Orders anticipated to be issued under the A-E IDIQ contract may include Delivery Orders under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and Firms are advised that under such circumstances RECOVERY Act reporting requirements and contract clauses will be applicable to the Delivery Orders. The Architectural and Engineering Services for which Delivery Orders may be issued may include: a). Design of new facilities or utility systems of various types, sizes, and complexities; b). Rehabilitation of existing facilities or utility systems of various types, sizes, and complexities; c). Design of projects on Army or Air Force installations; d). Application of Anti-Terrorist/Force Protection criteria; e). Sustainable design utilizing LEED rating tools; f). Preparation of the development of the technical information for design-build Request for Proposals; g).  Development of construction cost estimates and schedules; h). Design of Demolition; i). Comprehensive planning that is related to future construction requirements on military installations; and j) Construction phase services including commissioning, shop drawing review and preparation of O&M manuals.  <BR><BR>EVALUATION:  The Governments selection of the best value contractor(s) is based upon an integrated assessment of the below factors / selection criteria in descending order of importance (unless otherwise stated) to determine the most highly qualified firm(s).  Each factor will be assigned a rating from Exceptional to Unacceptable, based on the risk to the government that the firm will successfully perform the contract in view of the factor being evaluated.  An overall consensus rating will be given to each submission.  Factors listed will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows:  SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT  meaning that the factor is at least two times greater in value than another factor; MORE IMPORTANT  meaning that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater; EQUAL  meaning that the factor is of the same value or nearly the same as another factor.  FACTOR 1 - Personnel (Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services)  evaluates the individual experience of the persons that are to be assigned to the project team.  Firms should provide information for one to three individuals from each design discipline that is anticipated to be assigned to key positions on the project team.  The key positions should include:  Project Managers; Quality Assurance Managers; Architects; Structural Engineers; Civil Engineers; Mechanical Engineers; Electrical Engineers; Fire Protection Engineers; Geotechnical Engineers; Environmental Engineers; and Land Surveyors.  Firms may provide information on other personnel they feel are significant for the types of work described in the SCOPE OF SERVICES.  FACTOR 2 - Specialized Experience and Technical Competence  evaluates the experience of the Firm and project team in completing projects requiring skills similar to those anticipated for the AE IDIQ Contract(s).  FACTOR 3 - Past Performance (previous 5 years)  evaluates the Firms performance on contracts with Government Agencies and Private Industry in terms of Cost Control, Quality of Work, and Compliance with Performance Schedules.  FACTOR 4  Work Management (capability to accomplish work in the required time)  evaluates the ability of the Firm to, given its current projected workload and the availability of key personnel, to accomplish a project(s) within required time periods.  FACTOR 5  Firm Location & Locality Knowledge (Location of project office in general geographical proximity to one of the following:  (a) LOCATION 1 - 171st ARW, Pittsburgh IAP, (b) LOCATION 2 - 193rd SOW, Harrisburg IAP, (c) LOCATION 3 - 111th FW, Willow Grove ARS, or (d) LOCATION 4 - PAARNG, Fort Indiantown Gap; and knowledge of the identified locality)  evaluates both the distance of the Firms project office from the LOCATION and the extent of the Firms knowledge of the LOCATION and knowledge/experience concerning state, county and local requirements for projects of the types anticipated for the A-E IDIQ Contract(s).  FACTOR 6 - Volume of Department of Defense (DoD) Awards (during the preceding twelve (12) months)  in the interest of equitable distribution of work, evaluates the volume of DoD work awarded during the twelve month period immediately preceding the date of this announcement.  FACTOR 7  Small Business Participation  evaluates the degree to which a Firm identifies and commits to the use of small business concerns as prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner.  FACTORS 1 & 2 are each weighted EQUAL and are each, individually, MORE IMPORTANT than FACTOR 3, 4 & 5 which are each weighted EQUAL.  FACTORS 1 & 2 are also SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPORTANT than FACTORS 6 & 7 which are weighted EQUAL and which will only be used as tie-breakers among firms that are otherwise essentially technically equal.  Relative to FACTOR 5  Location & Locality Knowledge, it is recognized that for firms with multiple offices, a project team may be formed from personnel from more than one office.  The Source Selection will consider the performance risk associated when a firms project team(s) is not co-located in the same office.<BR>  <BR>SUBMISSION FORMAT:  Three (3) completed and bound paper copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format on CD are required for each submission.  A separate response (SF 330) MUST be submitted for each LOCATION for which the submitting Firm wants to be considered AND clearly identify the LOCATION.  Submitting firms are to include the DUNS number along with the name of the firm in Block 5 of the SF 330, Part I, Section B.  A firm located within the United States may obtain a DUNS number by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://www.dnb.com/us/.  If a submitting Firm is located outside the United States, the local Dun and Bradstreet office should be contacted.  Relative to all submittals, FONT SIZE shall be at least 10 point or larger (MS Word Font Size 10 for Times New Roman, Arial and Courier New fonts are examples of the minimum acceptable Font Size).  Except as otherwise indicated, pages shall be 8-1/2 inches by 11 inches.  Where page limits are indicated for Parts/Sections of the SF 330, excess pages will not be read or considered.  Each side of a sheet of paper shall be counted as a single page.  Blank sheets or tabs separating the sections within the SF 330 will not count toward any page limitation.  The Organizational Chart required in Section D and the Matrix required as Section G, may be presented on sheets up to 11 inches by 17 inches.  If an 11 inch by 17 inch sheet is used it shall be neatly folded to 8-1/2 inches by 11 inches and bound in the SF 330 at the proper location.  All key personnel for whom resumes are provided shall be shown on the organizational chart in Section D.  Resumes in Section E shall not exceed two (2) pages each.

A maximum of Ten (10) projects including the prime and consultants will be reviewed in Section F.  No more than one (1) page should be used for each project.  Multiple projects may be reflected on a single page.  When listing projects in Section F, an Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) with multiple Task Orders as examples is not considered a project.  Multiple task orders that are associated with a single project may be used and will be considered a single project; however, listing a single contract with task orders that may be unrelated is not considered a single project.  A task order executed under an IDC contract is a project.  In Block G-26, along with the name, include the firm with which the person is associated.  Section H shall not exceed fifteen (15) pages.  Indication of favorable performance ratings, awards, and repeat clientele in Section H is recommended.  A SF 330 PART II is required for each branch office of the Prime Firm and any Subcontractors that will have a key role in the proposed contract.  <BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.

<DESC>Amendment 1:
The pre-solicitation notice issued on October 21, 2009 is modified to include the following: 
1.  Replace Selection Criterion 1 in its entirety with the following:
(1) Specialized recent experience and technical competence of firm or particular staff members proposed for construction management services of new infrastructure, and alteration, renovation and repair type projects.  Firm's demonstrated recent experience with regard to construction management services of base facilities similar in size, complexity, and dollar value.  Base facilities include, but are not limited to, single or multi-story buildings, high bay structures, masonry, concrete steel, and pre-engineered structures; barracks and dormitory buildings, administrative facilities; educational facilities, libraries, medical facilities, dining facilities; industrial/warehouse facilities; waterfront facilities (piers and wharves); and aircraft facilities (including hangars and aprons), site utilities and infrastructure; ranges and operational/training facilities.  Individual features (barracks, dormitories, administrative facilities, fire/police stations, etc.) do not have to be within a single project scope; however, projects that contain several or all features will be evaluated more favorably than projects that contain only individual features.  Also, projects designed and constructed in environments similar to Guam (remoteness, corrosiveness, and seismic zone) will be considered more favorably.  Describe a maximum of ten (10) relevant projects completed in the past ten (10) years which best describe experience in construction management services of the projects discussed above.  A project or contract is defined as either a stand-alone contract or a single task order, or an accumulation of related task orders under the same IDIQ contract having the features described above.   
2.  Replace Selection Criterion 2 in its entirety with the following:
(2) Professional qualifications of firm and staff proposed for construction management services of new infrastructure, and alteration, renovation and repair of existing infrastructure type projects.  Key personnel are identified as the program managers or project managers that will manage the construction management services described in the contract scope.  Provide up to five key personnel deemed by the firm to be most important to the success of the team.
3.  Reduce the minimum order limit from $25,000 to $10,000.
4.  Amend the statement regarding the selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract to read as follows:
The selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction management services sought under this synopsis in relation to those construction contracts on which they provided design and specification preparation services unless such work is: 1) consistent with any organizational conflict of interest provisions in the contract under which such work was performed; and 2) performed under conditions that fully mitigate any potential organizational conflicts of interest.  Design and specification preparation services includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents (DD1391), facility siting studies, environmental assessments, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost.
5.  Offerors shall submit an Organizational Conflict of Interest mitigation plan if the firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates have access to non-public information as part of its performance of a government contract that may provide an unfair competitive advantage in this competition of the Construction Management Services contract.  Additionally, the offeror shall provide a mitigation plan that clearly addresses the potential conflicts and remedies any potential bias or impaired objectivity that may arise in providing the construction management services outlined in this synopsis.
6.  Submissions of Standard Form 330 must be received and date/time stamped by the Contracting Officer on or before December 18, 2009 at 4:30 p.m. (Guam Time) in order to be considered.  Any submission received after this date and time will not be considered.
7.  Attached Notice 1 is provided in response to requests for information.

The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services at the U.S. Embassy in Kampala, Uganda.

All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract. 

The Project Manager must possess a Level 3 language proficiency, which requires an ability to speak English with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most formal and informal conversations on practical, social, and professional topics.

NOVEMBER 24, 2009--AMENDMENT TO MALABO, EQUATORIAL GUINEA 

NOTICE OF SOLICITATION OF SUBMISSIONS FOR CONTRACTOR PRE-QUALIFICATION, SOLICITATION NO. SAQMMA-10-R0002, ORIGINAL POSTED DATE, OCTOBER 9, 2009, IS HEREBY AMENDED BY THE FOLLOWING CHANGES::

1.  Paragraph 3 Prior Pre-Qualification of Certain Offerors is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

GAO bid protest decisions in Caddell Construction Company, Inc., B-401281 (June 23, 2009) and B-401596 et al. (Sept. 21, 2009) increase the importance of basing prequalification of offerors on current and complete information.  Accordingly, the Department of State is ending its practice of permitting offerors to prequalify based on prequalification for prior projects.  We are therefore reopening the present prequalification to afford potential offerors an opportunity to submit complete Phase 1 submissions.  Potential offerors who have already submitted Phase 1 submissions in accordance with Paragraphs 4 and 5 under Solicitation No. SAQMMA-09-R0069 or SAQMMA-10-R0002 need not resubmit, unless offerors wish to update their submittals.  

2.  The first sentence of Paragraph 6 Closing Deadline for Submissions is amended to read:  ALL SUBMISSIONS MUST BE RECEIVED BY 11 AM, EST DECEMBER 16, 2009.

All other requirements remain unchanged.

<DESC>This amendment to the presolicitation notice adds an invitation for all A&E firms who have the qualifications required to perform the work to submit a completed SF 330.  Detailed information on consultants and subcontractors, if applicable, MUST be included in the submittal.
Please provide the following additional information on the form: Tax Identification Number (TIN) and DUNS number. All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). For additional information, or to register with CCR, access http://www.ccr.gov. 
Additionally, by submission of a response, the offeror represents that it will comply with the reporting requirements in Section 1512 (reports on use of funds) of the Recovery Act as outlined in FAR clause 52.204-11.
Design for Gabrielson Annex and Renovations
A. PROJECT OVERVIEW
Except as otherwise specified herein, the Contractor shall furnish the personnel, materials, services, and facilities, and perform all services necessary to, and incidental to, design work for: 1) construction of an addition/annex to the existing Gabrielson Bldg on the Patuxent Research Refuge (PRR), in Laurel, Maryland.  The new addition/annex will total approximately 44,000 sf. and 2) complete renovation of the existing Gabrielson building. The construction phase of the new building and renovation projects will be packaged for contracting separately. 
Design work is to conform to GSA's Facility Standards for the Public Buildings Service (PBS - PQ100.1).  These facility standards set forth product criteria for new buildings and alterations.
The principals of sustainable energy and low environmental impact design shall be incorporated as extensively as possible into this project. The building shall be designed in accordance with the Department of Interior "Sustainable Buildings Implementation Plan" (Federal Executive Order 13423) and be certified by a sustainable building rating system such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) as verified by an independent third party not affiliated with the project or facility.
The new administration facility will be constructed within the Central Tract headquarters area of the PRR, a proposed historic district composed of historic National Register (NR) eligible buildings and landscaping constructed from 1937 to about 1972. Because the new administrative building will be within the eligible administrative area of the PRR, the new construction should meet the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (36 CFR 68 found at:  http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/tps/tax/rhb/stand.htm ). 
Associated guidelines for new additions to historic buildings contain further information to help design a building that is compatible with the historic district: http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/tps/tax/rhb/guide.htm
Early in the design phase, the A-E will interact with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO).  It must be anticipated that archaeological surveys of the sites will be performed and clearances will be obtained by the Government from the Maryland SHPO after final conceptual site plans have been developed by the A/E and approved by the Government.  
Design services and resultant construction package will include the services provided in a separate statement of work.  For a complete statement of work for this A&E project, interested vendors are required to request an electronic copy from abenton@usgs.gov.
1.  At a minimum, all proposed construction and building system components shall be designed    to conform with, or exceed, the relevant guidelines of the latest version of the following codes and standards:
(a) Facilities Standards for GSA Public Buildings Service - GSA PBS-PQ100.1(b) American with Disabilities Act(c) Architectural Barriers Act(d) American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standards(e) National Standard Plumbing Code (NSPC)(f) National Electrical Code - NFPA 70(g) ICBO Uniform Building Code(h) ANSI/AIHA Z9.5 2003(i) NFPA, National Fire Codes(j) NFPA, 101 LIFE SAFETY CODE(k) Uniform Mechanical Code(l) Underwriters Laboratories Fire Resistance Directory(m) Underwriters Laboratories Building Materials Directory(n) DOE Energy Conservation Standards 10 CFR Part 435(o) OSHA 29CFR 1910(p)Construction Specifications Institute Standards(q) EO 11514 (NEPA)(r) PL 95-217 Clean Water Act of 1977(s) PL 94-469 Toxic Substance Act(t) EO 12088 Pollution Control Standards(u) Applicable portions of 40CFR(v) Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD-12)(w) EO 13508 Chesapeake Bay Protection and Restoration(x) Navy LID (Low Impact Development) Policy(y) Energy Independence and Security Act 2007 Section 438(z) Secretary of Interior Standards for the treatment of historic properties (36 CFR 68)(aa) Secretary if the Interior Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology and Historic Preservation (48 CFR 44716)(ab) Department of Interior "Sustainable Buildings Implementation Plan" (Federal Executive Order 13423)
2. Sustainable Design:  The A/E shall incorporate alternative technologies and materials including but not limited to:
(a) Geothermal heating and cooling systems and other alternative energy sources(b) Solar energy to offset electrical costs(c) Recycled content building materials(d) Building materials derived from renewable resources and local products/materials when possible(e) Native plant materials.
All A&E firms responding to this announcement will be evaluated on the following  criteria:
(1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services;
(2) Specialized engineering experience and technical competence in construction and design, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials;
(3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time;
(4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules;
(5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project.
The successful firm will be awarded a Firm-Fixed Price contract based solely on the data contained in the SF-330, references, and questions and answers of pre-selected firms. Upon successful completion of negotiations with the selected firm, the contract will be issued. This acquisition will be awarded above the Simplified Acquisition Threshold of $100,000.00.

<DESC>Coast Guard Air Station Sacramento requires its assigned aircraft to be regularly washed to help prevent corrosion and to otherwise keep aircraft appearances up to standard. Our existing wash rack system includes 2 boost pumps, 1 large gas fired water heater, plumbing for both hot & cold water and a hise station with 2 hoses ( 1 hot water and 1 cold water) with assosiated reels and nozzles. There are 3 stations to the system. Station 1 contains water line of main water source with 1st boost pump. Station 2 is the water heater and tank and 2nd boost pump. Station 3 is hot and cold water hoses reels and nozzles, 2 back flow preventors and 2 hose pressure sensors that operate drainage controls.

Over the last 2 years we have had a series of problems with our system that has led us to the need to overhaul it. We have had a series of underground plumbing failures, we have also had problems with older gas fired water heater, not only has it required a great deal of maintenance it has also failed emissions with little hope that it will ever be in compliance. Our overall vision is to have all 3 stations collocated with an electric type on demand hot water filteration system with all assosiated hot and cold water plumbing.

This is a Performance Type Contract. The USCG's intent is to recieve from the contractor a "Complete and usuable" product that meets all functional requirements as well as all codes and regulations of applicable govermental agencies.

Contracter must be registered in CCR.

A required walk through will be on 23 Nov.



NOTE: PLEASE HAVE QUOTES TURNED IN NLT JAN 06 2010.

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Information is to search for qualified vendors capable of meeting the Department of Veterans Affairs requirement for Advanced CPRS Forms in support of the Veterans Hospital Association (VHA) Innovations Program.The VHA electronic medical record, known as the Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture (VistA)/Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), has a built-in capability for developing custom electronic forms.  The applications under consideration are all to be based upon an existing Component Object Model (COM) framework for developing and delivering applications to users of the VA's Computerized Patient Records System (CPRS).  CPRS has the capability of being extended by means of COM modules. These are custom programs that enhance and extend the functionality of CPRS.  The Loma Linda VA Healthcare System (LLVAHCS) has developed a versatile and robust framework based upon CPRS's COM technology.  The LLVAHCS CPRS COM Object is a general-purpose CPRS extension that provides us with the ability to enhance CPRS now and in the future without the necessity of deploying additional CPRS COM object DLLs to the workstations throughout the medical center.  We can extend the functionality of the COM object by writing server-side logic that processes client requests and returns content back to the COM object to be displayed to the CPRS user.The four applications to be developed based upon COM technology are VistaForms (iForms), Medication Reconciliation, Automated Clinic Checkout Sheet, and the IntelliNote Diabetes Care Tool.  VistaForms:  The tool used to create custom forms in CPRS is fairly basic, involving a text editor and a list of fields that can be manually added to create a form.  This precludes many users from creating more advanced forms due to the rather primitive tools available for form creation, and thus places the burden for the development of advanced forms on a relatively small number of users and programmers.  The Contractor shall develop a framework for rapidly creating and delivering advanced electronic forms for clinical users within the CPRS environment that would facilitate the continued improvement of electronic clinical documentation in the VA.  The application shall provide a development interface for designing the form interface and implementing business logic within the form.  The application shall also provide a hosting platform for the delivery mechanism of the forms to the clinical user within the CPRS environment. The forms development interface is a standalone application that allows a non-programmer to create forms by means of a drag-and-drop, rapid application development (RAD) interface.  Medication Reconciliation:  Currently, the LLVAHCS uses COM object interface to remind clinicians to perform and document medication reconciliation. Specifically, when a patient is admitted to the hospital, the COM object is initiated at patient selection, requesting completion of medication reconciliation before proceeding further into the patient's record.  The Contractor shall redesign the current COM object medication reconciliation tool to include a medication ordering function.  LLVAHCS COM object would provide a form with a list of pre-admission medications.  At discharge, the discharge pharmacist or clinician can invoke the discharge medication reconciliation COM object that will generate the pre-admission medication list as well as the current inpatient medication list. The clinician or pharmacist will take action on each medication and generate a list of discharge medications.  The COM object-based application will create a discharge medication note as well as a patient-friendly list of discharge medications for the patient.Automated Clinic Checkout Sheet:  The contractor shall develop an application to provide patients with a patient-friendly summary of their outpatient visit or inpatient stay in an efficient and mostly automated manner.  Using COM technology, medication, lab, consult, imaging and text orders in VistA/CPRS would be translated into a readable, patient-friendly instruction sheet.  At the conclusion of an outpatient visit, clinic staff will invoke the COM object through the CPRS templates, a note title or from the CPRS tools menu.  Therefore the discharge instructions will display discharge medications, self-care instructions, patient education, future appointments, orders for imaging tests and other procedures, consults, lab tests and contact information for the patient's primary care physician.IntelliNote Diabetes Care Tool:  The Contractor shall develop IntelliNote as an innovative and unique solution to diabetes care, using COM technology.  The application will incorporate decision support logic that will allow it to provide recommendations to the clinician based upon current clinical guidelines from various sources, including VA guidelines and formularies.  The clinician will take action on the form which will result in the application automatically ordering appropriate labs and exams, medications, and appointments.  This is a request for information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement.  The NAICS code for this effort is 541512.  The period of performance is expected to be 12 months from date of award.

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): Russell Construction Co. Inc., W52H09-08-D-5005-0027<br><br>This notice is for the award of a firm fixed price modification to incorporate 7 change orders into W52H09-08-D-5005-0027 due to differing site conditions.  Subject project was awarded to Russell Construction Co. Inc. of Davenport, IA on July 15, 2009.  The project consists of design, demolition and repair of concrete and structure on the designated area of the old and new sections of the Hydro-Electric Plant/Building 160. The contractor's proposal for this task order was based, in part, on an underwater survey conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers in 2008.  During contractor's own underwater investigation, the contractor discovered a significant void in one of the foundations, a cast iron gate that cannot be repaired, a missing cornerstone, and a scour area that undermines the outlet tunnel.  It was also determined that additional investigations are needed due to inconsistencies with the report provided by the Army Corps of Engineers and the contractor's own investigations to ensure the structural integrity of the dam.  Contract W52H09-08-D-5005 was awarded under full and open competition with the use of best value source selection procedures to Russell Construction Co. Inc. of Davenport, Iowa on August 21, 2008.  The design build and construction services proposed to be awarded under this contract include the type of work designated in this synopsis.<BR>

<DESC>Recovery – Modification 0001 to this BPA call was awarded on 16 Nov 2009 to provide incremental funding in the amount of $960,000.00 and to accomplish an in-scope ceiling increase of $150,792.56. The BPA call ceiling was increased from $1,618,415.44 to $1,769,208.00 in order to accommodate for an approximately 9 percent increase in expected support required.  Due to the unknown level of effort required to meet the contracting and grants and agreement support needs of the Economic Recovery Operations Center (EROC) located in Vallejo, CA, this requirement has been awarded and modified as a time and materials type contract. The labor rates are fixed price; however, the exact number of hours of support required for each labor category cannot be established in advance of the award.

<AWARDEE>Allied Systems Company Inc, 21433 SW Oregon St, Sherwood, OR 97140-9769 US
<DESC>Rationale for sole source procurement:  The installed crane to be replaced is an Allied Systems TB60-64 telescopic marine crane.  Replacement with any other brand/model would require modification to the pedestal/foundation aboard the ship, and update to the ship’s trim and stability calculations.  A crane from a different manufacturer, or a different model of crane would require a new ABS certification including extensive review of the crane and installation drawings.  Additionally, a direct replacement with the same model crane as existing will reduce the installation time such that installation can be accomplished during a Vessel Repair (VR) period rather than requiring a shipyard availability.  This shorter installation during a VR will permit installation during the current fiscal year rather than requiring a Regular Overhaul Or Mid-Term Availability which would likely be January 2012.

<DESC>This award consists of a modification to contract HHSN272200900026C.<br /><br />The purpose of this contract is to provide the full complement of services required, including volunteers, qualified personnel, material, equipment and facilities in which to study the biology of influenza viruses in humans, to examine the host's immune response to these viruses, and to test and evaluate new candidate vaccines for safety, genetic stability, immunogenicity, transmissibility and protective efficacy in humans. Studies will also include the safe administration of wild-type virus to healthy adult volunteers in order to assess pathogenicity, virulence and their suitability for use as a challenge virus in efficacy studies. These wild-type viruses will be used to challenge vaccinated adult volunteers in order to assess the extent of immunity induced by candidate vaccines. Studies will include both adult and pediatric subjects since influenza viruses cause severe respiratory disease in people of all ages. In summary, the requirement is to provide the necessary populations to study the biology and immunology of a variety of influenza viruses and serve as a testing center for the development of new vaccines effective against these agents. This modification will facilitate the initiation of H1N1 related studies under the contract.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rationale for not using a fixed price contract:</span>
<p>A fixed price mechanism is not appropriate for this requirement. Although certain elements of the requirement, such as equipment and subcontracts, can and will be procured on a fixed price basis, the complexities of conducting clinical research are highly variable and dependent on too many external factors to accurately develop a fixed price estimate. Testing, patient care, and administrative costs can fluctuate greatly depending on the number of patients screened and participating in the studies conducted. Overall, the level of risk and number of uncertainties make a fixed price contract impractical and likely less cost effective than a cost-type arrangement.</p>

<DESC>"Recovery" - RML Building 7 Renovation<br />This Project is funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The magnitude of this project is estimated between $ 1 Million and $5 Million. The Building 7 project, located at the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) in Hamilton, MT, consists of the renovation of an existing defunct boiler plant two stories high with a portion of the building a single open bay. The renovation includes demolition and construction of new floor space to infill partial floors and to connect to an adjacent building. The existing floor space is approximately 4,680 ft2, while the renovated floor space will be approximately 7,480 ft2. <br />A significant amount of demolition is required, including removal of 3 boilers with support tanks, piping, and catwalks. There are some existing asbestos containing material and lead based paint. Structural upgrades to meet seismic requirements are included. The Building 7 structure is a combination of steel, concrete and brick, with extensive interior and exterior brick. Existing exterior brickwork will have to be matched for infill. Several central utilities are located in, or pass through Building 7 and these must be kept active during demolition and construction and located in their final locations with only minimal interruptions in service. These services includes, steam, condensate, compressed air, vacuum system, and electrical power. <br />The existing large windows will be replaced. The heating and cooling system will consist of 100% outside air supply air handler units and exhaust fans with building automation system. The building will be fully commissioned and receive LEED certification. The building electrical system will be renovated. The buildings will have fire alarm systems and fire sprinkler systems. The primary purpose of the building is to serve as research laboratory. <br />

<DESC>Low Observable Composite Repair Facility (LOCRF) is an adaptive re-use of an existing hangar, Building 898, to add two self contained paint booth inserts in two of the hangar bay quadrants.  A third paint booth will be inserted into another hangar bay quadrant as a bid option.  Each paint booth will be capable of painting an entire fighter jet aircraft. The paint booths will require connections for fire protection, fire alarm, electricity, compressed air, breathable air and heating and ventilation.  The support spaces on either side of the hangar bay are being converted into shop spaces, administrative spaces, sensitive access spaces, and locker/restrooms.  This renovation consists of demolishing portions of ceilings and walls for the new functional areas; a complete demolition of the existing men's and women's restrooms; new walls, ceilings, furring, new doors and ADA compliant toilets; high expansion foam system as part of the paint booth installation; existing wet pipe system sprinkler heads reconfigured for new spaces; communications runs, mass notification, ACM remediation; and anti-terrorism and force protection measures.  The HVAC on the East side of the facility is being replaced with energy efficient units and the existing 120/208 electrical service from the mains to the sub panels is also being replaced.
