<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is operating a share ofthe United States accommodations on the International Space Station (ISS) as a nationallaboratory in accordance with Section 507 of the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 (P.L.109-155). NASA seeks to increase the utilization of the ISS by other federal entities andthe private sector.  To facilitate and increase such utilization of the ISS, NASA isproviding access to the ISS for the conduct of basic and applied research, technologydevelopment and industrial processing (collectively, R&D) to U.S. federal, state andlocal government entities, and to U.S. private entities (including, but not limited to,commercial firms, non-profit institutions, and academic institutions) as part of thenational laboratory. NASA is soliciting these proposals from two announcements of opportunity.  The firstcall, "OPPORTUNITY FOR THE USE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION BY DOMESTIC ENTITIESOTHER THAN U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES." - NNH09CAO003O anticipates using NASAsauthority to enter into Non-reimbursable Space Act Agreements to support nationallaboratory activities, including providing necessary access to NASA facilities, personneland technical information, however, there will be no provision of funds in connectionwith this opportunity.	This opportunity is focused on U.S private entities and is seeking proposals fromdomestic entities other than U.S. federal government agencies.	This Broad AgencyAnnouncement, however anticipates using NASAs authority to enter into contracts, grants,and cooperative agreements or other transactions to support national laboratoryactivities where funding is required.  Activities related to expanding the use of theInternational Space Station include providing individual payload integration andoperations support services, or by making available support equipment and instrumentationthat expand the capabilities of the ISS.Participation in this National Lab Opportunity will be contingent upon selection by NASAand negotiation of an appropriate Agreement between NASA and the Offeror.  Concepts aresought in two (2) general mission thrust areas: Payload Integration & OperationsServices, and Support Equipment and Instrumentation Capabilities for Utilization of ISS. Responses for any thrust area may be submitted at any time while this solicitation isopen. NASA may publish groups of special topics as modifications to this BAA throughoutthe year. This announcement is not intended to solicit concepts for ISS utilization managementorganizations, or ISS user development support. It is not to be confused with conceptsthat involve the establishment of new institutes, government corporations, non-governmentorganizations, non-profit institutions, strategic partnerships, cooperative agreements,grants, or contracts that involve any form of management organization for ISS-basedutilization. This announcement is limited to the acquisition of products and servicesnecessary to execute specific missions under the ISS national laboratory initiativespecifically to the thrust areas covered by this announcement.

<CONTACT>Dorothy Maxwell, Phone 301-435-0352, Fax 301-480-3345, Email maxwelld@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Illumina Inc., 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, California 92121-1975 to procure HumanExome Beadchip (48 and 288).</p>
<p>1. HumanExome BeadChip (48), Catalog Number: WG-353-1001-PRE, Units: One (1) Each.<br />2 HumanExome BeadChip (288), Catalog Number: WG-353-1002-PRE, Units: Six (6) Each.<br />3. Shipping and Insurance Charge.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institute of Molecular Genetics Section of the Genome Technology Branch has upgraded the genotyping capabilities in the Finnish US Investigation of NIDDM (FUSION) genetics study to increase throughput and versatility as well as lower the cost of high throughput SNP analysis. In increasing the versatility we are able to optimize the type of genotyping reaction to facilitate smaller studies with a large number of samples as well as larger numbers of SNPs on few samples for association discovery studies. The FUSION project is involved in an international consortium studying type 2 diabetes (T2D) and quantitative traits in large study groups representing populations world-wide.</p>
<p>The international consortium is comprised of over 15 independent disease research groups led by principle investigators of the FUSION project, the Diabetes Genetics Initiative at the Broad Institute, and the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. The consortium has collaborated on the custom design of the HumanExome Chip and is using the array to analyze type two diabetes and quantitative traits in the combined cohort of ~149,000 subjects beginning with the initial delivery of the HumanExome Chips. The FUSION study is contributing ~28,000 subjects to this analysis. Skeletal muscle from the vastus lateralis, subcutaneous adipose tissue from the abdomen, and a skin biopsy that can be cultured into fibroblasts will be obtained from 100 FUSION participants with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), 100 with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 100 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics (T2D). A newly designed Illumina exome chip that will score for ~250,000 common and rare variants in exons, using data from the 1000G project as a reference set will be used in the research. Additionally, whole genome methylation analysis will be assessed using the Illumina 450K chip, which examines methylation sites covering 99% of the RefSeq genes and 96% of the CpG islands genome-wide. To obtain digital data on gene expression, total RNA from a portion of each tissue and from cultured fibroblasts will be subjected to RNA-seq. These rich and extensive data sets on the genome, transcriptome, epigenome, and phenome of 300 individuals, to be generated over the course of the next year, will provide an opportunity for multiple complex analyses. Therefore the procurement of these Illumina HumanExome Beadchips are critical to the continued diabetes studies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Place of Performance</span></strong>:</p>
<p>The arrays will be processed at the NHGRI and NIH supported Center of Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) where the processes and expertise in Illumina arrays are well characterized and documented. The HumanExome Beachips will be shipped to John Hopkins University CIDR, Baltimore, Maryland 21224.<br /><br />Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology and the Small Business Size Standard is 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-53 (August 4, 2011). This requirement is under the SAT of $150,000.00.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by November 7, 2011, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2012-019-DLM, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Dorothy Maxwell. Response may be submitted electronically to maxwelld@mail.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted. Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Coordinating plans with various other groups including international donors, the U.S. military and the Government of Afghanistan can be complicated.</p>
<p>Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact other programs. They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.</p>
<p>Physical Demands</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, the work is principally sedentary, however frequent travel in and around, or being stationed in Afghanistan provinces, is likely. While on a site visit there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances - the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Extended onsite visits to remote project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also often a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty,windy, and polluted environments, and frequently outdoors. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty or polluted environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.<br />Period of Performance - The period of performance for this order will be one year from the date of award with the option to renew.</p>

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/SOURCES SOUGHT
RFI: VA262-12-C-0007
QUESTIONNAIRE

If you are interested, please provide the requested information as indicated below.  The contemplated contractual period or performance may be for a base year and four, one-year option periods, which may begin on or about December 1, 2011.  

Company Name (as it appears in CCR):
Point of Contact:
Address:
Phone:
Email:
Company website URL:
Primary NAICS Code:

The Veterans Affairs, Network Contract Office, is seeking sources for a potential contract for a Research and Development Management System. This Software As A Service (SAAS) hosted solution will be the core of the VA Great Los Angeles Healthcare System, Research & Development Department's compliance and tracking system(s) for personnel, projects, training, and animal use. The SAAS should prescribe a modular or object oriented solution. Government anticipates customizations with a likeness to the following:
"	Input
"	Output
"	Network Configuration
"	Report Formatting
"	Interface Issues
"	Chain of Command (for signature routing purposes)
"	Permissions
"	Access
"	User Administration

However, this is not System Development procurement. The SAAS solution proposed shall be Commercially Off-The-Shelf software suite, marketed or sold by brand name. Again, Government is not contemplating a procurement to develop a system. 
	
1.	What is the commercial brand-name of the SAAS your company represents?
2.	So that Government may learn more of your firm's product offering, what is the URL to the product website?








The SAAS solution proposed above shall accommodate the following the compliance areas:

Personnel Management (Module 1):  This tool shall provide functionality to track appointment status for Government employees. Can the SAAS product your firm represents have the capability to comply with the following functions? Check all that apply:
Functions
 	Store Position descriptions.
 	Store appointment status.
 	Generate performance appraisal.
 	E-Mail reminders for appointment extensions.
 	Generate pre-populated forms such as OF-8, IPA contracts, and timesheets.
 	Store emergency contact information.
 	Store all other types of related personnel management data.

Research Project Tracking (Module 2): 
This module is the centerpiece of our compliance. Can the SAAS product your firm represents have the capability to comply with the following functionality? Check all that apply:
Functionality

 	Tracks all research protocol submissions from receipt to approval for all Research and Development Committee and Subcommittee reviews including Institutional Review Board (IRB), Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Subcommittee for Research Safety (SRS), Data Use and Security Program (DUSP), and the R&D Committee (RDC). This includes new projects, modifications to projects, and continuation reviews. 
 	Generates agendas and minutes templates.
 	Based on programmable chain of command generates approval memos for signature
 	Tracks meeting outcomes.
 	Shall track adverse events, protocol deviations, and other unanticipated events involving risk to detect patterns that require monitoring or action.
 	Import/Interface with personnel data from MODULE 1 and tracks employee project assignments, training status, credentialing status, exclusion list, service, committee membership, and any other key compliance-related data. 
 	Sends notifications to Investigators and employees of upcoming training/credentialing requirements.
 	Generates external reports for accreditation requirements governed by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) and Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs, Inc. (AAHRPP).
 	Generates internal reports for research management to use as assessment tools of research activities.
 	Capability to interface with ePROMISe, a proprietary nationwide Government system used to report research activities to Veteran Affairs Central Office (VACO) and synchronizes local approval records within a national database.
 	Capability to interface with Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) www.citiprogram.org website including automatic updates of training records.
 	Interfaces with the VA Training Management System (TMS) training website including automatic updates of training records.
 	Interfaces with Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) exclusion lists and flags those persons that are not permitted to perform research at a federally funded institution.
 	Maintains historical records of project approvals and outcomes, including regulatory categories of review.

Animal Management (MODULE 3): 
This system will be used to track animal use, census, and billing data. Can the SAAS product your firm represents have the capability to comply with the following functions? Check all that apply:
Features
 	Imports animal approval information from MODULE 2.
 	Tracks animal use by protocol, species, and strain.
 	Tracks animal census by protocol number and location.
 	Convert census data to billing data for animal per diems.
 	Generate billing reports.
 	Generate cage cards.
 	Provides management tools for Veterinary Medical Unit staff.

U.S.C. Section 508, Rehabilitation Act: Electronic and Information Technology
Many features of the SAAS Solution described in the Sources Sought must be accessible by keystroke in order to accommodate persons with disabilities. The SAAS solution is not required to be 508 Compliant Certified.  However, the VA fosters a work environment of inclusion and diversity and this aspect of the solution must be considered as it speaks to the "user friendliness" of the system. Can the SAAS product your firm represents compare to the guidelines of U.S.C. Section 508, Rehabilitation Act: Electronic and Information Technology?
 	YES
 	NO

Knowledge Requirement: Offerors should have at least a functional knowledge of the references below. Check all that apply:
 	VA Handbook 1200.01
 	VA Handbook 1200.05
 	VA Handbook 1200.07
 	VA Handbook 1200.08
 	VA Handbook 5005
 	VA Handbook 1058.01
 	VA Handbook 6500
 	Veteran Healthcare Administration Directives

**Important Note: The rationale for the afore mentioned knowledge requirement is the conduction of research at VA facilities differs significantly from other institutions, and the consequences of non-compliance are far greater for federally funded research facilities. It is operationally imperative that Offerors are familiar with the standards outlined in the documents listed above, as this is the core of VA GLAHS federal compliance. 


Size of business pursuant to the following questions: 
1.	Is your business:
 	Large
 	Small
2.	If small, does your firm qualify as one of the following:
 	Small Emerging business

 	Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act 
 	Hubzone 
 	Woman-owned or operated business 
 	Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business
 	Veteran owned small business

<DESC>To support deployed units operating from remote, land-based sites, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) has a requirement to procure integrated energy generation, management, and storage systems; solar/ DC-powered refrigeration systems; and man-portable water purification systems.  In accordance with energy reduction initiatives, NAVFAC seeks to reduce reliance on fuel and water resupply through the use of energy-efficient and renewable energy technologies. 

For each deliverable/ system, responses should provide 1) equipment specifications, 2) performance/ capabilities data, 3) equipment configurations, 4) estimated life cycle costs, including acquisition, maintenance, and other relevant costs, 5) available logistic support packages, and 6) approximate lead times from order to delivery.

The deliverables are: 

1)INTEGRATED ENERGY GENERATION, MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE SYSTEMS 

NAVFAC requires two sizes: 
a) A system matched to the Navys 3kW Tactical Quiet Generator (TQG) providing 1.8Kw of usable power available at any given time, 24 hours a day; and 

b) A system matched with up to 70kW power provided by either the Navys 60kW TQGs or two 35kW generators, with 48kW of usable power available at any given time, 24 hours a day.
 

Tactical generators provide spot power and are sized for peak load, which means the generators often run under a poor load factor and outside of the range where they are most efficient. NAVFAC requires a system that can run currently deployed generators at an ideal load factor and dump the unconsumed power into a load bank. Once charged, the system would utilize the load bank as its primary power source until the power demand exceeded the load banks capacity, at which time the system would automatically restart the generator. NAVFAC seeks to reduce the fuel consumption of currently deployed, inefficiently loaded generators by 70% or more.

The system should also harvest power from optional, renewable energy sources (solar is the primary interest).
  Transportability, ruggedness, and reliability are also system considerations.


2)	MAN-PORTABLE WATER PURIFICATION SYSTEMS
By using local water sources (e.g., wells, rivers and streams) for drinking water, deployed forces can significantly reduce their logistics tail.  NAVFAC intends to procure systems that can purify fresh water to NSF International Protocol P248 standards at a minimum rate of 700 gallons/day. 
The system must take its power from a 110v 15A circuit and an alternative energy source consisting of photovoltaic cells.  The photovoltaic system shall be capable of collecting energy and storing power with no more than 5 hours of peak solar power per day. Wind and water generation methods are unacceptable.
  The system must be transportable by a maximum of two people.


3)SOLAR/DC-POWERED REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS
 To extend the time between resupply missions, NAVFAC intends to procure solar/DC-powered systems providing for cold storage of food and packaged water. NAVFAC will consider systems ranging in size from a minimum of 5.8CF/165L to a maximum of 13 CF/365L.  The systems shall maintain food and packaged water between 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (-1 to 4 degrees Celsius) when operating in ambient temperatures from 55 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 40 degrees Celsius). 
The system must include its own power/refrigeration system that operates independent of operator-provided power generation systems, but must also have the capability to run on 120 VAC.
  If alternative energy collection systems are included, photovoltaic systems must be capable of collecting energy and storing power with no more than 5 hours of peak solar power per day. Wind and water generation methods are unacceptable.


This is a market survey for information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will come from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation.  There is no bid package or solicitation, to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement, if any, that may arise from this announcement.

<SUBJECT>41--DEPLOYED ENERGY-EFFICIENT SYSTEMS
<SOLNBR>N0002512R0004
<RESPDATE>111511
<ARCHDATE>12302011
<CONTACT>Michael Fanizzo; michael.fanizzo@navy.mil
<DESC>To support deployed units operating from remote, land-based sites, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) has a requirement to procure integrated energy generation, management, and storage systems; solar/ DC-powered refrigeration systems; and man-portable water purification systems.  In accordance with energy reduction initiatives, NAVFAC seeks to reduce reliance on fuel and water resupply through the use of energy-efficient and renewable energy technologies. 

For each deliverable/ system, responses should provide 1) equipment specifications, 2) performance/ capabilities data, 3) equipment configurations, 4) estimated life cycle costs, including acquisition, maintenance, and other relevant costs, 5) available logistic support packages, and 6) approximate lead times from order to delivery.

The deliverables are: 

1)INTEGRATED ENERGY GENERATION, MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE SYSTEMS 

NAVFAC requires two sizes: 
a) A system matched to the Navys 3kW Tactical Quiet Generator (TQG) providing 1.8Kw of usable power available at any given time, 24 hours a day; and 

b) A system matched with up to 70kW power provided by either the Navys 60kW TQGs or two 35kW generators, with 48kW of usable power available at any given time, 24 hours a day.
 

Tactical generators provide spot power and are sized for peak load, which means the generators often run under a poor load factor and outside of the range where they are most efficient. NAVFAC requires a system that can run currently deployed generators at an ideal load factor and dump the unconsumed power into a load bank. Once charged, the system would utilize the load bank as its primary power source until the power demand exceeded the load banks capacity, at which time the system would automatically restart the generator. NAVFAC seeks to reduce the fuel consumption of currently deployed, inefficiently loaded generators by 70% or more.

The system should also harvest power from optional, renewable energy sources (solar is the primary interest).
  Transportability, ruggedness, and reliability are also system considerations.


2)MAN-PORTABLE WATER PURIFICATION SYSTEMS
By using local water sources (e.g., wells, rivers and streams) for drinking water, deployed forces can significantly reduce their logistics tail.  NAVFAC intends to procure systems that can purify fresh water to NSF International Protocol P248 standards at a minimum rate of 700 gallons/day. 
The system must take its power from a 110v 15A circuit and an alternative energy source consisting of photovoltaic cells.  The photovoltaic system shall be capable of collecting energy and storing power with no more than 5 hours of peak solar power per day. Wind and water generation methods are unacceptable.
  The system must be transportable by a maximum of two people.


3)SOLAR/DC-POWERED REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS
 To extend the time between resupply missions, NAVFAC intends to procure solar/DC-powered systems providing for cold storage of food and packaged water. NAVFAC will consider systems ranging in size from a minimum of 5.8CF/165L to a maximum of 13 CF/365L.  The systems shall maintain food and packaged water between 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (-1 to 4 degrees Celsius) when operating in ambient temperatures from 55 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 40 degrees Celsius). 
The system must include its own power/refrigeration system that operates independent of operator-provided power generation systems, but must also have the capability to run on 120 VAC.
  If alternative energy collection systems are included, photovoltaic systems must be capable of collecting energy and storing power with no more than 5 hours of peak solar power per day. Wind and water generation methods are unacceptable.


This is a market survey for information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will come from this announcement.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.   THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION AVAILABLE.  For information purposes, the DRAFT Statement of Work will be available online at http://www.fbo.gov/.   The solicitation number for this announcement is W912EE-11-R-0001.  VCO solicits for Capability Statements from all qualified and interested HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, 8(a), and Small Business firms to participate in a Best Value solicitation for operation, maintenance, and repair of flood control facilities managed by the Corps of Engineers at the following project locations: Arkabutla, Sardis, Enid, and Grenada Lakes in the State of Mississippi.  Current funding has reduced the level of effort to approximately $2.0 to $3.0 million dollars per year from previous historical levels in the $7.0 to $8.0 million per year range.  The NAICS Code for the proposed acquisition is 561210, Facilities (except computer operation) support services, and the small business size standard is $35.5 million. The Federal Supply Code is Z299, Maintenance, repair/alteration/all other.  Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 50% of the contract work with their own employees.  The Government will use responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis to make appropriate acquisition decisions to solicit these projects as HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, 8(a), or Small Business set asides.  Proposals will be evaluated using a Best Value source selection process that will result in award of a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract to the responsive responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, offers the Best Value to the Government, technical, past performance, and cost considered.  The Government anticipates awarding a contract for one base year and four option years.  The Government invites contractors with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements as indicated in the Statement of Work to submit Capability Statements consisting of appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and past performance references.  Respondents must include references and a capabilities statement for at least two completed or current projects, for which your firm was the prime contractor (or major contractor) within the last three years of work similar in size, scope, and complexity.  Each reference shall include contact names, addresses,  phone numbers, fax numbers, contract numbers as well  as a description of the services provided, contract type (i.e. fixed priced or cost), and dollar value.  Proof of SBA certification for 8(a) and/or HubZone status must also be included.<br>The capabilities statement for this sources sought is not expected to be a proposal, but rather short statements regarding the company's ability to demonstrate existing or developed expertise and experience in relation to the areas specified in the Statement of Work.  Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the Capabilities Statement.  Submission of a Capabilities Statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participations will assist the VCO in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities.  All qualified businesses are strongly encouraged to submit a capabilities statement.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is neither to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  After completing its analysis, the Government will determine whether to limit competition among HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, or 8(a) firms or proceed with completion amongst all small business firms.  Submissions that do not meet all requirements or submitted within the allotted time will not be considered.  Electronic submissions via email will be accepted, facsimile submissions will not.  Responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis may be emailed to   Tracey Lowe at Tracy.M.Lowe@usace.army.mil or Anitra Wilson at Anitra.D.Wilson@usace.army.mil       or mailed to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg Contraction Office, ATTN: Tracey Lowe, 4155 East Clay Street, Vicksburg, MS 39183-3435.

The objective of the AGSL is to collect and categorize current and future DoD and industry airborne sensor information within a searchable database and data library accessible by the intelligence community. This effort will facilitate planning and development decisions by providing a tool to catalog current and near-term sensor technology systems supporting the airborne ISR mission area. The organization of the data will enable a user to quickly and easily find relevant information on existing and developmental GEOINT sensor technologies. This library will also facilitate future market research, technical feasibility assessments, and rapid identification of possible sensor capabilities supporting Quick Reaction Capabilities (QRC) in response to warfighter urgent operational needs.
<p>The intent of this RFI is to inquire across industry, academia, and service/government programs to provide sensor technology information that will be used to populate our new classified sensor library. Data from this effort will reside on the same classified SIPRNet file server as the Air Force ISR Capabilities and Requirements Tool (ISR-CART).</p>
<p>To help us with entering data into to the AGSL database, ASC/WIN requests that industry, academia and government organizations complete the attached template for each sensor submitted. Key to this effort is also collecting supporting documentation on each sensor. This may include: manufacturer sensor data sheets or brochures, documents describing the sensor, specifications, requirement documentation, briefings, quad charts, photos, movie clips, exercise training manuals, website addresses, operational assessment documentation, cost data, CONOPS, CONEMPS, Interface Control Documents (ICD), example sensor products, etc. The intent is to collect as much background data electronically as feasible.</p>
<p>We invite industry, academia, DoD labs and FFRDCs to submit responses to this RFI (unclassified or classified up to SECRET) on their sensor programs or technology. For our initial stand-up, please submit responses to the USAF as outlined below, by 5 Dec 11. If you intend to respond to this RFI, please provide a heads-up e-mail to WIN.TECHDEC@wpafb.af.mil titled, "Intent To Submit - AGSL".</p>
<p>NOTE: Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) is under contract to develop and populate the library database. GTRI's contract includes an Organizational Conflict of Interest clause governing the use of the proprietary information of other companies. This clause requires GTRI to enter into company-to-company agreements to (1) protect another company's information from unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it is considered proprietary by the other company and (2) to refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished. Those responding to the RFI who desire to enter into a non-disclosure agreement should contact GTRI, 2970 Presidential Drive, Suite 310, Fairborn OH 45324 Tel: 937 427-0125 Fax: 937 427-0499 Email: Stan.Lewantowicz@gtri.gatech.edu, ,</p>
<p>Once populated this library will be updated and maintained by ASC/WIN for the foreseeable future. We anticipate an annual data call (i.e., RFI) to update and populate the AGSL. We invite any new sensor information submission throughout the year, as it is feasible.</p>
<p>--------</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA)
<p>4 November 2011</p>
<p><br />NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE- SOURCE BRIDGE CONTRACT</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source bridge contract under the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii)(B), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. This authority is supported by a sole source Justification &amp; Approval (J&amp;A) which has been posted separately to FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>The Government has conducted extensive market research leading up to development of its acquisition strategy, issuing three Requests for Information (RFI), Reference Numbers 11-10 (December 2010), 11-47 (April 2011) and 11-75 (August 2011) which substantiate the need for the bridge contract discussed below. The industry responses have identified the potential for competition of the Directorate's Aging Surveillance, Excess Ballistic Missile (XBM) and Commercial Launch Vehicle (CLV) mission assurance requirements. As such, a competitive solicitation will be released upon approval of the acquisition strategy to allow for full and open competition of the follow-on requirements.</p>
<p>This sole source bridge contract will allow the incumbent, TASC, Inc., to provide continuing mission assurance support for the aging surveillance and systems engineering support requirements for a period not to exceed 6 months. In addition, the bridge will allow for continuation of work on an inventory control system which was begun under the expired contract. The current contractual vehicle for these critical requirements will expire 31 December 2011. The above represents the only scope that will be procured under this bridge contract. This sole source action will result in a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract with an estimated contract value of $4.95M and an estimated award date of on or before 31 December 2011. The sole purpose of this bridge contract is to ensure these critical mission requirements continue while SMC/PKT provides for a competitive source selection of the follow-on contract in 2012.</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes the only notice for this bridge effort.</p>
<p>This acquisition action does not assume that the incumbent is the only contractor who can provide this MA Support. This action only assumes that there are no other contractors at this time who are capable of providing these services without an unacceptable delay. As stated previously, full and open competition is expected for the follow-on effort, with the solicitation for that competition expected to be released in 2012. Notices regarding that acquisition will continue to be posted to FedBizOpps.</p>

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302, Medtronics, Inc. is the only provider of this service that will satisfy VISN 9 requirements. The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contract Activity, VISN 9 intends to make a sole source award to Medtronics, Inc. with an estimated value of $34,155.00 for a base plus four (4) one-year options for the support and maintenance of its Paceart software for the Nashville VAMC. These services will be used to implement remote diagnostics and corrective procedures to the Paceart system at the Nashville VAMC campus..    

 SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION: Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Medtronics, Inc. is the only vendor of these services that will satisfy VISN 9 requirements. Medtronics, Inc. maintains proprietary ownership of Paceart software. The selection of a different vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency's requirements and adversely affect critical patient care. Services performed by this vendor are essential and provide the only solution to meet the Agency's requirements to maintain consistency and standardization in the provision of cardiac care. Analysis indicates other companies' similar services do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the Agency's needs. The government would incur undo substantial cost and risk by using a different vendor. The cost to compete in an attempt to procure different services does not out weight the benefit of maintaining our current standardization and consistency within the Agency. 

The estimated cost for this requirement is $34,155.00.
 
This notice of intent is neither a request for quote nor a solicitation of proposals. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates an ability to meet the agency's needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to Paul E. Keller no later than November 7, 2011 @ 13:00 pm Central Standard Time.

<DESC>Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use:  Contracting Activity:  The National Park Service, New England Major Acquisition Buying Office, (NE MABO), Boston National Historical Park, Charlestown Navy Yard, Building I, Boston, MA 02129-4543.  Description of Action:  This approval is being requested to extend the term of the contract, No. C1700 07 0103 with Roc Caivano Architects, by three months from November 19, 2011 to February 18, 2012.  Description of Supplies/Services:  NE MABO anticipates the need to issue a firm-fixed price task order for Title III architectural and engineering, (AE), services relative to, Phase I Rehabilitation of Wildwood Stables at Seal Harbor, Acadia National Park, Bar Harbor, Maine.  The estimated value of the order is under $10,000.  Additionally, this extension may apply to other task orders that may require Title III services where Roc Caivano Architects is the designer of record.2.  Sole Source Justification rationale  (Check one and explain below):___X___Only one responsible source.  Authority Cited:  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1).  The citation FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The subject contractor has intimate familiarity with the required Title III services due to the fact the firm developed the specifications relative to the project and therefore has a unique capability to perform the post award construction oversight.  Additionally, the firm will be required to provide stamped, AE as-built drawings and is uniquely qualified to perform this task as the firm is the designer of record.   At this time acquisition planning has begun to synopsize a new requirement for professional AE services.  The NE MABO anticipates posting the synopsis within the next 30 days, however, it is anticipated that contract award may take up to 90 days.  No actions will be taken to increase competition, for this particular requirement, due to the fact Roc Caivano Architects is the only source that can provide the services described herein.  Market research has been performed relative to the follow-on AE contract and will be relied upon for the future synopsis.

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest.<BR><BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated.?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Scissors Bandage Utility. The Medical Material Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) North is the lead MMESO for this proje</strong>ct. <br /><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor (s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.</strong>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Portsmouth Naval Hospital, Womack Army Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital, Ft. Benning, GA; MMESO West: Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (PV) program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO region, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA TS Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anticipated selection date is February 2012.</span></strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <br /><strong>Points of Contact: Ms. Toni Massenburg, MMESO North, Team Leader, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil and 571-231-5451 and Ms. Gail Tucker-Carlisle, MMESO North, Clinical Analyst, gail.tucker-carlisle@amedd.army.mil.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Scissors, Bandage Utility. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $233,290.66. This forecast is based on historical usage during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, twenty-one (21) of the total forty six (46) line items, account for 75.8% ($176,884.43) of the total volume in sales ($233,290.66) in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ms. Toni Massenburg, Team Leader, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil and Gail Tucker-Carlisle, RN, Clinical Analyst, gail.tucker-carlisle@amedd.army.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO North that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO North via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor, who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></span></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO North reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. Vendors must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will be disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an email communication.

Services provided under this contract are subject to the Privacy Act.  

A record keeping system of Contractor's hours worked will be established.  The security guards will be required to phone into the Memphis VA police Control Room at the start and end of each of their shifts. Failure to do so will result in mismatch between the Contractor's time sheet records and that of the VA's, which would result in disapproval of the invoice for that time period.

During winter months, it will be dark by the time the clinic closes and security presence will be critical.  Normal operating hours are planned from 7:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. (10 hours per day); therefore security coverage should be provided 12 hours per day, 6:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.

<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. This solicitation requires offerors of such products to submit all drawings, specifications, or other data necessary to enable the government to determine whether the alternate product is either identical to or physically, mechanically, electronically, and functionally interchangeable with the product specified. This statement warns offerors that the failure to furnish all necessary information may preclude consideration of the offer, stating that the alternate product will be considered technically unacceptable, if acceptability cannot be determined before award.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Facsimile Number (703) 806-8866 or 8875 Packages sent by FEDEX or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Ft.

<DESC>The AF Safety Center (AFSC) at Kirtland AFB, NM is requesting information to fabricate a display stand to mount a metal space debris object to display in front of their building. The stand will support a hollow metallic sphere with the following dimensions: circumference at the top is approximately three feet, the height is approximately 3.5 feet, and the base is approximately three feet. The weight of the object that the stand will support is approximately 140 pounds. The object will be placed in a stand that is suggested to be circular and be approximately four feet in height with supports that will withstand winds in excess of 70 mph and resistant to corrosion. The stand should also have the capability to rotate so all areas of the space debris can be viewed (this requirement may be waived if it's too difficult or costly). The stand will also include inserts or a placard where background information can be inserted or etched regarding background information on the displayed object.<br /><br /><strong>This is a request for information. No funds are available at this time. </strong>

Pursuant to FAA Market Survey posting of March 25, 2011, and responses received thereto, the FAA has determined competition to be adequate for Requesting Offers and making a subsequent award for the Terminal Automation Systems Independent Data Analysis and Solution Development (IDA & SD) effort. This acquisition has been Set Aside for Small Business. Only small businesses, qualifying under NAICS Code 541512 "Computer Systems Design Services" (gross receipts averaging not more than $25 million annually for the past three years) will be eligible for award
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for Independent Data Analysis & Solution Development (IDA & SD) for the FAA Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) and the Common Automated Radar Tracking System (CARTS). These systems collect information from radar and other surveillance sources (including multilateration and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Services (ADS-B)), weather sensors, and flight plan information for each aircraft.  Each system integrates the collected data into graphical and textual presentations used by air traffic controllers to safely and efficiently direct aircraft in Terminal Service Areas. These systems are currently operational nationwide at Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities and Air Traffic Control Towers.  The systems undergo evolutionary and complex software development, often including new and improved functionalities including those for alerts and safety.  The FAA has a continuing need for IDA & SD to ensure that system software evolution continues to allow Air Traffic Controllers to decrease possible accident risks, reduce the number of safety-related incidents, and reduce traffic delays while allowing for inclusion of future software enhancements that meet the challenges of growth and change.

<DESC>This is Modification 1 to the synopsis entitled Engineering Product IntegrationContract (EPIC), NNJ12395182LA, which was posted on 09/21/2011.  The purpose of thismodification is to address questions asked in response to the original synopsis posting. Question 1: Can the government please provide the specific requirements a company mustmeet to qualify as being "located in the geographical area of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas,Oklahoma, and New Mexico"? (For example, does having an existing auxiliary office in oneof these states satisfy the requirement?)Answer 1: Any offeror submitting a proposal for this requirement must have a bona fideplace of business in one of the 5-states and it must be approved by the Small BusinessAdministration (SBA).Question 2: Can the government please provide its rationale for limiting the competitionto companies in Texas and surrounding states? (Such a requirement is, in our experience,unprecedented for a federal contract. Furthermore, it seems contrary to the government'sinterest if it wishes to procure products and services at best value, or lowest cost,etc.)Answer 2: After conducting internal market research and coordinating with our SmallBusiness office and the SBA, it was determined that there are enough firms in the 5-stateregion for the Government to expect and adequate competition.  Therefore the Governmentcould establish fair and reasonable pricing and receive the best value.  The federalprocuring entity designates an offer as either open to SBA 8(a) firms nationwide or mustindicate the limits of the locality.Question 3: What is the time frame that this Source Sought becomes a RFQ?  Answer 3: Further information, including a milestone schedule, will be posted on theacquisition website (http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/epic/  ) at a future date.Question 4: Is this a rebid or a new objective?  Answer 4: This effort combines scope from different contracts supporting the EngineeringDirectorate at NASA Johnson Space Center.  Though the work is being performed underexisting contracts, the anticipated scope of the complete requirements under EPIC wouldbe considered a unique contract.Question 5: If there is an incumbent are they eligible for rebid?  Answer 5: NASA/JSC cannot establish a business eligibility at this time.Question 6: Is there a 8(a) small business contractor currently performing similarduties?  Answer 6: Portions of the existing contracts scopes of work are currently performed bySBA 8(a) certified small businesses.Question 7: Would this SOW be a continuation of the incumbent's objectives?  Answer 7: This is an effort combining scope from different contracts supporting theEngineering Directorate at NASA Johnson Space Center.  Though the work is being performedunder existing contracts, the anticipated scope of the complete requirements under EPICwould be considered a unique contract.Question 8: What personnel are needed for the engagement?Answer 8: This will be addressed in any solicitation resulting from this effort.

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract with a 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

<DESC><p>This notice is for Informational Purposes Only: This is not a solicitation for proposals. <br /><br />Description of Services required: <br /><br />The purpose of this task order is to deploy and implement a program for the support and expansion of the adoption and use of a Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) that can be applied to reduce Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI) in hospitals in all States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico through State-based or regional consortia/collaborative in a phased approach. This task order shall be built upon and expand current activities to demonstrate the effectiveness of CUSP for CAUTI in twelve States. This follow-on effort shall utilize the resources and materials for CUSP for CAUTI that have been developed as part of earlier contract work for this expansion of the national implementation effort. To accomplish this task the awardee must: <br />Recruit hospitals within each of 15 additional States to demonstrate the ability of applying CUSP to CAUTI during the base year, recruit hospitals in another 15 States during option year 1, recruit hospitals in remaining States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in option year 2 and recruit additional hospitals who have not yet participated in all States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico during option year 3.<br /><br />Identification of the exception of to fair opportunity:<br /><br />This order must be issued on a sole-source basis because only one awardee is capable of providing the services required at the level of quality required because the services ordered are unique and highly specialized.</p>
<p>The Hospital Research and Education Trust (HRET), is unique among the ACTION II partners, in two primary ways: HRET is an affiliated organization of the American Hospital Association (AHA) and is structurally related to state hospital associations. Consequently HRET already has established working relationships with all states. HRET is the only ACTION II partner that has an organizational relationship with the AHA and state hospital associations throughout the country and is recognized as a leader in education improvements for hospitals nationally. <br />No other ACTION II contractor has such an established and existing relationship and the capacity to build a statewide collaborative lead by state hospital associations. The second unique aspect of HRET is that they are an organization whose mission and special expertise is the development and dissemination of educational materials directly to state hospital associations and their affiliated hospitals to improve quality and safety. This existing distribution and dissemination structure will facilitate the distribution of the products to hospitals nationwide. Additionally, the existing dissemination mechanism allows the products to be disseminated after the completion of the funding period. No other ACTION II contractor has this built-in capability in their core structure. A third and most compelling reason is that under a existing ACTION I task order contract, HRET is already implementing CUSP for CAUTI in twelve states and has the experience gained in that effort to expand to all states.</p>
