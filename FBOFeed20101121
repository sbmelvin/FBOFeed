<DESC>PURPOSE: This is a Sources Sought announcement to assess the interest and qualifications of HUBZone certified small business firms, in competing for a contract for an anticipated procurement entitled "Roofing" at all U.S. Federal and military installations on Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands. The information provided will be used to determine whether to issue the proposed solicitation as a competitive set-aside or whether to issue as full and open competition (unrestricted). The information provided will not be disclosed out of the agency and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research. <br />PROJECT INFORMATION: This anticipated project is currently slated as a Request for Proposal (RFP) procurement to be conducted per the procedures outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 15 and 36. The anticipated contract will be a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract. The project includes providing experience, personnel and a capability to perform a broad range of maintenance, repair, and minor construction work on various real property facilities. The above general description of work does not in any way limit the responsibility of the Contractor to perform all work, supervision, management, quality control, labor, tools, equipment appliances and material and performance in strict accordance with specification, drawings and subject terms and conditions of each task order and the basic contract. The estimated performance period of the contract will include a one-year base period with the option to extend for four (4) additional one-year option periods. The maximum value of all work will be limited to $50M over the life of the contract. Tasks under the contract are estimated to vary in size from $2,000 to $10,000,000. The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this anticipated procurement is 238160 with a small business size standard of $14,000,000. <br />WHO MAY RESPOND: Interest in this Sources Sought announcement is open to HUBZONE certified small business prime contractors, relative to the primary NAICS code 238160. Following review of the responses to this notice, and if the Government still plans to proceed with an acquisition, the Government will develop an acquisition strategy to determine whether the solicitation for this project will be issued as HUBZone certified small business set aside. <br />Note to Small Businesses: Small businesses may team together (or even affiliate) and be eligible for award of a set-aside contract, provided that each team member meets the small business size standard for the acquisition and are deemed capable. The current Small Business Administrative (SBA) rules allow a set-aside when there is a reasonable expectation of at least two or more competitive offers from small business teams when at least 50% of the effort will be performed by the collective efforts of all small business members of the team. The current SBA 8(a) affiliation rules allow joint ventures or teams when the 8(a) concern performs a "significant amount" of the work with its own employees and the size of at least one 8(a) participant to the joint venture is less than one half the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract. Such teams and/or joint ventures require the prior approval of the SBA. A Service-Disabled Veteran Owned-Small Business (SDVOSB) prime contractor can subcontract part of a SDVOSB contract provided they spend at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel on the concern's employees or on the employees of other SDVOSBs. A joint venture of at least one SDVOSB and one or more other business concerns may submit an offer as a small business for a competitive SDVOSB procurement so long as each concern is small under the NAICS code size standard assigned to the contract. A qualified Historically Underutilized Business (HUBZone) prime contractor can subcontract part of a HUBZone contract provided they spend at least 50% of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel on the concern's employees or on the employees of other qualified HUBZone small business concerns. A joint venture of two or more qualified HUBZone small business concerns may submit an offer for a HUBZone contract so long as each concern is small under the NAICS code size standard assigned to the contract. The joint venture itself need not be certified as a qualified HUBZone. Further information regarding teaming and joint ventures are located in the Code of Federal Regulations (13 CFR 124 and 125). <br />SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Interested parties should submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact below no later than close of business -4:30 p.m. Chamorro Standard Time (GMT+10) on 3 Dec 2010. Oral communications are NOT acceptable in response to this notice. Sources shall include in their information: a detailed capabilities statement detailing their experience within the past three years of same or similar work described in this notice, a point of contact with phone and e-mail information; business status, business size based on NAICS 237310 and a positive interest to submit a proposal. In order to receive an award from any resultant solicitation, should one be issued, the successful offeror must be current/active in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Online Representation and Certification Application (ORCA). The CCR website is: http://www.ccr.gov/. The ORCA website is http://orca.bpn.gov/. Submission of any information in response to this sources sought notice is completely voluntary.
