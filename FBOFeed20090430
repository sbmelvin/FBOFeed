<DESC>The Air Armament Center, 308th Armament Systems Wing, 808th Armament Systems Group, 685th Armament Systems Squadron, Eglin AFB, FL anticipates awarding a sole source Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to General Dynamics – Armament and Technical Products (GDATP), 128 Lakeside Ave., Burlington, Vermont, 05401-4939.   It is anticipated that the total contract period of performance will not exceed three (3) years from time of award and will have an estimated value of $3,000,000.00.

The contractor will conduct integration and testing of the Rheinmetall 25mm x137mm Frangible Armor Piercing (FAP) ammunition in the F-35 GAU-22/A gun system designed and developed by GDATP.  The Government anticipates the effort will be performed in five (5) phases.  Execution of the phases and period of performance for each phase will be negotiated with GDATP at award of the basic contract.  All phases will be awarded on a FFP basis. The 5 phases are as follows: 1)  evaluation of previously fired 25mm FAP ammunition performance and preparation of documentation for USAF qualification testing,  2)  design/manufacture of Mann barrels, 3)  preparation of test plans and evaluation of FAP performance,  4)  FAP ammunition suitability assessment,  5)  25mm ammunition qualification testing.  The contractor will be required to submit a qualification report for suitability of the 25mm round.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The proposed contract action is for work for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible Source”.  The GAU-22/A is different from other 25mm gun systems in the USAF inventory in terms of weight, length, operational requirements and environmental operating parameters.  The highly specialized GAU-22/A gun design and the operational requirements of the F-35 gun system require highly specialized ammunition.  None of the 25mm x 137mm ammunitions in the existing DoD inventory can satisfy these USAF ammunition requirements.  The round selected for the FCT project was designed to the GAU-22/A gun system specifications.  The 685 ARSS believes that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Air Force’s requirements because the 25mm ammunition must pass qualification testing by Aug 2011 and only GDATP can meet this integration schedule.  Therefore, any offerors responding to this notice must provide evidence of capability to perform the above requirements to include the detailed knowledge and capabilities of the GAU-22/A gun system.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  GDATP is the only known source of the technical expertise required to support this requirement.

The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting points of contact identified below. The Ombudsman is Colonel Arnold W. Bunch, AAC/CV, at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB FL 32542-5495; his phone number is 850-882-5422. Collect calls will not be accepted.

For subcontracting opportunities, please contact Shawn Manley at smanley@gdatp.com, 802-657-6026 or General Dynamics - Armament and Technical Products, 128 Lakeside Ave. Burlington, VT 05401-4985

Please forward any written statements of eligibility to 685 ARSS, Attn: Jason Barnes, 207 West D Avenue, Bldg 349, Suite 626, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6864, or facsimile (850) 882-7983 or e-mail Jason.Barnes@eglin.af.mil.

The requirements of the Access Control Point (ACP) policy and physical security for the Department of Army may be found in Army Regulation (AR) 190-13, Army Physical Security Program. Currently there is a security camera system in place at all access control points.  The current system utilizes a computer based DVR system. All components of the current system will need to be replaced, to include the use of a networked based DVR. The security camera systems must meet the current Army ACP Definitive Design requirements. All related computer software used in this project must be approved by the Government as net worthy and the entire system must be accredited by the Government prior to acceptance and start performance. The systems must be compatible with the equipment to be installed as a part of the Automated Installation Entry (AIE) system. When developing the Closed Circuit Television System (CCTV), the Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-022-01, entitled Security Engineering Entry Control Facilities/ Access Control Points (25 May 2005) will be used as a reference design guide. The UFC was issued under the authority of Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 2000.16, entitled Antiterrorism Standards which requires DoD Components to adopt and adhere to common criteria and minimum construction standards to mitigate antiterrorism vulnerabilities and terrorist threats. The minimum standards are based on the assumption that larger amounts of explosives will be detected and denied entry at the controlled perimeter of an installation. It is, therefore, critical that the infrastructure and operating procedures at the Entry Control Facility are capable of that mission. The UFC identifies design features necessary to ensure that infrastructure constructed today will have the flexibility and capability to support future technologies, a changing threat environment and changes in operations. A well designed entry controlled facility can enhance and improve ACP operations. Network connectivity is available at all ACPs.  The systems must also be designed to meet a variety of environmental issues, to include seasonal and weather temperature variations typical of this region of Kansas. <BR><BR>Scope: The Contractor shall provide all labor, supplies, equipment, materials and transportation necessary to replace the existing security camera systems and install new security camera systems at eight (8) access controlled points (ACPs) <BR><BR>The Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-022-01 will be used as a design guide when developing the Closed Circuit Television System. The camera system must meet the current Army Access Control Points Standard Definitive Design requirements. All computer software/hardware applications used in this project must possess a certificate of networthiness (CON) from the US Army and achieve system accreditation for use on the LandWarNet prior to acceptance and start of performance. The system must be compatible with equipment to be installed as a part of the Automated Installation Entry system.  The system must be designed to meet a variety of environmental issues including seasonal temperature and weather variations typical of this region of Kansas. Designs must take into consideration the environmental conditions and the limited space available at the ACP for equipment such as controllers, monitors, and cameras. System shall provide sufficient storage of all the camera recordings for a period of 90 days or more @ 30 FPS, and at 4 CIF (Common Intermediate Format) or better quality using any necessary compression techniques for all cameras. Standard media codecs will be used to allow data to be easily retrieved, exported, and played back utilizing standard computer software (i.e. Windows Media Player).  <BR><BR><BR><BR>In order to submit a possible future bid, all interested parties offering must be currently registered in the Central Contractor Registration web-based system (CCR) under the NAICS code above and be registered, complete and current, in the Online Representations and Certifications Application web-based system (ORCA). <BR><BR>This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment by the government for any purpose. This announcement does not constitute a request for proposal/quote/bid and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. Requests for solicitation will not receive a response. Additional Technical Exhibits will not be made available at this time for review. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice and any follow-up information requests. No basis for claim against the government shall arise as a result from a response to this notice or government use of any information provided. This announcement does not restrict the government to an ultimate acquisition strategy. The government reserves the right to consider acquisition strategies as deemed appropriate.<BR><BR>Industry interested parties that are able to meet the possible requirements are encouraged to submit an electronic letter of interest to this office, address letters of interest/comments electronically to stacey.swader@us.army.mil.  Government desires industry comment relative to the Draft copy of specifications and will also accept any public or industry comments relative to this possible future requirement. Interested businesses responding shall provide the Government, at a minimum, the following information as part of its letter of interest: (1) name of company and applicable CAGE code including a contact persons name, title, telephone number and email address; (2) company address; (3) company size (please specify as either large, woman-owned, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), historically underutilized business zone concern, veteran-owned small business, or service-disabled veteran owned small business; and (4) identify whether it is interested in this acquisition as a prime contractor or subcontractor. <BR><BR>The following information is provided to make interested parties aware of possible US Small Business Administration arrangements that may lead to an increase in small business participation in Government contracts. Note: 1. under certain teaming arrangements, the individual small businesses must meet the size standard instead of using the combined total of employees of all small businesses on the team. Note: 2. to qualify as a small business entity all of the team members must be a small business. One exception is mentor-protege, which does permit large business participation on the team. For more information on teaming arrangements, contact your local US Small Business Administration office, Small Business Development Specialist.<BR>

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an integral part of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) and its mission is to save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce traffic-related health care and other economic costs associated with motor vehicle crashes. To accomplish this, NHTSA collects and analyzes motor vehicle crash data and develops, promotes, and implements educational programs, vehicle safety standards, research, and enforcement programs. 
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 116, “Motor Vehicle Brake Fluids”, sets forth the performance and labeling requirements for hydraulic brake fluids and their containers.  It includes the testing provisions which are necessary to determine if a brake fluid meets the performance requirements for safe motor vehicle use.  FMVSS No. 106, “Brake Hoses”, sets forth the performance and labeling requirements for three different types of brake hoses: hydraulic, air, vacuum and plastic air brake tubing.  

Description: 

The objective of this requirement is to seek the services of an independent laboratory or laboratories to procure automotive equipment for compliance testing and to provide test and inspection services so that the Government can determine if the equipment designed for use on motor vehicles comply with the requirements of FMVSS No. 106 and  FMVSS No. 116.  This requirement will include six (6) tasks: (1) Perform Test Procedures, (2) Test Item/Models, (3) Measurement and Test Equipment, (4) Conduct Deviations from Test Procedures, (5) Storage of Test Items, and (6) Prepare Test Schedule.

<SUBJECT>An Investigation of the Efficacy in Childhood Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder of Riluzole:  An Antiglutamatergic Agent
<SOLNBR>RFQ1043383
<RESPDATE>051409
<CONTACT>Liem T Nguyen, Contracting Officer, Phone 3014358780, Email ln18x@nih.gov
<DESC><p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Support Station/Simplified Acquisitions (SS/SA) Branch on behalf of the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH) seeks to procure on a sole source basis developing and validating services from Frontage Laboratories. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12-Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.5 to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items.
<p>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by the presence of intrusive and unwanted obsessional thoughts and images and of compulsive behaviors. Its presentation during childhood is similar to that seen in adulthood, except that children sometimes lack insight into the senselessness of the thoughts and behaviors. In a recent report on a multi-site study of childhood OCD, Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) alone at one site fared little better than placebo (March et al, 2004). There is a pressing need, then, for the development of alternative, novel treatments for pediatric OCD. Neuropsychological and neuroimaging data suggest that OCD may arise from dysfunction of orbitofronto-striato-thalamocortical circuitry. Glutamate plays a crucial role in the regulation of excitatory activity within this circuit and maybe involved in the etiopathogenesis of OCD. If so, then agents which reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission may provide unique antiobsessional benefits. Riluzole is a medication that reduces glutamatergic activity. It is currently being studied in adults with OCD, and this two-stage study will evaluate the possibility that riluzole will help children with OCD. Riluzole has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and is currently under investigation at NIMH for treatment of depression.</p>
<p>The first stage of this investigation has been completed. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is underway for children and adolescents who have OCD alone or OCD and an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The trial is 12 weeks in duration, and Riluzole is used as a sole agent or as an augmentation to their currently inadequate therapy. Following the double-blind portion of the trial, subjects may receive three months of open-label treatment with Riluzole, if it is clinically indicated. All subjects will be followed at regular intervals until one year from baseline. Riluzole has been used for a single FDA indication (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, an adult degenerative neurologic disorder) for over ten years. It is understood that whether active metabolites of the drug are present and at what level; what levels of drug and any metabolites are available at the sites of action in the brain; whether significant amounts of drug migrate to other compartments in the body; etc.</p>
<p>Previously Frontage Laboratories agreed to develop and validate a methodology for measurement of riluzole levels (no metabolites at the time) in human plasma sent to the contractor from the NIMH stored subject samples, identified to the Laboratory only by number. Frontage Laboratories will also re-assay a proportion of samples in order to satisfy FDA regulations regarding quality controls. The contractor will provide written reports of quality assurance and reports of sample analysis data. The current plan is to analyze samples from the first half of the study, more than 100 samples from 44 patients. Based on the analysis of the data produced, the NIMH may analyze subsequent samples as they become available. The NIMH may also decide to try to measure drug metabolites in available and subsequent samples.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can perform the requirement as detailed the vendor may submit a Statement of Capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NIMH to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NIDA Office of Acquisitions, SS/SA Branch on or before 2:00 PM ET May 14, 2009. All questions must be in writing and can be emailed to Liem T Nguyen at ln18x@nih.gov or faxed to 301-480-1358. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NIDA, vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bph.gov. In addition, vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. No collect call will be accepted. Please reference the RFQ# 1043383 on all correspondence.</p>

Note:  The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, Rhode Island is NOT accepting quotes or proposals via submission through NECO.
The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport intends to award on a sole source basis a Firm Fixed Price type contract to Argon ST, Inc of Newington, VA.  The procurement is to upgrade two ADF antennas (Argon P/N 021591AD-1) into two Patriot Antennas (Argon P/N 022950AD-1).  Argon ST has successfully completed Government testing for Patriot Antennas (P/N 022950AD-1). To award to any other vendor would require incorporating a new antenna assembly into the current data packages, First Article Testing and require the Government to develop an engineering update to the current data package which would create delays and be cost prohibitive.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive ! proposals. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Additional details will be provided upon issue of RFQ N66604-09-Q-3322, which is anticipated to be on or about 05/15/2009.  Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) rating of DO-C9 applies.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:valerie.deangelis@us.army.mil">RDECOM Acquisition Center - Natick</a>
<DESC>The US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA intends to award a contract to a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) to acquire a demonstrative data mart prototype which will incorporate the Requirements Definition document for Data Mart Accessing Veteran Information Digitally (DAVID).  Further information pertaining to DAVID as well as the potential nondisclosure agreement (for third party advisors) will be provided as an attachment to the Request for Proposal. This effort includes the use/access of personnel medical information/records from geographically disparate sources and use of a portal interface.  The demonstration of the prototype does not include interfacing with any DoD computer system or network at this time but the capability to do so subsequently should be an optional attribute of the prototype.  The demonstration will focus on information assurance issues, security, and privacy.   Many medical R&D efforts, both within and external to DoD, have long been confronted with challenges of highly mobile geographical disparate cohorts, selection of key variables targeted for clinical research, and lack of sample sizes necessary for statistical control.  Once demonstrated and documented through this initiative, advances can be adopted by DoD or Federal researchers to create national size samples accompanied with proven analytical tools.  The primary tools to interface with are those that provide disease management and health promotion using electronic means for patients to provide information about their well-being, which are used at about 96 Army and Air Force medical facility sites.  The Government anticipates a single award for a twelve month period of performance.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 541512 with a small business size standard of $25MIL.  This procurement will be 100% Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set-Aside.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) to include a Statement of Objectives; Attachment 0001, DAVID Requirements Definition; Attachment 0002, DAVID Non-Disclosure Agreement and other pertinent documents will be available on the Natick Contracting Division website ON OR ABOUT May 19, 2009 at https://www3.natick.army.mil under Business Opportunities/Current Acquisitions, W58P05-09-R-0032.  Firms will not be reimbursed for any costs associated with proposal quote.  The closing time and date for the RFP responses will be approximately 30 days after release of the Solicitation.  Questions may be submitted to Contract Specialist, Valerie DeAngelis at valerie.deangelis@us.army.mil or by facsimile (508)233-5286.<BR><BR>

<DESC>FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS PLEASE CONTACT KEN SHEDLOCK, (732)532-5549 kenneth.shedlock@us.army.mil<BR><BR>This is a market survey to determine potential sources of supply for a<BR>Canopy Kit, Removable.  <BR><BR>This removable canopy is used to cover/shroud a tactical assemblage that is<BR>housed inside a S-280 Shelter.  The S-280 Shelter is approximately 12'X6'X7'<BR>and is normally transported on a 2 1/2 or 5 ton vehicle.  The removable<BR>canopy provides a sun shield to the exterior roof/sides of the shelter when<BR>military units are deployed in locations of extreme high temperatures. It<BR>keeps the direct rays of the sun from radiating directly on the aluminum<BR>skin Surface of the shelter, thereby allowing the air conditioners to<BR>efficiently maintain the shelter interior temperature at an acceptable range<BR>for soldier operation/performance.  The technical data package for this kit<BR>is specified/described via fully-detailed drawings.  This kit is comprised<BR>of several (corner/side) aluminum bracket assemblies (which can either be<BR>welded together or these components may be casted instead), lanyard<BR>assemblies, rivnuts, screws, washers, sealant, and the 3-piece canopy which<BR>is cloth-laminated, vinyl-nylon high strength material.  One side of each<BR>canopy is a GREEN 383 color, and the reverse side is TAN 686 color, to<BR>allow the canopy to match the camouflauge color scheme of the deployed<BR>environment.  A picture of the kit as installed on a shelter can be provided<BR>via fax/email when requested to the CECOM LCMC POC(below).<BR><BR>This will be a 5 year contract with one option year to satisfy bridging<BR>requirements - Will require that the Item Manager can buy any quantity in<BR>any year up to a max ceiling of 1000ea over the life of the contract.  <BR>Minimum Qty 25ea <BR><BR>CECOM will be reviewing this acquisition to determine if it is suitable for<BR>Full and Open Competition and/or Small Business Set-Aside consideration.

<DESC>This is a special notice to inform the public of the use of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  Please note that this Synopsis provides ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation will be forthcoming.  All questions regarding this SYNOPSIS should be submitted in writing to the following E-Mail address:  Karen.S.Nelson@usace.army.mil.<BR><BR>Point of Contact for this Synopsis and or Solicitation:  <BR>Ms. Karen Nelson.  Email your questions to the US Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District to the attention of Karen.S.Nelson@usace.army.mil <BR><BR>Administering Contracting Office:  <BR>US Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District, ATTN: CESWT-CT, Contracting Division, 819 Taylor Street, Room 2A19, Fort Worth, TX  76102.<BR><BR><BR>This Acquisition shall be competed as SMALL BUSINESS.  This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only.  A Small Business solicitation shall be issued for Design-Build Construction Services.  Services include Design-Build, Design-Bid-Build, and Construction services to meet the requirements for the following customers:  Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area.  <BR><BR>Contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs), with a base period plus four one-year option periods, for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build, and construction services with an estimated total workload value of $400 million for SWF and SWD customers.  <BR><BR>Any work executed under the SWD MATOC is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico).  However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered.  Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area if capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement.  <BR><BR>Scope of work includes, but is not limited to as follows: construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities.  The contracts are not only intended to execute new construction, design-build and design-bid-build, but to provide a timely response to remediation of real and personal property facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection.  <BR><BR>The Fort Worth District intends to award two or more contracts within the Small Business pool, with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $10 million and a minimum task order limitation of $3,000.  The minimum guarantee for the Small Business contract is $3,000 and it only applies to the base period. <BR><BR>In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the PDT will consider  1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement.   <BR><BR>Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).  The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors.  However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the five contractor pools.  All contracts will remain active unless or until 1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) contract expiration; 3) task order completion; 4) the contractual funding limit is reached; or 5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government.  Separate solicitations will be issued for the different contractor pools (Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB). <BR><BR>Any entity may submit proposal(s) who qualifies for the Statement of Work in the Solicitation.   The Awardees will make up the pool for each of the unrestricted and set-aside contract areas (HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business and unrestricted).  There must be two or more awards to create each of the HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted pool.  If there are not enough offerors in any one of the pools to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by- 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be awarded. <BR><BR>The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening.  All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government.  <BR><BR>The basic contract award is anticipated to consider pricing associated with professional labor rates.  These rates will not be subject to the Service Contract Act nor the Davis Bacon Act; General and Administrative rate; and Overhead rates.  After award, competition among the individual pool of contractors for project specific task order requirements is expected to result in fair and reasonable pricing.  However, the contractors pricing will primarily be associated with the quantity of professional labor based on the established contract unit price, competitive subcontractor pricing, and commercial items associated with a specific requirements.  The contractors proposal for a task order will include all the costs for the projectlump sum. There will not be a line item cost for subcontractors or commercial items on the bid schedule.  The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs.  The price proposal shall also (as applicable) include cost for:  All waste and excess material, Mobilization and close out for the total contract and each task order, Clean up, Safety (e.g., safety rails, safety nets, tethers, face/clothing protection, etc.), Traffic and work-site signs and barriers, Project management and supervision, Quality Control (QC), Office management and equipment, Depreciation of mobile office(s), Subcontractor profit, As-Built drawing, submittal, permits, license and other risks of doing business, and Site security. <BR><BR>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542, a Classification Code of Y111, and a business size standard of $33.5 million.  <BR><BR>This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov.

This Synopsis provides ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation will be forthcoming.  All questions regarding this SYNOPSIS should be submitted in writing to the following E-Mail address:  Karen.S.Nelson@usace.army.mil.  <BR><BR>This Acquisition shall be competed as HUBZONE SET ASIDE.  This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only.  A HUBZone Set Aside solicitation shall be issued for Design-Build Construction Services.  Services include Design-Build, Design-Bid-Build, and Construction services to meet the requirements for the following customers:  Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area.  <BR><BR>Contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs), with a base period plus four one-year option periods, for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build, and construction services with an estimated total workload value of $50 million for SWF and SWD customers.  <BR><BR>Any work executed under the SWD MATOC is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico).  However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered.  Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area if capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement.  <BR><BR>Scope of work includes, but is not limited to as follows: construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities.  The contracts are not only intended to execute new construction, design-build and design-bid-build, but to provide a timely response to remediation of real and personal property facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection.  <BR><BR>The Fort Worth District intends to award two or more contracts within the HUBZone Set Aside pool, with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $20 million and a minimum task order limitation of $3,000.  The minimum guarantee for the HUBZone Set Aside contract is $3,000 and it only applies to the base period. <BR><BR>In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the PDT will consider  1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement.   <BR><BR>Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).  The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors.  However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the five contractor pools.  All contracts will remain active unless or until 1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) contract expiration; 3) task order completion; 4) the contractual funding limit is reached; or 5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government.  Separate solicitations will be issued for the different contractor pools (Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB). <BR><BR>Any entity may submit proposal(s) who qualifies for the Statement of Work in the Solicitation.   The Awardees will make up the pool for each of the unrestricted and set-aside contract areas (HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business and unrestricted).  There must be two or more awards to create each of the HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted pool.  If there are not enough offerors in any one of the pools to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by- 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be awarded. <BR><BR>The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening.  All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government.  <BR><BR>The basic contract award is anticipated to consider pricing associated with professional labor rates.  These rates will not be subject to the Service Contract Act nor the Davis Bacon Act; General and Administrative rate; and Overhead rates.  After award, competition among the individual pool of contractors for project specific task order requirements is expected to result in fair and reasonable pricing.  However, the contractors pricing will primarily be associated with the quantity of professional labor based on the established contract unit price, competitive subcontractor pricing, and commercial items associated with a specific requirements.  The contractors proposal for a task order will include all the costs for the projectlump sum. There will not be a line item cost for subcontractors or commercial items on the bid schedule.  The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ANNOUNCEMENT; A MARKET SURVEY FOR INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR QUOTES AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS SYNOPSIS IS TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF POTENTIALLY QUALIFIED SOURCES AND THEIR SIZE CLASSIFICATIONS (SMALL BUSINESS, LARGE BUSINESS, ETC.) PLEASE DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF A SOLICITATION, AS ONE DOES NOT EXIST.
<p>The purpose of this market research (Source Sought Synopsis) is to determine if there are sources that can supply an existing requirement. The Government is seeking, qualified, experienced sources, with information to provide two (2) 3-D interactive computer models, one simulating on-base conditions and one illustrating off-base conditions. In order to maximize teaching effectiveness, Incident Management Course instructors require the development of three-dimensional (3-D) interactive teaching aids to be used in conjunction with script-driven, contractor-created realistic scenarios. To have the intricate descriptive aspects related to the aforementioned &lsquo;conditions' supplied by the government. Develop a multi-scene on-base accident/incident scenario along with one for off-base incorporating motion and video in both. 3-D model dimensions should be scaled to the existing map in accordance with instructors' direction using photogrammetric, traditional measurements and CAD file drawings. Finished scenarios will simulate actual accidents/incidents to the highest degree possible so that students' experiences and responses are genuine. In order to enhance realism, scenarios are to integrate authentic touches such as fog, fire, smoke, recognizable characters, composited images, video, voice-overs, music, sound effects and the like according to government-provided scripts and/or story boards. Commercial-grade off-the-shelf software will be used to provide solid modeling and animation technology that simulates generic on-base and off-base terrain in three dimensions. In addition, the contractor is to work with IMC instructors to develop interactive, script-driven exercise scenarios for use in teaching best practices to accident/incident responders. Some examples of possible scenarios follow:<br />a.) A Chinook (helicopter) crash on an highway close to a military installation. b.) An F-15 (fighter aircraft) crash in an off-base reservoir. c.) A report of animal rights activists on the base runway. d.) A major fire on an AF base. The anticipated period of performance is 1 September 2009 - 31 August 2010 with four (4) option years. A site visit is tentatively scheduled in June 2009.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Government is requesting that interested concerns with background in accident reconstruction and training aid development furnish the following information:</p>
<p>(1) Company name, address, point of contact, voice and fax telephone numbers and e-mail address(s).</p>
<p>(2) Type of business, i.e., small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned, HubZone, serviced-disabled veteran-owned small business, large business, etc.</p>
<p>(3) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code</p>
<p>E-mail responses to this request for information are preferred, and should be sent to: tamika.jackson@maxwell.af.mil. All questions must be submitted in writing and forwarded to the aforementioned point of contact. Mailed responses should be submitted to the attention of SSgt Jackson, 42d Contracting Squadron, 50 LeMay Plaza South, Bldg 804, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6334.</p>

PLEASE DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF A SOLICITATION, AS ONE DOES NOT EXIST.
<p>The purpose of this market research (Source Sought Synopsis) is to determine if there are sources that can supply an existing requirement. The Government is seeking, qualified, experienced sources, for the design, development, delivery, and evaluation of curriculum materials for the revised Junior ROTC course entitled Aerospace Science: The Exploration of Space. The contractor must design a course that is performance-based in that it identifies desired results, determines acceptable evidence of learning, and plans learning experiences to achieve the desired results. The learning experiences must be interactive and learner centered where cadets take an active role in the learning "phases". The learning phases will reveal students' existing knowledge and misconceptions of key concepts; explore, experiment, process, reflect, and apply knowledge; and model or perform the desired behavior based on clear conditions and standards. The course must contain multiple assessments methods to capture cadet progress and learning outcomes (e.g. traditional and performance-based systems). The assessment tasks must serve as tools for verifying and documenting that cadets have mastered the intended learning objectives and outcomes. Assessment tasks will provide feedback to cadets and instructors that guide classroom instruction and improve cadet performance. Questioning strategies (such as reflection) to maximize learning, engagement, and critical thinking must be included. The course must also contain higher level thinking skills and activities designed to engage and broaden the student's minds and tap into their natural curiosity about space enabling them to sharpen their thinking skills. The material shall consist of digital and hard copies of 1) a Student Textbook with electronic version of the textbook (in PDF and MS Office 2003 or later format) bound to the inside back cover of the hard copy textbook, 2) an Instructor Guide (IG) (containing Lesson Plans for all lessons included in the Student Textbook, with accompanying PowerPoint slides embedded into the lesson plans adjacent to suggested script for instructor use and an answer key for the end-of-chapter "Checkpoint" questions found in the text), plus corresponding DVD/CD bound inside the back cover of the hard copy IG containing all IG material cited herein to be included in the IG plus the PowerPoint slide files for each lesson, an Instructor's Test Bank, an answer key file providing answers to the test bank items/questions found on the DVD/CD, instructions and handouts/resource information/presentation slides/etc. for teachers needed to support any interactive in-class or student-centered learning activities called for by the lessons, plus any video files needed for each lesson (files on the DVD/CD will be in Word and PDF formats for the text files, PowerPoint format for the slides [using Microsoft Office Suite programs (MS Office 2003 or later) for all text and PowerPoint files], and any appropriate video file formats). Video files to be used in conjunction with other materials for teaching lessons may be included in a CD/DVD organized such that teachers can easily locate each video file intended for use for a particular lesson or such videos may be embedded into the electronic lesson plan files on the DVD/CD.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Government is requesting that interested concerns furnish the following information:</p>
<p>(1) Company name, address, point of contact, voice and fax telephone numbers and e-mail address.</p>
<p>(2) Type of business, i.e., small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned, HubZone, serviced-disabled veteran-owned small business, large business, etc. under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 511130 which contains a size standard 500 employees.</p>

<DESC>This sources sought synopsis is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities and experience to meet the requirements for the development and production of C/KC/HC/MC-130J MATS devices for the United States Air Force (USAF), United States Marine Corps (USMC) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS).  Contractors/Institutions responding to this synopsis are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards.  The government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey.
The 677 Aeronautical Systems Group (AESG) proposes to procure up to a total of twenty-two Weapon System Trainers (WSTs), sixteen Loadmaster Part Task Trainers (LMPTTs), five Loadmaster Fuselage Trainers (LFTs), five Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs), five Engine Propeller Trainers (EPTs), five Flight Controls Trainers (FCTs), and five Integrated Cockpit Systems Trainers (ICSTs).  These devices are to be used by the Air Mobility Command (AMC), Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) and USMC and will be baselined to their respective aircraft Block configuration to include hardware, software and courseware modifications.  The FMS device configuration baselines are not known at this time but will begin with either the AMC, ACC/AFSOC or USMC baselines.  Additionally, all the devices will be required to maintain concurrency with their respective aircraft configurations by incorporating a block upgrade modification when necessary and a yearly concur! rency/change management option to examine aircraft changes and how they impact the training devices.  The government anticipates a separate contract for the operation and maintenance of these devices.  
The initial contract action may consist of five WSTs, five LMPTTs, two CPTs and two LFTs.  It is anticipated that the delivery of the first WST will be within thirty-two months of contract award.  Four WSTs, four LMPTTs, two CPTs and the two LFTs will be located at a Continental United States (CONUS) operational site while the fifth WST and LMPTT will be located at an Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) site.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), through its National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), will release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the establishment of Regional Test Centers (RTCs) to test small wind turbines to International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) small wind turbine (SWT) test standards, plus any tests in the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) draft standards that are not in the IEC standards. 

Background: Reducing barriers to the expansion of wind energy is an important goal for DOE’s Wind and Hydropower Technologies Program.  One of the barriers for the distributed wind market is the lack of small turbines that are independently tested and certified.  The small wind turbine buying public has long needed a means of distinguishing good, safe wind turbines from products that do not perform as advertised or are hazardous.  The IEC has developed standards for testing and evaluation of small wind turbines.  NREL has developed a testing capability that is accredited by the American Association of Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) and is widely recognized as a competent testing organization.  DOE/NREL proposes to partner with other entities to establish small wind Regional Test Centers (RTCs).  These RTCs will expand small wind turbine testing capability within the United States and allow cost effective testing of small wind turbines to the IEC standard.  These test results can be used to obtain third party certification by the Small Wind Certification Council (SWCC) or other certification body.  It is anticipated that a large number of tested and certified turbines will help grow the industry by increasing consumer acceptance of Small Wind Turbine (SWT) technology.  Other anticipated benefits include: 
- Providing locations where potential buyers can see wind turbines in action
- Provide a focus for workforce and curriculum development efforts at post  secondary institutions
- Broader knowledge within the SWT turbine community about how SWTs work.

Objectives 
1)  To establish Regional Test Centers capable of testing small wind turbines to IEC small wind turbine test standards.
2)  To conduct independent testing, per the IEC small wind test standards, to provide high-quality, independent test results for up to eight small turbines.  It is anticipated that the test results may be used by the turbine manufacturer to apply for certification from a certification body, such as SWCC, for the tested turbine.

The solicitation will target entities capable of conducting high quality testing of small wind turbines.  It will be the responsibility of the RTCs to find one or more small wind turbine manufacturers with turbines to test, with which to partner.  These turbines should be commercially available turbines that have a high probability of success in the US market over the next several years.  

Solicitation Plan 
DOE/NREL plans to release an RFP in summer 2009.  DOE/ NREL anticipates awarding subcontracts to up to four RTCs to test a total of up to eight turbines.  NREL intends to use a firm fixed price type of subcontract.  DOE/NREL currently intends to offer price support of up to $150,000 per subcontract based on testing two wind turbines.  The subcontract value will be independent of the size of the turbine and the installation requirements.  DOE/NREL expects the period of performance to run for 30-36 months.

NREL plans to provide technical assistance to the RTCs based upon DOE funding.  This assistance may include an annual RTC conference, visits by NREL personnel, and providing assistance as needed on an informal basis.  

Planned Scope of Work
The RTC will establish the infrastructure (facilities, staff, & equipment) necessary to test small wind turbines to the IEC standard.  The RTC will coordinate with the manufacturer for installation of the turbine systems at its site, evaluate the turbines through testing and other observations over a test period of up to 18 months (need to meet duration standard of 2500 hours of operation), and report its findings on a publically available web site.   DOE/NREL expects the wind turbine manufacturer to provide a complete turbine system to the RTC, provide documentation, and assist with installation and maintenance.  

Planned Requirements
Proposed RTCs must have, or be able to procure, the facilities, staff, and equipment required to conduct testing to IEC standards and be able to raise at least the minimum price participation (20%).

Turbines to be tested must meet the following criteria
a. Manufacturer’s ability to manufacture and supply turbines for the U.S. market, and provide the associated installation & maintenance support. 
b. Generate electricity for use on a 60 Hz AC grid or for a 12, 24, 36, or 48v battery system.  Mechanical turbines and direct connect (variable voltage) generator/motor configurations will not be accepted;
c. Rotor swept area less than or equal to 200 m2;
d. New, not refurbished;
e. Meet National Electric Code (NEC) electrical safety requirements such as circuit protection and anti-islanding provisions; 
f. Available for shipment and installation at the RTC.

Planned Selection Criteria
a. Business plan to ensure the RTC can remain in business after DOE/NREL funding is no longer available.
b. Past experience with small wind turbines and testing
c. Experience & knowledge of proposed staff
d. Suitability of the proposed facilities & equipment for wind turbine testing
e. Price participation
f. Plan to release test results to the public

DOE/NREL will also consider RTC diversity, turbine configuration diversity and geographic diversity. 
 
Note
The RFP will require the RTC to provide information about proposed staffing, facilities and equipment, past experience with small wind turbines and testing, and business plan sustainability.  For each turbine the RTC proposes to test the RFP will require information such as: power curve; selling cost; turbine features; maintenance requirements; warranty; UL rating of the inverter and other components; sales history, especially in the last year; number of turbines currently installed; tower options; number of dealers/installers; manufacturing volume capacity; and, the capabilities to support the product for the life of the turbine system.  

Expressions of Interest 
The purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to obtain an indication of the level of interest by industry participants, both potential RTCs and small wind turbine manufacturers in the project described in the Solicitation Plan and to develop a Bidders List.  Failure to respond to this notice will not disqualify anyone from participation in the solicitation, but those that do respond to this notice are assured of receiving the RFP & notification of related activities, and of being listed in the RFP if so desired.  

Expressions of interest should not include detailed proposals, but should include the following information: the names, addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers and email addresses of the primary contact person; a statement indicating whether or not the respondent wishes to receive a copy of the RFP, a statement indicating whether the participant wishes to be listed in the RFP, and (optionally) comments on the proposed Regional Test Center project.  Potential RTCs may provide a brief background of their small wind and testing experience. Small wind turbine manufacturers may provide a brief description of the turbine (a brochure may be provided); NREL proposes to list interested potential RTCs and manufacturers in the RFP to make it easier for potential participants to find partners. Responses to this notice should not exceed – 5 pages; a product brochure may be attached to the response.  Responses should be received at NREL by 29 May 2009.  This is not a request for proposals.  Please send responses (by mail, facsimile or email) to

<DESC><p>Request for Information
<p>Subject to final approval, The Bureau of the Public Debt, Administrative Resource Center, Division of Procurement, intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, to Bloomberg Financial L.P., 731 Lexington Ave., New York, NY 10022 for the renewal of Bloomberg Online Financial Subscription Service, for a base and four option years. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.<br />The Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) is currently utilizing the Bloomberg Online Financial Subscription Service, and is in need of the renewal of this service for 2009 in order to ensure continued performance. A sole source is intended for this order; no other source is known that is fully capable and available to provide the required services.</p>
<p>Bloomberg Online Financial Subscription Service is used by Treasury Auction participants, U.S. Treasury policymakers, and debt managers to access historical and prevailing data on U.S. Treasury securities such as real-time pricing, issue information, and WI rates. The data provided by Bloomberg is proprietary data.

<DESC><p>United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Central Region Acquisition Division, (CRAD) is soliciting sources for the equipment and necessary technical support for the deployment of two buoys in the southeastern United States during November 2009 - March 2010 for the Passive Acoustic Monitoring of North Atlantic Right Whales in the Southeastern United States. This includes the refurbishment of two existing auto-buoy packages, deployment of two continually recording buoys ("Pop-Ups") at the same locations, and monitoring of the auto-detection buoys while they are deployed in waters off Jacksonville, FL and Brunswick, GA.
<p>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 is responsible for the management of marine mammal population. The agency is mandated to conserve the endangered species under its jurisdiction and must undertake actions to prevent further decline of populations, facilitate their recovery and safeguard the quality of their habitat. The population of right whales in the western North Atlantic is highly endangered. NOAA Fisheries is proposing to continue a program to utilize autonomous passive monitoring devices to gather data on the presence of right whales in the southeast United States. The objectives of this project are as follows: The main objectives of this project are:</p>
<p>1) To deploy two passive acoustic auto-detection buoys near Jacksonville, FL and Brunswick, GA to collect data on calving right whale vocalizations during the 2009/2010 winter calving season.</p>
<p>2) Simultaneously deploy autonomous recording buoys at the same locations to provide a continuous record of right whale sounds.</p>
<p>3) The buoys will be deployed during a six-month period beginning in November 2009.</p>
<p>4) The auto-detection systems will provide near real-time notification of right whale detections delivering data to land stations at least every four hours, and preferably at a higher reporting rate.</p>
<p>The units should have the following capabilities:</p>
<p>1) Ability to record sounds in the frequency of right whale contact calls to digital media for underwater deployments of at least 6 months. <br /><br />2) Buoyant housings that can withstand water pressures at depths greater than 100 feet and sufficiently rugged to survive the high wave energy experienced on the Southeast Atlantic continental shelf during winter months.</p>
<p>3) On-board systems to automatically identify right whale acoustic calls and notify land-based stations through cellular or satellite phone communication</p>
<p>4) Equipment to communicate with land-based systems for display and monitoring of right whale contacts</p>
<p>Historically, the equipment has been available from only one known source, Cornell University. Cornell and their subcontractor, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) has been successful in developing buoys. WHOI produces the buoys and Cornell designs, manufactures and implements an electronic instrumentation package; detection recognition software, communications hardware/software and web based detection, classification and notification systems. The Government does not have specifications for the buoys or the electronic instrumentation package. Interested firms shall provide, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; detailed descriptive literature of the products that it has provided previously for the same or similar effort, and a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications to supply the required passive acoustic monitoring units and a system to archive and disseminate collected data which will be considered by the agency. Responses can be faxed to Charlene Yaple @ 816-274-6977 or sent via email to Charlene.A.Yaple@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>Central Region Acquisition Division, requires that all Contractors doing business with this officer be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made to a company not registered in CCR. For additional information to register in CCR, please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov. In order to register, all firms must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505. Contractors should submit their Certification and Representations thru the on-line Business Partner Network (BPN). The BPN is the single source for vendor data for the federal government. Contractors are encouraged to go on-line at www.bpn.gov to complete its representations and certifications.</p>
<p>Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any questions should be directed to Charlene Yaple, Contract Specialist, at 816-426-7531.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT FOR THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS (USMC) COMMON AIRCREW TRAINER (MCAT) PROCUREMENT PROGRAM (MCATPP). The Department of the Navy, Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando, FL, is seeking potential sources with the ability to produce training solutions to satisfy USMC Enlisted Aircrew Training requirements, to include the Marine Common Aircrew Trainer (MCAT). The primary effort includes implementing a systems approach to training to analyze requirements, produce, deliver, and install approximately 12 MCATs to USMC MCAT locations.  The requirement also will include a brief support period following delivery at each MCAT location.  The MCAT is intended to be a single training system that provides training to enlisted aircrew (EAC) on the MV-22, CH-46E, CH-53E, and UH-1Y aircraft. Stand-alone KC-130J enlisted aircrew training solutions may be procured under this effort, if they cannot be delivered as part of the MCAT.

The MCAT system will be used primarily to train the USMC EAC in skills essential for performing “wheels up” tasks during various flight missions including, but not limited to, Assault Support, Combat Operations, and Transport missions.  Specific training tasks will include, but not be limited to, aerial gunnery, scanning, hoist operations, external lift operations, and standard and emergency flight procedures, while emphasizing entire crew coordination – to include communication and training with all aircrew, via interoperation with aircrew simulators.

Through the use of the appropriate Training Manuals and the Government-supplied Enlisted Aircrew Training Task Comparison (EACTTC) Report, the MCAT shall provide training scenarios appropriate for EAC to learn and become proficient with the specified tasks.  The MCAT shall allow EAC to use their own gear during training, to include flight helmets, harnesses, communication equipment, and night vision devices.  The MCAT shall provide simulated and actual interactions with pilot/copilot flight trainers and other MCATs to allow for both independent training and participation in distributed mission operations.    

The MCAT solution is intended to provide a common, multi-platform, approach to training to maximize hardware, software, and space economies, but may also include small quantities of back-end, fuselage, externals, or gunnery station trainers. The MCAT system shall be compatible with existing and future USMC common software baselines to the maximum extent possible.  The MCAT will be required to be delivered with appropriate Information Assurance (IA) controls, and a certified “Authority to Operate” (ATO) accreditation.  Additional requirements will include hardware and software documentation, engineering drawings, initial provisioning of spares to support a 95% readiness rate, initial operator and maintainer instructional training, and integrated logistics support and documentation for eventual independent operation and maintenance.

Written responses to this announcement should specifically address the following:
 
1) A submission of your firm’s detailed capabilities to meet the requirements listed in the paragraphs above.

2) Your firm’s specific experience with: 
a) Implementation of enlisted and/or non-aircrew training solutions to meet multiple aircraft platform training requirements in a single training solution,
b) Production and delivery of training solutions to address enlisted and/or non-rated aircrew training,

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT:  This is a sources sought notice to identify potential small businesses certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Act of 1997, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business Program (SDVOB), or Small Business.  The Social Security Administration has a requirement with a period of performance of one base year and four option years.  The Government expects to make an award in September 2009.  This acquisition is expected to be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) after review of the responses from this announcement.  The government seeks industry input to determine if this acquisition should be set aside for 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOB, or Small Business under the auspices of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code number for this requirement is 541990 with a size standard of $7.0 million.  The services are described below.

PURPOSES:  Section 1149 of the Social Security Act, as added by section 121 of the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, requires that the Commissioner of Social Security establish a community-based work incentives planning and assistance program to provide accurate information to disability beneficiaries about work incentives programs and issues related to such programs.  As part of its continuing response to this requirement, the Social Security Administration (SSA) plans to award State based (56) cooperative agreements for Work Incentives Planning and Assistance (WIPA) projects.  The cooperative agreements will be effective April 1, 2010 and may be renewed annually through March 31, 2015.    

The WIPA projects provide work incentives planning, assistance, and outreach services in all States, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories to adults, transition-age youth and members of Native American communities who receive benefits based on disability SSA and who wish to work.  The goal of the WIPA program is to assist such beneficiaries in their efforts to work, primarily by removing one of the major barriers to work: uncertainty and fear about the immediate and long-term effects of work on net income and healthcare coverage.   

The WIPA projects use Community Work Incentives Coordinators (CWICs) to enable disability beneficiaries to make fully informed decisions about work by providing them with accurate, understandable information about work incentives, related issues, and programs designed to facilitate joining the workforce, such as the Ticket to Work and Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) programs.  The CWICs also may assist disability beneficiaries in their efforts to use these programs, such as by assisting in the development of a PASS.  

The CWICs are encouraged to collaborate with local Department of Labor (DOL) One-Stop Career Centers, as well as with other community partners that provide employment related services to SSA disability beneficiaries. In conjunction with SSA’s Program Manager for Recruitment and Outreach (PMRO) contractor, they provide ongoing outreach to beneficiaries (and their families) and determine who may be eligible to participate in Federal, State, or local work incentive programs.  

The purpose of this contract will be to secure the training and technical assistance that the CWICs will need to be effective and successful in their efforts to support beneficiaries.  A single entity will be contracted for that purpose.  Training provided to the CWICs also may be attended by the staff of other SSA demonstration projects, or community partners, as SSA determines the need.  These additional individuals may increase the number of trainings as outlined in the solicitation.

PROJECT BACKGROUND:  Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs contain a number of policies that are designed to encourage, facilitate and reward the efforts of disability beneficiaries to work.  These programs, collectively called work incentives, assist beneficiaries who are going to work to transition into the workforce without immediate loss of essential income or health-care supports.     Unfortunately, the number and complexity of these policies and programs, together with the complexity of other income and employment supports provided outside SSA’s programs are difficult for beneficiaries and their families to understand.   Many of these work incentives are underused.  Also, uncertainty and fear about the immediate and long-term effects of work, especially on net income and healthcare coverage, often needlessly discourage beneficiaries from working or increasing their earnings.  The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act was signed into law by President Clinton in 1999.  This legislation created a number of initiatives designed to support work, including the requirement that SSA fund community services to provide specialized information and support around Social Security work incentives for beneficiaries who were interested in returning to work.

The Benefits Planning, Assistance and Outreach (BPAO) program was established in 2000 to help overcome this barrier to work by ensuring that beneficiaries had the information they needed to make informed choices.  The program’s 113 cooperative agreements, along with 3 contracts to provide training and technical assistance to the BPAO projects, expired at the end of September 2006.  Funding was reauthorized through FY 2009 by the Social Security Protection Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-203).    

Beginning in October 2006, SSA awarded cooperative agreements for the WIPA projects.  Although WIPA serves a similar role to the previously offered BPAO services, WIPA services are more intensive, longer-term services with an enhanced focus on work.  

Since the beginning of WIPA, 104 cooperative agreements have been issued, providing services throughout the United States and the U. S. territories.  In an effort to improve consistency in technical assistance services throughout the county, SSA awarded one contract to provide training, individual provider certification and technical assistance to all 104 entities funded under WIPA cooperative agreements. 

SSA intends to continue to provide these valuable services throughout the United States.  SSA intends to offer 56 cooperative agreements, one to each state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U. S. territories. As part of SSA’s initiative to provide support and assistance and; to enhance knowledge and facilitate the work of the WIPA network of service providers, SSA will award one technical assistance and training contract to offer a diverse array of training opportunities as well as technical assistance, certification and recertification for direct service providers and CWICs. 

RESPONSIBILITY OF CONTRACTOR:  The technical assistance and training contractor shall provide consistent and accurate training and technical assistance to CWICs and shall develop and maintain training and technical assistance materials for that purpose.  The contractor shall also provide training and technical assistance to members of Native American communities who receive benefits based on disability SSA and who wish to work.  The contractor shall include SSA demonstration project staff and other community partners in the training classes as needed in consultation with SSA. The contractor may also offer special training classes for groups of community partners that will require adapted materials, ongoing supplemental training, technical assistance and certification as deemed necessary and in consultation with SSA.

<DESC>1.1 Introduction

The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) in collaboration with the Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office Technical Support Working Group (CTTSO TSWG) issues this Request for Information (RFI) regarding standoff optical techniques for the detection of trace quantities of explosives on vehicles. The request is a focused market survey of any technology that meets the standoff requirement and detects total explosive amounts in the sub-microgram range.  Proponents of technologies of varying Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) from concept formulation (defined as TRL 2) to deployable systems (defined as TRL 9) are invited to submit descriptions of their systems and concept applications.

1.2 Background:

In the manufacture and transport of Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIED), there are trace amounts of the explosive deposited on the outer surfaces of the vehicle. This could be due to human handling of the IED with subsequent transfer to the surface, a contaminated area used for IED manufacture, or the IED shedding trace amounts as it is being loaded into the vehicle. Developing standoff techniques would mitigate the ominous hazard imposed on personnel involved in contact trace sampling.  This Concept of Operation (CONOP) is the topic of explosive trace detection research in a number of government and private sector laboratories.

A successfully deployed non-contact system will detect sub-microgram amounts of explosives spread across defined surface areas (several hundred square centimeters) at substantial standoff (>20 meters) within seconds, while incurring a very low false alarm rate, and will be robust enough to perform in a variety of weather conditions.  Successful technologies will be eye-safe.  Identifying the type of explosive threat is also desirable for many CONOPS but not mandatory.  These requirements present a daunting technical challenge that spans scientific disciplines and requires creative approaches using novel techniques.


1.3 Objective:

Submissions to this RFI will be used to assess the state of the art for the standoff trace detection of VBIEDs using optical techniques.  Additionally, the RFI will identify technologies that may be applied to standoff detection with further development.

It is anticipated that some responses will describe systems that are at a TRL greater than 5.  A TRL 5 system is defined: “The basic technological components are integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so it can be tested in a simulated environment”. Examples include “high fidelity” laboratory integration of components and software.  Systems that are eye-safe and do not damage surfaces as they are interrogated are preferred.  Systems that can scan hundreds of square centimeters for explosive particles are also desirable.  Submissions may also describe systems below a TRL of 5.  Technologies that fall under this category may include ones that are currently being developed for other CONOPS or may be entirely novel approaches. 
 
1.4 RFI Submission Requirements:

To respond to this RFI please provide no more than a ten-page white paper describing the system. Please provide one original hard copy and a CD containing an electronic copy. White papers must be in Microsoft Word Format. Responses of more than 10 pages will not be reviewed. Please explicitly include the following (as appropriate) in the response:

• Discussion of technology and measurement technique,
• Laser wavelength and power,
• Laser safety requirements,
• Operational range of system,
• Response information provided by system,
• Minimum and maximum trace levels detectable for each explosive,
• Scan area,
• Scan time,
• Response time,
• Diagram and picture of system,
• Power requirements,
• Site requirements, if any,
• Date of availability,
• Maturity of system (Technical Readiness Level)
• Independent Reports (include as an addendum, not included in 10 page limit),
• Listing of past, current, and projected government funding for your organization as it pertains to the work being described,

• Responses should include name, telephone number, and an E-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to discuss responses with the government representatives.

1.5 General Guidelines

• White papers should be no more than ten (10) pages in length including any and all appendices and attachments.

• Submissions must be received no later than 5:00 PM, U.S. Eastern Standard Time, June 12, 2009.

• Any company proprietary information, performance capabilities and/or future modification plans should be clearly identified and marked.

• Companies are solely responsible for any and all expenses incurred pursuant to responding to this RFI.

• This RFI is issued solely for purposes of conducting market research and does not constitute any current or future commitment by the Government.

• Unsolicited proposals in response to this RFI will not be considered.

• A one page cover letter that provides a brief summary of the response and indicating if supporting documentation is included.

• The white paper must address all areas of information requested by this RFI.

<DESC>A MARKEY SURVEY is being conducted to determine if there are adequate Small Business, HUBZone, 8(a), or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business contractors for the following proposed project: Construct an Armed Forces Reserve Center (AFRC). Primary facilities include land acquisition, an AFRC training building, unheated storage building, and organizational parking. Buildings will be of permanent construction with HVAC systems, plumbing, mechanical systems, security systems, and electrical systems. Supporting facilities include land clearing, paving, fencing, general site improvements, and extension of utilities to serve project. Accessibility for the disabled will be provided. Force protection (physical security) measures will be incorporated into design including maximum standoff distance from roads, parking areas, and vehicle unloading areas.

This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the Walla Walla District, US Army Corps of Engineers, USACE, to identify contractors that can provide a Manta (Brand Name) Model MTS-5000 Protective Relay Test System, or approved equal, for Ice Harbor Lock and Dam.  However, this Sources Sought Synopsis will, in part, assist the USACE in determining set-aside potential.<BR><BR>Description:<BR><BR>Technical Specifications<BR>Generator, Transformer and Motor <BR>Protective Relay Test Equipment<BR>Manta (Brand Name) Model MTS-5000, or Approved Equal<BR>Ice Harbor Lock and Dam<BR>Burbank, Washington<BR><BR>1.0	INTENT<BR>1.1	The following specifications pertain to the purchase of a protective relay test set to support maintenance and testing of Ice Harbor Lock and Dam protective relays.  This maintenance and testing supports the requirements of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation NERC and Western Electricity Coordinating Council  WECC.<BR>2.0	TERMINOLOGY<BR>2.1	Protective Relay:  Either an electromechanical or digital device which interprets electrical current and voltages of protected equipment.  The Protective Relay compares these voltages and currents to reference forces or levels.  If measured voltage or current levels are outside acceptable range the Protective Relay causes action to prevent damage to the protected equipment.<BR>2.2	Electromechanical Protective Relay: An electrical device that converts electromagnetic energy into mechanical force.  This mechanical force acts against mechanical springs and magnetic force to cause a desired effect (usually contact closure) to cause protective action at a set point.<BR>2.3	Digital Protective Relay: (Also called a Multi-Function Protective Relay), an electronic device which samples electrical values.  The device compares the sampled values to a set of references.  If limits are exceeded the device causes a protective action.<BR>2.4	Protective Relay Test Set:  Test equipment that performs functional testing of electromechanical, digital protective relays.  The test equipment provides calibrated voltages and currents to simulate inputs to Protective Relays under test.  To support testing, a test set has timers to measure protective relay response.  A test set displays the calibrated inputs and device under test response for evaluation. <BR>2.5	Arbitrary Adjustment: Independently adjustable test quantities of voltage, current, phase and frequency.  <BR>2.6	Multi-Phase Adjustment: The ability to adjust one or more of the output test signals with a common adjustment.<BR>2.7	Parameter Display: A visual display of output test signals.<BR>2.8	Steady State: A condition where values remain constant.<BR>2.9	State Sequencing: A programmable test system that changes output to different discrete steps as determined by a test sequence.  The sequence may be controlled using time or event triggers such as contact closure. <BR>2.10	Sequence of Event Recorder: An electronic device capable of recording rapid system state changes. The recorder stores and can then display a chronological record. The record aids in determining if the sequence of a test was correct.<BR>2.11	Waveform Playback:  The ability to display previously recorded events or tests.  Usually the playback uses internally or externally stored data in an industry standard format.<BR>2.12	COMTRADE (Common Format for Transient Data Exchange): An IEEE standard file format for high-speed oscillographic data on multiple data channels.  This format allows capture of detailed waveform data for power system events.<BR>2.13	IRIG-B (Inter-range instrumentation group time codes):  This standard describes the format for synchronizing time signals from the Global Positioning System (GPS)<BR>2.14	UTC: Coordinated Universal Time is a time standard based on the International Atomic Time.<BR>3.0	BACKGROUND<BR>3.1	Ice Harbor Lock and Dam is in the process of replacing an obsolete and non-functional protective relay test set.  This test equipment is required to provide functional testing of all protective relays at Ice Harbor Dam.  <BR>3.2	During 2007 Ice Harbor Lock and Dam replaced the Main Unit and Transformer protective relays.  The new protective relays require three (3) arbitrarily controlled phase inputs.  The obsolete test equipment cannot provide these three (3) test currents and voltages the new protective relays require.    <BR>3.3	The obsolete protective relay test set requires a MS-DOS based computer to provide data retention and display.  Current computers and data retention methods are not capable of interfacing to the obsolete test device.  The data format the old equipment supports does not meet the current industry standard format.<BR>4.0	GENERAL<BR>4.1	This section covers the purchase of a protective relay test set and related cables to support functional testing of new Main Unit and Transformer Protective Relays.  Additionally this equipment will support functional testing of protective relays located throughout Ice Harbor Lock and Dam.  Specified equipment must be delivered within eight (8) weeks of contract award.  <BR>4.2	General Requirements: Capability Requirements for the Protective Relay Test Set.<BR>4.2.1	The protective relay test system shall provide capabilities for functional testing of both electromechanical and digital, generation, transmission and distribution relays in a single compact unit.  It will be operated manually via a front panel interface without any add on or auxiliary control units.  Optionally, the test set can be operated automatically via computer communication interfaces and automatic test software.<BR>4.2.2	The test system shall be capable of testing all types of over-current, impedance, directional, over/under-voltage, frequency, differential, <BR>	out-of-step, phase comparison, auxiliary and motor protection relays as 	well as voltage or current negative or zero sequence networks.<BR>4.2.3	Arbitrary Adjustment: All output amplitudes and phase angles shall be independently adjustable and capable of being simultaneously displayed on the front panel display interface.  All output amplitudes, phase angles and frequencies can be set off-line, without live voltages appearing on the output terminals.<BR>4.2.4	Multi-Phase Adjustment: The AC output amplitudes, phase angles and frequencies shall be capable of being controlled in a multi-phase fashion to simulate load conditions and phase-to-phase and 3-phase faults in power systems.  The amplitude and phase angle of multiple outputs shall be adjustable by numeric keypad entry or continuous dial adjustment of a single parameter only.  Once fault quantities are entered once they can be rotated to the next phase (ie. A-G to B-G to C-G for phase to ground faults, and A-B to B-C to C-A for phase-phase faults) without re-entry of the values.<BR>4.2.5	Parameter Display: All parameters shall be displayable on the front panel display as numeric values.  AC amplitudes and phase angles shall be displayable on a live phasor graph on the front panel display.  The display shall remain active when the system is under automatic computer control.  <BR>4.2.6	Steady State Output: The test system shall be capable of applying output quantities as per the specifications in a steady condition indefinitely for testing metering, protection stability, and relay steady state pickup levels.<BR>4.2.7	State Sequencing: The test system shall be capable of being programmed to change its output settings in different discrete states in a pre-determined sequence or dynamic sequence depending on device under test response.  Each state can have an optional pre-set duration.  At least 6 independent states shall be provided.  The transition between the first and second output states can be set to occur at either a specific point-on-wave (0-359 degrees) or synchronized with an external digital trigger signal.<BR>4.2.7.1	Power system model software shall be optionally available to create realistic dynamic state tests including DC offset current waveforms.<BR>4.2.8	Sequence Of Events Recording: The test system shall be capable of recording the sequence of events on all contact/voltage input channels during a test.  The sequence of events recording shall be presented on the test systems front panel display.  The recording resolution shall be 0.1ms minimum.  The sequence of events recording can be optionally stored to the test systems internal non-volatile memory or removable memory drive.  Sequence of events presented in a numerical and graphical format with the ability of measuring differential times between events.<BR>4.2.9	Waveform Playback: The test system shall be capable of playback of analog and digital signals from IEEE COMTRADE format files for transient testing and re-production of recorded disturbances from digital fault recorders or protective relays.  COMTRADE files shall be accepted directly by the test system, and any necessary channel assignment, scaling and sample rate conversion can be performed from the front panel user interface.  <BR>4.2.9.1	The AC channels shall have a minimum -3dB bandwidth of 0-3kHz for the reproduction of transient waveforms.  The system shall be capable of a minimum of 1 minute of continuous playback on all AC and contact output channels.<BR>4.2.9.2	The test system shall be capable of storing multiple sets of test waveforms in its internal non-volatile memory or removable memory drive.<BR>4.2.10	Time Measurement: At least 4 timers shall be provided to allow measurement of protection operate times or other times.  The timers shall be programmable to start or stop on a given input transition or output state transition. <BR>4.2.10.1	Range: 0-99999 seconds or 0-99999 cycles<BR>4.2.10.2	Significant digits: 	6 <BR>4.2.10.3	Accuracy:	Greater of 0.2 ms or 1 LSD<BR>4.2.10.4	Resolution: 0.1 ms for times less than 1 second, 1ms otherwise<BR>4.2.11	Time/Phase/Frequency Synchronization: The outputs shall be capable of being time, phase and frequency synchronized to an internal GPS clock or external IRIG-B signal to allow synchronism with the relays under test and to facilitate end-to-end testing.  The transition between the first and second output states can be synchronized to one-minute UTC boundaries.  Sequence of events recording shall be referenced to the IRIG-B time when GPS or IRIG-B time synchronization is employed.<BR>4.2.11.1	For testing of synchronizing devices and simulating power system islanding conditions, each AC output can be set to be frequency locked to one of two internal frequency sources.

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard (USCG) awarded a competitive Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract in 2002 to Integrated Coast Guard System (ICGS), a joint venture between then Northrop Grumman Ship Systems (now Northrop Grumman Ship Building (NGSB) and Lockheed Martine Corporation, to serve as the Deepwater Systems Integrator for recapitalization of USCG assets.  Three (3) National Security Cutters (NSCs) and the Long Lead Time Material (LLTM) for the fourth ship were procured under the subject IDIQ contract.  

The USCG intends to award a sole source, Fixed Price Incentive Fee contract in accordance with FAR Part  15 to NGSB for the fourth (4th) NSC (with optional support CLINs, such as spare shipboard spares and outfitting); the option for the Long Lead Time Material (LLTM) and the Production and Delivery of the fifth (5th) NSC (with optional support CLINs, such as shipboard spares and outfitting); and the option for LLTM for the sixth (6th) ship.   The follow on ships are to be of the same dimensions, configuration and operational capability as the first three (3) NSCs.  The NSC(s) are to be delivered within 38 months at the point of origin.  The proposed contract is to be for a period of five (5) years and to be awarded on or about March 2010.  The intended sole source award to NGSB, 1000 Access Road, Pascagoula, MS 39567, NAISC Code: 336611 – Naval Shipbuilding, Classification Code 3731, Naval Shipbuilding, is under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(2)(iii)(A) and (B), based on the substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, as well as an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency’s requirements.  Award to any other source would result in a negative operational impact to the USCG.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will not be released through GPE.  Should any interested party request a copy of the solicitation, please contact the Contracting Officer and Contract Specialist.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD (USCG) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER (RDC) IN NEW LONDON, CT.  This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the USCG's needs with regard to the planned execution of a Research, Design, and Development Support Services contract.  It is anticipated that this effort will result in the award of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a performance period of five years.  In a rough order of magnitude, it is anticipated that the effort required over the five-year period may be in the range of $25M.

The RDC is the Coast Guard’s (CG) sole facility performing research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) in support of CG major missions of Maritime Law Enforcement, Maritime Safety, Marine Environmental Protection and National Security. RDC’s efforts are broad and varied. The RDC also supports CG acquisition and regulatory processes for the purpose of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of CG operations and resources.

The RDC is seeking information on companies that have the capability to augment the capacity and technological expertise of the RDC in the broad areas of Research, Design, and Development.  This augmentation will result in a long-term partnership that will allow the RDC to evolve their role as technical advisor and consultant to their sponsors which include CG,  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and other Government agencies.

The primary contractor support services required are in the following functional areas:
      1.	Systems Engineering Design and Development
      2.	Operational Test and Evaluation
      3.	Naval Architecture/Marine Engineering
      4.	Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and 	Reconnaissance (C4ISR)
      5.	Wide Area Surveillance
      6.	Port Security/Infrastructure Protection
      7.	Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives (CBRNE) 	Detection and Protection
      8.	Marine Fire Safety Research Services
      9.	USCG Traditional Missions to include Search and Rescue, Maritime Law 	Enforcement, Oil Spill/Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Response, Aquatic 	Nuisance Species (ANS) Mitigation, Waterways Management, and Alternative 	Energy
     10.	Logistics
     11.	Workforce and Staffing Analysis
     12.	Human Systems Integration (HSI)
     13.	Operational Research and Decision Support
     14.	Concept of Operations (CONOPS) Development
     15.	Risk Analysis and Management
     16.	Requirements, Alternatives, Cost, and Operations Analysis

In almost all cases, each task order will require an integration of expertise from a wide variety of these functional areas. The level of support required varies by each task order.

Work under this contract may provide the Contractor with access to advance information about future Government procurements that is not generally available to other persons or firms.  In addition, the work may involve the definition of requirements, or the preparation of specifications, for various systems, equipment, hardware, and/or software. In order to prevent a potential bias, unfair competitive advantage, or potential conflicts of interest, the Contractor shall be subject to restrictions for the duration of each task order and for one year after completion and acceptance of all work performed thereunder.

RDC efforts broadly address the Research, Design, and Development of CG systems including prototypes, testing and evaluation of Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) systems, and improving existing CG’s operational and maintenance systems.  Many projects address issues of critical importance requiring an appreciation of local, national, and international maritime polices and regulations; a perspective of socio-economic concerns as they apply to the CG and DHS; and an in-depth understanding of maritime needs and technological opportunities.  RDC activities occur on three separate time horizons. Some activities focus on improving the capability of today’s CG. Other activities define the capabilities for tomorrow’s CG (5-10 years). RDC also explores CG capabilities needed 15-25 years in the future. 

Capability statements in response to this market research shall include the following:(1) a description of the capabilities and infrastructure components that demonstrate the ability to support multiple functional areas integrated within each task order [limit 3 pages]; (2) a description of company history with regard to (a) how multidisciplinary experience was obtained or developed  and (b) types and/or combination of types of awarded contract vehicles (e.g. Cost Reimbursement, IDIQ, Fixed Price, Fixed Price Level of Effort, Time & Materials, etc.) [limit 1 page]; (3) a description of the degree of teaming needed to meet the requirements listed above including the need to accommodate the possible surge in level of effort [limit 1 page]; (4) A description of the company’s Quality Control Program that will be used to insure quality products are delivered in a timely manner [limit 1 page]; and (5) identify whether you are a small or large business with regard to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541330.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRSVAMC IOWA CITY, IOWA #636A8JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONJUSTIFICATIONIn accordance with the requirements of FAR 5.202.A-2, FAR 6.302-2, and FAR 6.302-5, I submit the following justifications:1.	The action being approved is Emergency purchase of request #636-09-3-4110-0125, at the Iowa City VAMC.  2.	The Medical Center needs to purchase Antibody screening materials for patients awaiting transplant surgery.  Due to the extremely High volume of patient testing a shortage of tissue typing supplies has occurred.  Specific calibrations are set on the instruments used for this particular testing and the method developed by One Lambda is the method chosen by the HLA lab.  The estimated total value of the purchase is $77,560.00. 3.	The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-2 -- Unusual and Compelling Urgency, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2) and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2). 4.	Iowa City VA Medical Center needs the Screening materials to perform DNA typing on transplant patients.  Molecular typing is required to match patients to donor.5.	Based on the urgency and nature of the requirement FAR 5.202(a)(2) and FAR 5.202(a)(4) apply and a solicitation will not be issued.   6.	It is determined based on the information provided that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.7.	Due to the urgency, there is currently no time for this requirement to be fully and openly competed.  Delay in the award of a contract for the Purchase of the screening materials would result in delay patient care/harm to patient and possible financial damage to the Government.   8.	There are no sources that have expressed an interest in the acquisition.9.	Withstanding the emergent nature of the requirement, full and open competition would still not be warranted due to the calibration and lab set up for One Lambda supplies/product line. APPROVALBased on the foregoing findings, I hereby determine, within the meaning of FAR 6.302-1 and in accordance with VAAR 806.304 and the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 that:a.	It is in the best interest of this medical center to acquire the products from One Lambda.Upon the basis of these justifications, I hereby authorize the sole source negotiation for this procurement and by signing this document certify that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of my, the contracting officers knowledge and belief.//signed//							03-23-09	TODD YAHNKE                     					DATEContracting Officer

<DESC>The 2009 Missile Defense Agency Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Industry Day will be held in Long Beach, CA on August 11-12, 2009. Industry Day will focus on enhancing the SBIR and STTR process for MDA and the Small Business Community.

Small Businesses will have the opportunity to sign up for one-on-one sessions with key MDA technical representatives and prime DoD contractors.  This will be a great opportunity during the DoD pre-solicitation period (July 27, 2009 through August 23, 2009) to ask technical questions about specific solicitation topics. All sessions are unclassified and questions should be limited to topic requirements. Offerors may not ask for advice or guidance on solution approach, nor submit additional material to the topic author.

For reasons of competitive fairness, direct communication between potential bidders and topic authors will not be allowed after August 24th - the last day of the SBIR and STTR pre-solicitation period. 

Research Area Leads will give briefings on the following technology areas of interest to MDA during the Phase I SBIR and STTR solicitation period: 
                o	Interceptor Technology
                o	Manufacturing, Producibility & Field Sustainability
                o	Radar Technology
                o	Space Technology
                o	Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC)
                o	Directed Energy
                o	Modeling & Simulation
                o	Innovative Concepts & Special Focus Projects*

*SBIR only; both the SBIR and STTR solicitations cover all seven other areas.

Conference Objective:  By establishing this event, it is the goal for the MDA SBIR PMO to allow small businesses the opportunity to schedule one-on-one appointments with technical representatives where they can learn as much as they can about the technical aspects of the SBIR/STTR Program and the upcoming solicitations topics and research areas. A better informed small business community is more likely to submit stronger, more focused proposals and minimize duplication and mistakes - enhancing the SBIR/STTR process for MDA and the Small Business Community.

Who Should Attend?  
                o	Small businesses in any industry looking to respond to MDA's SBIR or STTR solicitations and provide innovative technologies to the missile defense community; 
                o	Medium to large sized companies interested in establishing working relationships with small businesses with innovative technologies and approaches; 
                o	Government advanced technology program managers.

<DESC><p>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Mammal Laboratory located in Seattle, WA on a sole source basis with Marine Research, Ltd. The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed contract is for research and review of Southern Humpback Whales for National Marine Fisheries Service. The objective of this contract is to compile all relevant information on humpback whales in the Southern Hemisphere for inclusion in the status review. The overall goal of the status review, of which this work is a part, is to assess the biological status of humpback whales globally. NMFS leadership will ultimately use this review to consider possible division of the global humpback population into DPSs, and based on the biological status of those DPSs, make recommendations for identifying the listing status of each specific DPS of humpback whales as consistent with the intent of the ESA. The Contractor shall review and synthesize all existing information on Southern Hemisphere humpback whales, derived primarily from the IWC's ongoing Comprehensive Assessment of these populations. The Contractor shall work closely with NMFS scientists in the preparation of the review document. The contractors will then meet with appropriate NMFS staff to discuss issues such as potential DPS divisions, threats to each DPS, and status revisions. This face-to-face meeting would occur sometime in fall or early winter 2009. This assessment and its results require complex demographic modeling skills and a thorough understanding of whaling catch history. Contractors will be responsible for compiling their analyses into a report and delivering it to NMFS in late winter 2009. Dr. Jennifer Jackson of Marine Research Ltd has extensive involvement with the International Whaling committee process, she is a key component of the Comprehensive Assessment of Southern Humpback Whales including the modeling. The government intends to negotiate a firm- fixed price contract with a period of performance&nbsp;that will start May 18th, 2009 and ends Dec&nbsp;31, 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed attention to Maria Mendoza at (206)527-7513or email at maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov.

By pre-competing and awarding to the most capable, experienced contractors, the ESI team will save DoD components time, expense and acquisition risk associated with conducting their own new competitions.
The scope of the ESI systems integration vehicles will include COTS software implementations utilizing traditional and service oriented architectures (SOA).  Contracts will be structured in accordance with a proven, phase-based implementation methodology.  To incorporate best practices in pricing, ESI has aligned its efforts with the Joint Information Technology Team (JITT_ to define standardized scope parameters for an implementation project for bidders to price.  ESI has also partnered with the Business Transformation Agency (BTA) to align its practices with DoD ERP programs, which requested the contract types to be expanded to include cost-type contracts in addition to Fixed Price and Time & Materials contracts.  Therefore, GSA schedules will not be used for this upcoming competition.

<DESC>Advance Notice For the<BR>Unmanned Aircraft System Control Segment Architecture Industry Days<BR><BR>1. This is a special notice to industry inviting attendance to the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Control Segment (UCS) Architecture Industry Days to discuss control segment architecture approaches for implementation in all Department of Defense (DoD) Group 2-5 UAS.  The government seeks involvement of industry in defining this modular open systems architecture and may conduct future working group meetings to continue industry involvement in the definition process.  The UCS Architecture Industry Days is the initial meeting of this process.  The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this invitation nor to pay for participation.  Written or email inputs or unsolicited proposals will not be accepted.<BR><BR>2. The US Army Project Manager for UAS is leading a tri-service UAS Control Segment Working Group (UCS-WG) chartered by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OSD AT&L).  This working group is chartered to define a common, open, and scalable control segment architecture supporting all Group 2-5 DoD UAS.  The control segment is any station or embedded software fully or partially controlling an unmanned aircraft vehicle or payload.   UAS Groups 2-5 include all UAS above 20 pounds maximum gross takeoff weight.  This architecture is intended to enable the warfighter to add capability, offer competitive options, encourage innovation and increase cost control.<BR><BR>3. The intent of the government is to define a standardized, government-owned, controlled, and managed modular open systems architecture applicable across Group 2-5 DoD UAS.  This architecture may be implemented, in whole or in part, in Services individual projects according to specific requirements and objectives, but the UCS-WG is not involved with any specific implementation of this architecture.  The charter of the UCS-WG is only to define a modular open systems architecture, in terms of documenting modules and interfaces to the degree necessary to achieve the business case objectives for cooperative development, competitive acquisition, and rapid integration.  The UCS-WG is not chartered to develop a Joint Ground Control Station (GCS); it is not chartered to develop common hardware or software; it is also not chartered to develop joint human-machine graphical user interface software.  Specific implementations of the defined architecture in a GCS or other Control Segment in accordance with individual unique project requirements will be the responsibility of individual Service projects and are beyond the scope of the UCS-WG charter.<BR><BR>4. In order to begin the process of defining a draft architecture coordinated between the Services and in harmony with the Services varied concepts of operation and architectural requirements, the UCS-WG formed an Architecture Team.  This team first met in March 2009 and outlined top-level objectives that a successful architecture must meet.  These objectives include (a) modular open systems architecture with defined interfaces; (b) support for airworthiness, security, and safety; (c) no specific computer operating system and no common operating environment; (d) hardware independent; (e) geographical separation of modules via networking; (f) scalable from full scale launch and recovery capability to limited payload receipt function; (g) support interoperability requirements; (h) extensible to support mission-specific functionality; and (i) support rapid integration of new aircraft, sensors, weapons, technology and applications.<BR><BR>5. This special notice seeks to identify interested parties who wish to participate in the definition of the UCS architecture.  All participation must be unclassified and nonproprietary and must not assert intellectual property rights nor contain export-controlled information.  The UCS-WG and its consultative body includes, or may include, individuals from varied industry, academic, and government organizations including foreign nationals from friendly or allied nations.  Any or all participants may be present during any of the discussions or meetings, so participants should plan to conduct discussions accordingly.  Any information provided in discussion may be further discussed with any of the participants; this is an open forum.  However, it is the responsibility of each Company to ensure that appropriate export licenses or Technical Assistance Agreements (TAAs) are in place prior to exporting U.S. technical data to a foreign national during these discussions.  Details related to ongoing or possible future acquisition activities or plans within DoD or any of the Services will not be discussed.<BR><BR>6. To further facilitate communications and input from interested parties, UCS Architecture Industry Days will be held 27-28 May 2009 in Huntsville, AL.  The government will present an overview of the UCS Architecture objectives and working group activities and plans to industry at large.  Industry is then invited to participate in a series of working group sub-teams to address specific elements and challenges facing the working group.  Interested parties wishing to participate in Industry Days should register on or before 20 May 2009 at http://www.uascswgaid.eventbrite.com/.  This website also has details regarding location of the meeting and schedule.  Each attendee must register individually.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)</p>

For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-</p>
<p>(1) ( )In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) (The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.)</p>
<p>( ) (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror ( ) does ( ) does not certify that--</p>

<p>(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and</p>
<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)</p>

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared inaccordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additionalinformation included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the onlysolicitation, which is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ); quotes are beingrequested and a written solicitation will not be issued.This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to fabricate a stainlesssteel adsorption compressor vessel assembly which has been designed by NASA Ames.Although the assembly is described as a compressor, it should be noted that it is not atraditional compressor. The final product, when filled with sorbent, will accept gas atlow pressure (&lt; 1 atm) and deliver gas a higher pressure (&gt; 1-2 atm). Compressionis achieved because the sorbent attracts gas while it is cooled, and releases gas athigher temperature.Please provide us with a cost for each assembly. Up to 3 assemblies may be procured. TheGovernment reserves the right to award to more than one vendor based on technicalspecifications and price.SCOPE:Two compressor vessel assembly units function as a swing-bed CO2 scrubber and compressor.Air containing CO2 (human exhalation) is pushed through one units inner cylindrical bedduring a cooled half-cycle (time interval). In the next half-cycle, the CO2 captured onthe inner, cooled sorbent is heated and released, pressurizing the gas	to ~1 psia, andcaptured on the opposite-side compressor outer sorbent bed. In the subsequent half-cycle,that same CO2 is heated, pressurized to ~20 psia and delivered to a downstream processor.In this way the CO2 is removed from the air stream and pressurized in two stages. Twocompressors operate out of phase to provide continuous scrubbing and continuouspressurization.  REQUIREMENTS: The units will be evaluated as a major component of the Low Power CO2 Removal (LPCOR)project, an atmosphere revitalization system to scrub CO2 from the space cabinatmosphere. During use, the compressor volumes contain heaters, instrumentation andsorbent (pelletized material), and will be alternately heated to ~300C and cooled tonear-room temperature. The integrity of seals is critical to the performance of the unit.Fabrication processes that involve distortions should be controlled so as to achievefinal dimensions and tolerancing.Characteristics:The assembly includes two thin-walled cylindrical, concentric volumes, and two end capsto provide gas inlet and outlet ports and electrical feed-throughs. The wall thickness ofeach thin-walled cylinder is about .025 so as to minimize heated mass (diameters are9.7 and 10.9 and length is 11). Each end cap includes a hermetically-sealed vacuumspace to limit heat transfer, and is a welded assembly of irregularly-shaped components.Feed-throughs penetrate the weldment. During operation, the cylindrical spaces will be used to contain sorbent and heaters, andmust be sealed from one another and from the exterior environment under thermally-drivenpressure loads. An externally actuated valve plug also includes a circumferential seal,used to periodically stop flow to the compressor. To maintain sealing under allconditions, three seal grooves must be concentric and round to 0.001 inch (largestdiameter is 10.9 inches). The dimensions of the overall assembly (end caps andcylindrical cans) are roughly 11 inches (diameter) and 20 inches long. See associated pdfassembly and detail drawings.  (339-0901-M003)Place of Performance: Fabrication (machining) will be performed at the bidders facilities and the facilitiesof their associates. Critical dimensions must be checked and certified by the offeror. In particular, see the drawing notes (339-0901-M004; 339-0901-M005; 339-0901-M006) ontolerancing of the valve plug and valve seat. The valve assemblies when installed in thecover assemblies must travel .75 from the closed position to the open position withminimal resistance. The valves may be mated to individual cap assemblies and need not beinterchangeable. The valves and caps shall have reference marks to indicate the properorientation of the parts with respect to each other. Seals will be provided to theofferor and a dry fit check, vacuum integrity check, and functional check of the valveoperation must be successful.  Offeror will provide NASA a written test procedure forapproval before performing tests. The units will be delivered to NASA Ames. Ames willperform additional dimensional checks and functionality checks after receipt. The Government intends to acquire the items using FAR Part 13.Questions regarding this acquisition must be submitted in writing (e-mail is preferred)to Brandon Nguyen, Brandon.p.nguyen@nasa.gov, fax number 650-604-2593 no later than 4:00p.m. PST on May 11th, 2009.  Telephone questions will not be accepted..  (Prospectivequoters shall notify this office of their intent to submit a quotation). It is thequoter's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of amendments.  Potentialquoters will be responsible for downloading their own copy of this notice, the on-lineRFQ and amendments . An ombudsman has been appointed - See NASA Specific Note "B".Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs link below.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

BASIS FOR BAND NAME REQUIREMENT:

New critical mission requirements demand information stored on microfiche and microfilm.  Cleveland Military Pay Operations and Civilian Pay Operations have a need for five microfiche readers/printers due to the increasing requirement to respond to requests requiring pay information located only on microfiche. This information must have the ability to be researched and mailed.  There are several microfiche readers on the market but only the ScanPro 2000 possess the proprietary features with pending patents required to meet the new mission requirements.  The ScanPro 2000 also replaces the discontinued ScanPro 400 and older ScanPro 1000 readers.  Required features include: e-mail option- this is a must in decreasing mailing and printing costs and adding the flexibility of having multiple technicians working on the same claim at the same time and providing immediate electronic correspondence and discussion between said technicians- will speed up service time for the customer (e-mail option also allows the technician to save the file to a hard drive and later burn to a CD; which will ultimately lead to reductions in microfiche retains in the future); minimum size required to house the equipment satisfying spacing requirements; will automatically scan 16/35mm and 3-M type cartridge roll film while unattended- which is a feature not available in comparable products.  This will reduce the amount of time the technician has to wait at the scanner, enabling them to accomplish other work.  Additional features provided solely to ScanPro 2000 units included: one view screen with one Software Program for making all adjustments to the microfilm image which increases process time; magnification range with single zoom lenses 7x  to 54x; automatic freeze frame and image enhancement which reduce complexity; customized toolbar for single “click” save, restore, recall settings; remote internet access; and single “click” advances to the next image with automatic framing designed to reduce complexity and make the unit easy-to-use.  The multiple functions of the equipment will eliminate the purchase of additional equipment.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(ii) The Offeror has (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>) has not (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. </span></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. </span></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-bookmark: start_text;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(A) The tax liability is finally determined.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</span></span></span></p>

Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></span></span></p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></span></span></p>

The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor’s date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term “working day” excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.

<CONTACT>David H. Johnson, Email davidhjohnson@fs.fed.us
<DESC>Scope of Contract
The work shall consist of what is shown on the drawings, stated in the specifications and
summarized below:
1.Dick Creek Fences: This work shall consist of furnishing and installing three strand,
smooth wire, high-tension electric fence, braces, gates and one cattle guard. Fence
construction is divided into three separate sections of approximately; 8,826 ft, 7,900
ft. and 6,300 ft. Also to include the removal and relocation of one cattle guard.
2. Carter Mountain Fences: The exclosure is a 3 strand barbed wire fence with a top
rail. Posts and top rail are treated, >8” in diameter and are generally sound enough to
be reused for this project. Any materials that need to be replaced will be provided by
the contractor.
The work to be done involves reconstructing in place the west half of the north fence
line (see attached map). This part of the exclosure was built in a wet area and has
gradually sunk into the ground. It cannot be moved as it was constructed on the Forest
Service property boundary, and moving it to dry ground would place it on private
land. Posts will be installed at ground level to prevent the fence from sinking in the
future.
The second aspect of the project is removing most of the northeast and east sides of
the exclosure and reconstructing it on the west side of the road (see attached map).
The first gate (in the northeast corner of the exclosure) will be removed. The second
gate (in the southeast corner of the exclosure) will be retained along with enough
fencing to tie into natural barriers preventing motorized vehicles from driving around
the gate. This will be marked on the ground prior to initiation of contract work.
Continuous Fence: Approximately 500’ of continuous fencing will be installed at the
end of Forest Road 474.1V to prevent motorized vehicles from going beyond the
road’s end (see attached map). Continuous fencing panels, wood posts, and hardware
will be provided by the government and will be delivered on site. All other materials
will be supplied by the contractor.
3. Brown Mountain Campground (Alternate Bid Item): This work shall include the
removal and disposal of 490 feet of wood fence and the installation of 490 feet of two
rail steel pipe fence and posts.

<DESC>Reference number W912TF-09-T-0005 is issued as a Request For Quotation (RFQ).  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Performance Based Statement of Work, listed below, is for the design and build of a SharePoint 2007 based Intranet portal, New Hampshire Knowledge Online (NHKO) for the New Hampshire National Guard (NHNG).<BR><BR>PROJECT GOALS<BR><BR>1. Allow access to NHKO for part-time Army Guardsmen and NH Air National Guard personnel not in the NHNG Active Directory, through a single sign-on solution with Army Knowledge Online (AKO).<BR>2. Design site portals around unit and staff requirements while fully exploiting the capabilities of SharePoint.<BR>3. Train super users to effectively manage content.<BR><BR>BACKGROUND<BR><BR>The NH National Guards current Intranet is built upon SharePoint 2003.  Much of this site was conceived and built in an ad-hoc manner and content management has not been effective organization-wide.  In some cases, files no longer necessary or relevant still exist on the site.  Therefore, a straight migration from our existing platform to a SharePoint 2007 platform is not desired.  However, existing content and design should prove useful in building the SharePoint 2007 site.  It is our intent for both platforms to coexist, until such time as this project is completed.  A portal listing for the current Intranet is provided in Attachment 1.  During the transition to SharePoint 2007, super users will need to determine which files need to be retained on NHKO, which files need to be archived, and which files can be deleted.  A significant amount of shared files are also stored on network storage named Usdp-04, and the same super user evaluation of these files needs to occur.  Though it is not our intent to migrate all up-to-date/relevant files stored on Usdp-04 to NHKO, links to these files should exist on NHKO.  A listing of shared folders on Usdp-04 is provided in Attachment 2.<BR><BR>The NHNG is composed of three elements, the Joint Forces Headquarters, the NH Army National Guard, and the NH Air National Guard.  The NH Air National Guard maintains its own Intranet at Pease Air National Guard Base.  The NHNG employs approximately 960 Air Force personnel, 1815 Army personnel, and 20 civilians.  Furthermore, about 140 state employees support facilities operation and maintenance.  While most NHNG employees are part-time, over 700 are full-time military and civilian employees.  We work and train in sixteen communities around the State.  An organizational diagram for the NHNG and NH Army National Guard (NHARNG) are provided in Attachment 3.<BR><BR>NHARNG personnel will set up the NHKO web server and database server.  The operating system for the former is Windows Server 2003R2 Enterprise 64-bit. The legacy intranet (NHKO) server is built on a VMWare virtualized Windows Server 2003 Enterprise (32-bit) machine with Intel Xeon x5355 @ 2.66GHz x4 processors, 2GB RAM and 220GB storage.  The new NHKO system will be built using physical (non-virtual) Dell PowerEdge rack-mounted servers (yet to be acquired) with the web server using Windows Server 2003R2 (64-bit) and the database server using Windows Server 2003R2 (64-bit) & SQL Server 2005 (64bit).<BR><BR>NHARNG personnel will also setup the single sign-on solution with AKO.  MOSS will be configured to utilize Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) to provide authentication and authorization data instead of Active Directory credentials.  SiteMinder, a Computer Associates product, uses an ADFS plug-in to allow SiteMinder to act as an authentication mechanism for Microsoft SharePoint portals.  This integration requires an ADFS server and installation of the ADFS claims-aware agent on a MOSS 2007 server.  SharePoint instances using this service must be running against an ADFS-aware version of Active Directory.  Diagrams depicting the authorization sequence are provided in Attachment 4.<BR><BR>At the time of this writing, most client workstations/laptops are using the Microsoft XP operating system with Office 2003 installed.  However, migration to Microsoft Vista and Office 2007 has already begun, and should be completed shortly after completion of this contract.<BR><BR>DELIVERABLES<BR>1. Conduct an on-site kick-off meeting to review the existing SharePoint site, discuss a roadmap for completion of this project, and identify enterprise-level requirements.<BR><BR>2. Meet with the site owners and identify business requirements for the Adjutant General, Adjutant Generals Special Staff, Adjutant Generals Personal Staff, Joint Staff, Army Staff, 197th Fires Brigade (with subordinate elements), 54th Troop Command (with subordinate elements), the Recruiting and Retention Command, Medical Command, and 195th Regiment (see Attachment 3).  Sites will include portals for internal personnel and external customers if required.  Note: The NH Air National Guard operates a separate Intranet, and is not participating in this project.<BR><BR>3. Document enterprise, individual site, and My Site requirements and recommend taxonomy.<BR><BR>4. Determine, design, and build pages to include:<BR>"	Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)<BR>"	Navigation options<BR>"	Branding<BR>"	Color schemes<BR>"	Identify site columns needed<BR>"	Identify web parts and content<BR>"	Identify lists and library requirements<BR>"	Identify customizations, if any<BR>"	Document site requirements<BR>"	Identify other web part requirements.  Out-of-the-box web parts are included in this agreement; custom web parts are not.<BR><BR>5. Develop a content migration plan to move existing content from current file systems/folders and the SharePoint 2003 Intranet.  Actual migration will be executed by NHNG personnel.<BR><BR>6. Coordinate/recommend MOSS configuration settings with Directorate of Information Management (DOIM) personnel.<BR><BR>7. Configure and build search functionality:<BR>"	Define content stores to crawl (file shares, Exchange public folders, etc.)<BR>"	Define search scopes - by staff/command site, by content source, etc.<BR><BR>8. Test sites.<BR><BR>9. Execute SharePoint super user training to include:<BR>"	Creating, viewing, and editing document libraries in SharePoint 2007<BR>"	Document management features<BR>"	Overview and management of default lists and list templates<BR>"	Using Default and Custom Views<BR>"	Managing site access permissions<BR>"	Working with indexing and searching<BR>"	Performing site maintenance<BR>"	Managing site usage<BR>At least one super user for each distinct site on NHKO will be trained.  The NHNG will provide the classroom and the equipment.  Class size is not to exceed 18 personnel per class.<BR><BR>Deliverables will be the sole property of the NHNG to use as it sees fit without restriction.<BR><BR>QUALIFICATIONS<BR><BR>The NHNG will only consider vendors who are Microsoft Gold Partners and who can demonstrate strong expertise in Windows SharePoint Services (WSS) and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS).  The NHNG will not consider any proposals from vendors that cannot provide evidence of direct, relevant experience with these technologies.  Vendor submitting quote must perform under this contract and shall not subcontract performance.<BR><BR>PROPOSAL FORMAT & SUBMISSION<BR><BR>Offerors are to submit an original and either five hard copies or one digital copy (MS Word or PDF) of the following information:<BR><BR>1. Title Page.  Include agency's name, address, telephone number, principal contact, fax number, and email address.<BR><BR>2. Cover Letter.

Resumes (citing any certifications) of individuals on the offerors staff who will be involved in the project.<BR><BR>4. Project Schedule and Milestones<BR>     a. Detail a work plan in narrative, outline, and/or graphical form describing the offerors approach to designing, managing, and coordinating this project.  Include the proposed staffing, deployment and organization of personnel to be assigned to this project.<BR>     b. Proposed timeline for plan completion, to include meeting times, interim reports/progress reviews.<BR>     c. Describe the process used to track projects and explain how the offeror will communicate status reports to NHNG staff.<BR><BR>5. Total project cost.<BR><BR>PROPOSAL EVALUATION:  The provisions at 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items apply.<BR><BR>Evaluation of responses will be based on the following criteria.  Ability to perform and past performance, when combined are weighed greater than price.<BR><BR>1. Price. The Government evaluation team will conduct a Price evaluation of each offeror's price proposal to determine whether or not each proposal complies with the stated criteria: 'Reasonableness' and 'Realism'.  Reasonableness of an offeror's proposal is evaluated through cost or price analysis techniques as described in FAR Subpart 15.305(a) (1) and (4).  For cost (Price) to be reasonable, it must represent a cost (Price) that provides best value to the Government when consideration is given to prices in the market, (market conditions may be evidenced by other competitive proposals ),  and the technical and functional capabilities of the offeror.  Realism is evaluated by assessing the compatibility of proposed costs with proposal scope and effort.  For cost (Price) to be realistic, it must reflect what it would cost the offeror to perform the effort if the offeror operates with reasonable economy and efficiency.  Proposals unrealistically high or low in price, when compared to the government estimate, and market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion<BR><BR>Go Rating: The proposed price is determined to be reasonable and realistic.<BR><BR>No Go Rating: The proposed price is determined to be unreasonable and/or unrealistic.<BR><BR>2. Ability to perform.<BR>     a. Professional qualifications necessary for successfully performing the work required as stated in this SOW.  <BR>     b. The staffing, backgrounds and experience of the specific individuals to be assigned to this project.<BR>     c. Project schedule and milestones submitted for completion of work.<BR><BR>Top Rating: The offeror has extensive experience and track record in full-cycle implementation and integration of MS SharePoint solutions.  The offeror has executed similar projects for other DoD or federal agencies, or agencies of similar size.  The offeror has other industry awards/certifications pertinent to this project in addition to the Microsoft Gold Partner requirement.  Staffing to be dedicated for the project is deemed sufficient to execute the terms of this SOW.  Staffing possess advanced knowledge of business workflows and has an in-depth understanding of the capabilities of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007, Windows SharePoint Services 3.0, and SharePoint Designer 2007.  Designated staff has at least three to six years of working experience on SharePoint applications.  Staff members possess Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist (MCTS) for SharePoint Server 2007 and Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 credentials.  Staff members possess Microsoft Certified Master: SharePoint Server 2007 or Microsoft Certified Application Professional (MCAP) credentials.  Staff posses experience with Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Visual Basic, Microsoft C#, .NET framework, and asp.net.  Staff has experience in developing custom web parts and integrating enterprise content with SharePoint.  The offerors submittal demonstrates a thorough understanding of the requirements and has salient features that offer significant advantage to the Government.  Adequate time has been allocated to research requirements and solicit feedback from NHNG business units.<BR><BR>Acceptable Rating:  The proposal exceeds the standards of 'Poor Rating' defined below, but does not fully meet the criteria defined above for 'Top Rating'.<BR><BR>Poor Rating:  The offeror has not been able to document significant experience implementing SharePoint from design through development, deployment, testing, and training.  The offeror has not been able to document any significant experience working on projects of similar scope, or for DoD, federal, or other government agencies.  Neither the offeror nor designated staff has certifications that would indicate industry-accepted recognition of qualification to perform the work designated in this SOW.  Proposed staffing/manpower are deemed inadequate to execute the terms of this SOW.  The submittal does not indicate an understanding of project requirements.  The submittal does not demonstrate a sound approach to project management, and in particular, does not adequately address requirements analysis or feedback from business units.  The proposal mimics the SOW language rather than expressing offerors approach or understanding of the RFP.<BR><BR>3. Past Performance.<BR>     a. References.<BR>     b. Evaluation of submitted SharePoint portfolios.<BR><BR>Top Rating: References indicate past performance met contract requirements and exceeded many to the Government's benefit.  Problems, if any, were negligible and were resolved in a timely and highly effective manner.  Performance was generally current and relevant to this project.  References indicate an excellent probability of success with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the government's requirements.  Submitted portfolios indicate excellent:<BR>"	Use of collaboration tools<BR>"	Use of alerts/notifications<BR>"	Integration with MS Office applications<BR>"	User interface and navigation<BR>"	Approach to enterprise content management<BR>"	Visual appeal<BR><BR>Acceptable Rating: References indicate past performance met most contract requirements.  Quality was good to adequate.  Minor problems may have been identified however; the contractor took satisfactory corrective action to resolve them where appropriate.  There is a fair to good probability of success with an average degree of risk in meeting the government's requirements.  Submitted portfolios exceed the standards of 'Poor Rating' defined below, but do not fully meet the criteria defined above for 'Top Rating'.<BR><BR>Poor Rating:  References indicate past performance did not meet some contractual requirements.  There were problems, some of a somewhat serious to serious nature.  The contractor's corrective action was sometimes marginally effective to ineffective.  The probability of success is questionable with an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the governments requirements.  Submitted portfolios are overly simplistic, do not leverage SharePoints capabilities, and exhibit solutions that are little more than an extension of shared drives with a web-based front end.  Site features do not appear to facilitate efficient collaboration with team members, finding organizational resources, location of corporate information, or management of content and workflow.  There is no evidence of customization to meet specific customer needs.  Submitted sites are unnecessarily complex or difficult to navigate.  Submitted portfolios are visually unappealing.<BR><BR>CONTRACT AWARD<BR>Contract award will be made without discussion.<BR><BR>The provisions and clauses listed below are applicable to this solicitation.<BR><BR>FAR 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration, FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-3 Alt I Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (Dev), FAR 52.219-28 Post Award Small Business Program Representation, FAR 52.222-3 Convict Labor, FAR 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, FAR 52.222-42 Statement of Equivalent Rates for Federal Hires; FAR 52.222-51 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain EquipmentRequirements;  FAR 52.223-15 Energy Efficiency in Energy-Consuming Products; FAR 52.225-13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases, FAR 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration, FAR 52.233-3 Protest After Award, FAR 52.233-4 Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim, FAR 52.237-1 Site Visit; FAR 52.237-2 Protection of Government Buildings, Equipment, And Vegetation; FAR 52.247-34 F.o.b.

The Mission's program is organized under three significant objectives plus supporting activities that are cross-cutting in nature. USAID programs focus on: (1) Accelerating economic growth through policy reform, workforce development, energy policy and competitiveness in technology and agri-business; (2) Promoting good governance through local government decentralization, judicial reform and strengthening civil society; and (3) Providing quality education via projects in primary education and teacher training. 

Macedonia is one of the poorest and smallest of the former republics of Yugoslavia. With a population of two million, the country is landlocked and only seven years removed from a civil war. Whereas stability and security have improved dramatically from 2001, USAID programs are still crucial to Macedonia's successful transition to a market-based democracy with social equity. United States Government (USG) goals in Macedonia include: bolstering Macedonia’s prospects for North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and European Union (EU) membership, strengthening judicial and democratic systems and promoting economic growth.  
10.2	POSITION DESCRIPTION

a. Duties and Responsibilities of the Position

Based in Skopje, the PSC Democracy and Local Governance Office Director (DLG-OD) will be responsible for development, management, monitoring and evaluation of a broad range of democracy and governance (DG)-related programs undertaken by USAID in the Republic of Macedonia. 

Macedonia’s Euro-Atlantic integration has stalled. In April 2008 Greece blocked Macedonia’s NATO invitation pending resolution of the name dispute. Although the United Nation’s mediator has worked diligently to develop the outlines of a compromise, there is no resolution in sight. The EU annual report on Macedonia again recommended against setting a start date for accession negotiations, citing numerous shortcomings in governance and democratic development. Among the other findings, the Republic of Macedonia was criticized for the ongoing lack of political dialogue, failing to meet international election standards, and the ineffective functioning of political institutions, Parliament in particular. There are also concerns about a growing concentration of government power. The Macedonian public is strongly pro-American, and U.S. influence needs to remain an important stabilizing factor in Macedonia.

To address the current environment and opportunities to advance the country’s democratic reforms, USAID programs work to institutionalize the connections between the citizens and their government. Our objectives:  1) Entrench a sense of civic empowerment through a more robust, experienced and effective civil society that practices advocacy, policy analysis and regular consultation with government.  2)  Build trust in political processes by reconnecting political parties to their electorate and institutionalizing connections between the Parliament and the people.  3)  Increase independence and efficiency within the judiciary to further embed rule of law and act as a counterweight to other branches of government.  4)  Encourage institutionalization of transparency, accountability and responsiveness to the public in local and national government structures.  USAID also plans to re-engage in media programming to empower media to act as the fourth estate to connect the people and their leaders and to further protect freedom of the press

USAID assistance to Macedonia was scheduled to phase out in 2011. However, following an inter-agency review process, assistance has been extended through at least 2015. As a result, a number of assessments, evaluations and program designs will take place in 2009 and 2010 to determine how best to target assistance funds to address the above-stated objectives.

The DLG-OD will be required to have the academic and work experience to be a master of an extensive range of DG -related issues.  He/she must possess expert-level technical knowledge and have demonstrated expertise at project design and implementation, including methodologies and philosophies that guide development program design and that draw from experiences in other countries analogous to Macedonia.  The DLG-OD will be expected to serve as a mentor for USAID’s Macedonia staff and American Junior Officers and to actively work to build their capacity and technical knowledge.

The DLG-OD will report to the Mission Director, but he/she will be expected to operate with great independence in dealing with complex programs and high-level government and donor counterparts in guiding the design and management of a comprehensive set of technical assistance programs.  Due to the high level of responsibility in this position, the DLG-OD will have considerable latitude in the exercise of her/his duties for program design, management, and evaluation, and for the identification and resolution of issues affecting program performance both within and outside of the Mission.

He/she will have the following specific duties.

•	Provide leadership on the development and implementation of USAID/Macedonia DG programs in a manner designed to promote their consistency with other political, democracy, governance and justice objectives of the Government of Macedonia (GOM) and USG, and which replace and build on the successes of current activities which are scheduled to end between 2009-2011.  The DLG-OD will have overall responsibility for the development and implementation of Mission administration of good governance, civil society, parliamentary reform, political party strengthening and media programs and assist in coordinating their planning and execution with senior GOM, donor, and relevant USG officials, as well as coordination with other Embassy programs.  Responsibilities may include serving as contracting officer’s (or agreement officer’s) technical representative (COTR or AOTR) for one or more projects.

•	Provide authoritative policy and operational guidance to the Mission Director and DG team for program design, development and implementation.  This includes guidance to team members to conceptualize, implement, and report on the new and ongoing activities in the DG portfolio.

•	Guide the development of the DG project/program-funded budget; working with technical advisors and senior management to determine funding needs and uses.  Provide close supervision of project mortgages, pipelines, and funding requirements.

•	Analyze economic, political, and other trends affecting democratic development.  Identify ways to further meet both USG foreign policy and GOM reform policy objectives in Macedonia.  Provide authoritative input in the formulation of USAID’s strategy, annual report, program reviews, and other activities and events as requested by Mission management.

•	Liaise with top level government officials including at the state secretary, deputy minister and minister level, as well as with mayors and other local government officials.  This includes working to build consensus on topics where there may be disagreement between Macedonian government officials; between the USG and Macedonian government officials; and/or between private sector actors and Macedonian government officials.  The DLG-OD will guide and play a leading role in the development and maintenance of active dialogue on the development of key policy initiatives and institutional reforms.

•	Liaise with representatives of other USG agencies in Macedonia, national and local representatives of Macedonian government agencies, international and local NGOs, and other donors related to design and implementation of democracy activities.  Play an active role in donor coordination, including attending and participating in sector-appropriate meetings to support the development of democracy and local governance with officials of other Embassies, international organizations, volunteer organizations, bilateral and multi-lateral donors.

•	Represent USAID on the U.S. Embassy Rule of Law Working Group and other related Working Groups that may be formed, coordinating USAID activities with other USG efforts related to democracy, governance and anti-corruption.

•	The DLG-OD will draw on his/her experience to help develop staff and support collaboration with other Mission offices.  This includes mentoring DG staff in technical, programmatic, budgetary, managerial and staff supervisory areas, and assist in the hiring and training of FSN staff to ensure that adequate support is provided for efficient and effective office operations.

•	Perform other tasks, as requested by Mission management, and which are consistent with the advisory, managerial, and reporting requirements of the position of DLG-OD for USAID/Macedonia.

Current DG programs are described on USAID/Macedonia’s web site at http://macedonia.usaid.gov/.  


b. Period of Performance
	
	The Contractor's period of performance for the above services shall be for one year with possible one year extension, subject to Mission approval. 
	
	
	c. Place of performance

<DESC><p>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), Contracting Division, Software Section (DITCO/PL8321), 2300 East Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5406, is requesting quotes for a brand name open market purchase of FlipFactory video transcoding software for use at DMA in Alexandria, VA. The software being procured is proprietary and protected by copyright laws. Only Telestream and its authorized resellers may provide this software and required maintenance. The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price purchase order. This is a 100% small business set aside. The NAICS code is 541512 for this procurement.
<p>The justification detailing the government's essential need for Telestream's FlipFactory video transcoding software is as follows. DVI has developed the Defense Imagery Server (DIS) over the past several years using a COTS product known as Artesia DAM from OpenText Corp. The system was put into production last year for digital still images. This year they are expanding the media types managed by the DIS to include digital motion imagery (digital video). IPV format WMV files and seamless integration with Artesia DAM are only obtainable via the FlipFactory Adapter from OpenText. DVI already owns this adapter, thus the Telestream FlipFactory product is the final piece required to make digital video available through the Defense Imagery Server. This is a true &lsquo;plug and play' video integration effort, saving the government thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours in software development.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>See the attached "Needs List" spreadsheet for specific product requirements. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting clear evidence of their capability to provide/perform.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is a request for competitive proposals. All responses must be received within 4 business days of publication of this synopsis to be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

General Description:The Contractor shall provide professional, non-personal services as follows:EPA 1631E - Total Mercury in Water: Samples are oxidized with the addition of BrCl. Samples are analyzed by SnCl2 reduction, followed by gold amalgamation, thermal desorption, and atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (CVAFS). EPA 1630 (BR-0011) - Monomethyl Mercury in Water: Aqueous samples are distilled from Teflon distillation vials. Samples are then analyzed by ethylation, Tenax trap pre-concentration, gas chromatography separation, pyrolytic combustion, and are then analyzed by ethylation, Tenax trap pre concentration, gas chromatography separation, pyrolytic combustion and atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (CV-GC-AFS). EPA 1630, Modified (BR-0011) - Monomethyl Mercury in Soil/Sediment: Soil/sediment samples are prepared by acid bromide/methyl chloride extraction. Samples are then analyzed by ethylation, Tenax trap pre-concentration, gas chromatography separation, pyrolytic combustion, and atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (CV-GC-AFS). EPA 1631, Appendix - Total Mercury in Tissue: Tissue samples are acid-digested with heat and further oxidized with BrCl. Samples are analyzed by SnCl2 reduction, followed by gold amalgamation, thermal desorption, and atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (CVAFS). EPA 1630, Modified (BR-0011) - Monomethyl Mercury in Tissue: Biological samples are digested in a KOH/methanol solution. Samples are then analyzed by ethylation, Tenax trap pre-concentration, gas chromatography separation, pyrolytic combustion, and atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (CV-GC-AFS). SM 2540G - Total solids: determined for sediments and biological samples.
BRL SOP BR-0106 - Homogenization of all samples prior to analyses
Technical Requirements:The Contractor will be responsible for all analytical aspects of this effort and shall furnish all necessary services, materials, labor, and supplies. The contractor must have available all of the equipment required to perform the analyses as proposed, as well as the equipment needed to prepare the samples for analyses and the freezer capacity to store the samples before and after the analysis. The Contractor must homogenize appropriate samples so that replicate analyses meet the criteria listed under Quality Assurance. The Limit of Detection is the "Method Limit of Detection" as described by the Environmental Protection Agency in 40 CFR Part 136, Appendix B follows:Analyte 	Method 	Matrix 	MDL  Total Hg 	EPA 1631 	Water 	0.15 ng/LMethyl Hg 	EPA 1630 	Water 	0.020 ng/LMethyl Hg 	EPA 1630, Modified 	Sediment 	0.008 ng/g (wet)Total Solids 	SM 2540G 	Sediment 	0.10% Total Hg 	EPA 1631, Appendix 	Tissue 	0.04 ng/g (wet)Methyl Hg 	EPA 1630, Modified 	Tissue 	1.0 ng/g (wet)Total Solids 	SM 2540G 	Tissue 	0.10%Homogenization 	BRL SOP BR-0106 	Tissue 	N/A
Quality Assurance:To assure precision, duplicate samples will be analyzed at a rate of 5%, with at least one duplicate per matrix per analytical run. To assure accuracy, a sample will be fortified with a known quantity of analyte and analyzed at a rate of 5 %, with at least one matrix spike (MS) per matrix per analytical run. To assure precision, matrix spike duplicate (MSD) samples will be analyzed in conjunction with MS samples at a rate of 5%, with at least one MSD per matrix per analytical run. At a rate of 5%, a procedural blank will be analyzed. A minimum of one certified reference material (CRM) will be analyzed per analytical run. The principal measure of accuracy used to assess the quality of data submitted will be the recovery of spiked analyte. The average recovery of analyte from spiked tissue should be between 65% and 135%; relative percent difference (RPD) ? 35%. In computing the averages, only valid spikes will be used. In a valid spike, the amount of analyte added is at least as much as was present in the sample originally. CRMs also serve as a measure of the accuracy of the analysis. The assessment of the reference material analyses will be based on the range in the certification as well as the precision of the analysis. The principal measure of precision will be the average RPD between duplicates.
Deliverables:The deliverables are the results of the sample analyses, which will be reported both electronically and as a hard copy. The report will include: 1. a description of the samples, their condition on receipt, and storage prior to analysis (including receiving logs and chain of custody forms) 2. a summary of the analytical procedures, and 3. Analytical results, reported as ng/g or as % in the case of total solids. In addition, a Quality Assurance Report will include results of procedural blank analyses, duplicate analyses (including a computation of the average, and the relative percent difference), results of spiked sample analyses (including the percent recovery, and the amount in the original sample), estimates of the limit of detection, on a sample by sample basis, and a discussion of any problems with the analyses.

<DESC><p>The Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, tools, transportation, and equipment necessary to relocate, clear, mark, and paint 27.09 miles of the Government boundary line surrounding Sam Rayburn Reservoir, in accordance with the following specifications. Boundary line to be maintained (COE Segments 43 and 45) is located in Nacogdoches County between Etoile Park and Shirley Creek Park and was last maintained in 1994.&nbsp;The Government shall provide to the successful bidder one (1) set of real estate segment and tract maps covering the work area, and provide all boundary line signs and posts.&nbsp;The Contractor shall be responsible for locating the boundary line between Corps monuments within a tolerance of six (6&rdquo;) inches. The contractor shall rely solely on Corps boundary monuments and will not rely on any other existing markings such as stakes, pins, red paint, Government boundary signs, etc. In any case where line of sight cannot be obtained due to obstructions, the Contractor will still be required to locate the boundary line within six (6&rdquo;) inches. The Contractor will report in writing any missing or dislocated monuments at the next scheduled monthly meeting with the Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Representative (COR).&nbsp;Where monument(s) cannot be readily located, but have not been obviously displaced by shoreline erosion, the Contractor is required to use a Contractor supplied metal detector to search the area for buried or fragmented monument(s). Where siltation has covered the monument (or monument portions, in cases where monument has been damaged), soil overburden MUST be removed until Contractor is certain that the monument is indeed what is indicated by the metal detector. Where the Contractor is certain that a monument has been destroyed or removed, a flexible ORANGE corner post MUST be placed at the spot where the monument should be. This point will be derived by means of sighting the bearings with an accurate hand held compass and measuring by tape from adjacent monuments on either side of the missing monument. The Contractor will report any dislocated monuments at the next scheduled monthly meeting with the COR.&nbsp;Government property lines shall be cleared of vegetation to a width of five feet (5&rsquo;) and to a stump height not to exceed three inches (3&rdquo;). Some boundary line has been fenced, in which case an area one foot (1&rsquo;) wide will be cleared on the exterior of the fence and four feet (4&rsquo;) on the interior Government side of the fence. All woody vegetation will be cut from the fence, even if intertwined. All overhanging vegetation will be cleared to a height of seven feet (7&rsquo;). Trees of a diameter at breast height of four inches (4&rdquo;) or more will not be removed, but branches will be trimmed to the seven foot (7&rsquo;) height clearance.</p>

POINT-OF-CONTACT (POC):  Nancy Hilleary, Contract Specialist, Phone:  703-428-6120, FAX:  703-428-8181, E-MAIL:  Nancy.L.Hilleary@usace.army.mil<BR><BR>Request for Proposals:  Support to the Afghanistan Sustainable Infrastructure Plan<BR><BR>1.0  Introduction<BR>    	1.1 Background.  There is no comprehensive infrastructure plan for Afghanistan that brings together heterogeneous technical information on infrastructure programs incorporating economic, social, legal and political realities and stakeholder needs.  There is a paucity of analytic techniques and systematic cognitive frameworks that enable effective allocation of resources for sustainable infrastructure projects (over both space and time) in order to greatly enhance the return of investments to Afghan society.  The Afghanistan Sustainable Infrastructure Plan (ASIP) will apply a system of systems approach, providing tools that will assist program planners in the development of sustainable infrastructure capabilities in Afghanistan and the region, in support of national strategic objectives.  The ASIP methodology will addresses implications across five areas  political, security, rule of law, social well being, and economic growth and is based on Stakeholder Asset-based Planning Environment (SHAPE) methodology.  ASIP allows multiple actors to operate from a shared vision of Afghanistans infrastructure environment, to coordinate and to integrate intervention options through a common operational plan.  <BR><BR>1.2 Objective.  The objective of this contract is to bring together heterogeneous components of Afghanistan infrastructure-based programs that incorporate economic, social, legal and political realities to meet stakeholder needs in support of the goals of ASIP.  This is not about traditional engineering components of infrastructure but focused on those additional capabilities that are required to create a sustainable system in the Afghan environment  driving toward outcomes not outputs.  Additionally, the contractor will share the knowledge gained from other efforts to develop an overarching framework and enhance ASIP products.<BR><BR>2.0  Purpose<BR>The SOW defines the requirements for the tasks, the period of performance, communication methods, and interim and final deliverables.<BR><BR>3.0  Task Definition<BR>3.1  Task 1 - Ten Functions of the State<BR>As documented in the book, Fixing Failed States, by Ashraf Ghani and Clare Lockhart, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008) this task addresses ten (10) critical functions performed by a State.  The contractor shall relate these functions to Afghanistan, provide a status for each function, and make specific recommendations for implementation.<BR><BR>3.2  Task 2 - Support/Input for Workshops<BR>Contractor shall provide support for two workshops on ASIP to refine a model for a system of systems approach to the creation of sustainable infrastructure capabilities in the Afghan environment that incorporate economic, social, legal and political realities to meet stakeholder needs in support of the goals of ASIP.  One workshop will be held in Kabul, Afghanistan and one workshop will be held in Washington, DC.  The contractor shall participate in panels and other forums conducted at each workshop and shall provide input to workshop products.  The contractor shall make presentations of their work at each workshop, as determined by the Government.  The contractor shall not be responsible for organizing the workshops.<BR><BR>3.3  Task 3 - Critique and Support of Models<BR>The contractor shall review and comment on the system of systems model prior to the workshops (Part I), and shall perform a review and critique of the model following the workshops (Part II).  The contractor shall develop an overarching framework supported by the model that incorporates components important in Afghanistan such as international compacts, sovereignty strategies, shared rules, corruption, legitimacy and harmonization of donor resources. <BR><BR>3.4  Task 4 - Provide Expertise on the Environment<BR>The contractor shall serve as the subject matter expert, providing information and advice on all aspects of Afghanistan relevant to ASIP.  The contractor shall assist in making connections in-country and shall provide a list of points of contact.   <BR><BR>3.5  Task 5 - Analyze SHAPE/ASIP<BR>The contractor shall analyze and document the similarities, differences and interface between the SHAPE/ASIP planning methodology and their concepts and strategy for building state, market and civil society functions, identifying methodological, process, and terminology components.  The contractor shall use the outcome of the workshops and products of ASIP tools to develop and integrate implementation guidance based on the ASIP recommendations for Afghanistan.<BR><BR>3.6  Task 6 - Tools for Stability Operations<BR>The contractor shall identify tools and capabilities for measuring impact of stability operations, to analyze and document the similarities and differences between the tool Measuring Progress in Conflict Environments (MPICE) and other tools.  The contractor shall make recommendations for updating and integrating MPICE into strategic planning tools.<BR><BR>4.0  Period of Performance<BR>The period of performance is the date of award through 31 December 2009. <BR><BR>5.0  Government Furnished Information/Equipment<BR>The Government shall provide the contractor with the latest version of the system of systems model for use in the two workshops: specifically, SHAPE documentation, ASIP Tool documentation, workshops intent and results, and documentation for MPICE.<BR><BR>6.0  Critical Personnel<BR>The contractor shall strive to maintain the same team of managers and subject matter experts throughout the period of performance of this task order.  In the proposal, the contractor shall provide the names and resumes (if not already on file with the Government) of all critical management and technical personnel, and identify their functions with respect to the work to be performed.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.  Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—  (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.  (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  
In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

	(c)	Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
	(1)	Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  
In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 

Department of Homeland Security

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Oxygen Deficiency Monitor will be installed as a stand-alone instrument.  The system will be constructed out of corrosion-resistant materials and subsequent suitable treatments (e.g. anneals to weld joints) will be performed to remove any corrosion spots formed during the fabrication.  The system must be wall-mountable, i.e. able to be easily mounted on a wall without any additional equipment other than screws and/or brackets.  The total weight of the system must be specified to ensure the ease of wall mounting.  Also, the cross-sensitivity with other gases must be specified, including the type of gas that affects the sensor.  In addition, the system must be capable of being calibrated by the end user.  It is required that the Oxygen Deficiency Monitors satisfy the following requirements in terms of measurement range, accuracy, response time, and sensor type.  

Measurement Range: 	at least 2-100 % 
Accuracy: 		at least 0.5 %
Response Time: 	at least 500 ms
Sensor Type:		Must be laser diode at 760 nm with detector that measures 
			absorption by oxygen (evidenced by decrease in intensity 
			of light hitting detector)

(Capillary diffusion electrochemical cells do not satisfy the accuracy requirements for a helium rich environment)

Power requirements:	110 V/60 Hz (standard USA electrical plug)

Systems to be tested:  The environments that this Oxygen Deficiency Monitors will be checking are cryogenic facilities, specifically high magnetic field laboratories that use >100L of liquid helium in an enclosed environment.  

Safety:  The contractor shall provide all safety devices needed to assure the safe operation of the Oxygen Deficiency Monitors.  This may include, but is not limited to, a warning indicator if some component of system (e.g. sensor) fails, battery back-up in the event of electrical power failure, measures to prevent condensation developing on the sensor, etc.  The contractor shall specify the limits on ambient temperature, pressure, and humidity during operation of the system without causing damage to any part of the sensor. 

Measurement acquisition time:  The contractor shall provide an Oxygen Deficiency Monitors that can measure the helium rate in a time equal to or less than 0.5 second.  The contractor shall report the measurement error likely to occur by meeting this time requirement, as well as both the optimal time needed for the best measurement as well as the shortest time that their system requires for an acceptable measurement.  The time from start-up of the Oxygen Deficiency Monitors to operation (full accuracy) must be no more than 10 minutes.

Operating conditions:  This system will be required to operate at ambient temperature, pressure, and humidity conditions.  However, the contractor shall specify the limits of environmental conditions consistent with sound operation of their systems.  These can include, but are not limited to, temperature, humidity (RH% and condensing/non-condensing), and potential interference from magnetic fields, electric fields, radio waves, micro waves (e.g. ovens), fluorescent lighting, and vibrations.  

Alarms and Set Points:  The monitor shall have at least two set points available, which can be user programmed, for either a “high” reading (> 20.9% oxygen) or a low reading (<20.9% oxygen).  When above or below this set point, a visible and/or audible alarm must go off, as well as trip a relay that will connect to an external system for monitoring by the NIST emergency services.  The details of electrical power (current and voltage) available for this external relay must be specified.

<DESC>Synopsis: 

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p>The joint KC10/Kc135 ATS program is carefully considering a change in acquisition strategy for to address issues of schedule and resources within the Government. Please note that this VSR requirement was never set-aside for 100% Small Business participation. the Air Force continues to support a plan for full and open competition.<br />The new strategy would be to acquire separate VSR upgrades for the KC135 ATS and the KC-10 ATS. KC-135 ATS requirements would be rolled into the ATS follow-on solicitation now in pre-solicitation phase under FBO notice reference FA8223-10-R-135TS as an ATS task, representative of future upgrades and mods that would be accomplished within scope of that eventual ATS/CLS contract, and facilitating bidding for Fixed Rates that would be applied for out-years. For KC10 ATS, the program would acquire VSR as an upgrade (engineering change proposal) within the scope of the existing KC-10 ATS/CLS contract under the authority of the Changes Clause at FAR 52.243-1. In both programs, the Government would emphasize to ATS prime contractor(s) that they share our responsibility to evaluate multiple solutions and promote open competition. The Government would carefully consider the proposed acquisition processes and the selected subcontracted solution to ensure these interests are promulgated and small business participation would be specifically encouraged. The current performance specification would be valid for both of these efforts. Interested sources are invited to respond and comment to this potential revised strategy. Request you submit your input to Lance S Hardman, Contracting Officer, at lance.hardman@hill.af.mil. Responses need to be received no later than close of business, 8 May 2009.</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Air force is seeking information from interested parties on a space environment sensing capability that will address sensors and systems to collect space environmental parameters.&nbsp; Acquisition of the capability start in Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 2010 with an initial capability in GFY2015.&nbsp; The capability is required through GFY 2020.&nbsp; The Air Force has a requirement to continue to provide space environmental data in the most cost effective way possible when the DMSP mission ends.&nbsp; The requirement basis for this effort is the Natioanl Polar-Orbiting Environmental Satellite System NPOESS IORD-II, Joint Requirement Operations Council approved, Oct 2001.&nbsp; Furthermore this effort will be filling a void that will allow continuity of space environmental measurements and preservation of national capabilities required today and in the future as the United State formulates plans for&nbsp;National Space Situational Awareness architecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Air Force is interested in addressing the gap resulting from the de-manifestation of the space environmental sensing capabilities from the National Polar-Orbiting environmental Satellite System (NPOESS).&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important is the rapid collection, ingestion, processing, analysis, exploitation, and dissemination in a manner suitable to user needs.&nbsp; Therefore, the Air Force is interested in companies who understand both the operational systems in place to provide space environmental products and how to improve the sensor-toshooter chain of events to improce space environment situation awareness and application for strategic and tactical operations.&nbsp; The Air Force is evaluating all possible solutions sets, including the employment of commercial systems as a data provider with sensors already on-orbit or hosting sensors on future platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objective is to define an acquisition program that uses low-risk technologies (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 or greater) previously integrated on a bus and launch vehicles (if necessary) provided by contractors with a documented proven track record of mission success. We encourage collaboration among industry partners to identify innovative approaches for exploiting already available data to provide parameters we are seeking. For planning purposes, we would anticipate an incremental delivery strategy to rapidly fill the data collection gap, while concurrently investing in space weather modeling and system effects Science and Technology essential to translate measurements into actionable space weather products. This is in line with the Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent for Space's letter dated 14 March 2007, titled "'Back to Basics' and Implementing a Block Approach for Space Acquisition".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;16b. PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current, existing technologies (or with possible minor modifications) that can be used to meet the sensing capabilities described in this paragraph and paragraph 16d. Cost is a major consideration; therefore, the government is interested in cost information for individual requirements defined in paragraph 16d. The DMSG program office is interested in information from Industry as well as Government Labs.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the Government is working with the nation's national laboratories to leverage their wealth of knowledge in space environment. The complement of government resources and industry experts would provide an overall space environment sensing and exploitation program that optimizes the investment. We are not seeking competition between government labs and industry. The government team will conduct a thorough analysis of present and future space environment models, applications, system effects algorithms, and decision aids and generate roadmaps and product threads for delivering improved space environment situation awareness user products using Space Situational Awareness Environmental Monitoring (SSAEM) data.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The Air Force will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.</p>

<p>AFWA - Air Force Weather Agency <br />C3 - Command, Control and Communications <br />DMSP - Defense Meteorological Satellite Program<br />DoD - Department of Defense <br />EDR - Environmental Data Record <br />GFY - Government Fiscal Year <br />ICD - Interface Control Document <br />IOC - Initial Operational Capability<br />IORD - Integrated Operational Requirements Document <br />KPP - Key Performance Parameters<br />KSA - Key Support Areas<br />NPOESS - National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System <br />POC - Point of Contact<br />RFI - Request for Information <br />SDR - Sensor Data Record<br />SSAEM - Space Situational Awareness Environmental Monitoring<br />TRL -Technology Readiness Level</p>
<p>&nbsp;16d. SENSING CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT</p>
<p>For this effort, the IORD-II ionospheric electron density profile characteristics and scintillation measurements are considered Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and must be satisfied. We are searching for possible solutions to satisfy the remaining Environmental Data Records (EDRs), considered as Key Support Areas (KSA) and are seeking possible innovative approaches to solve multiple requirements. The following list is the environmental data records as approved by the Senior User Advisory Group in priority order and are based on recommendations from the NPOESS Joint Agency Requirements Group:</p>
<p>1. Electron Density Profile<br />2. Ionospheric Scintillation<br />3. Neutral Density Profile<br />4. Auroral Imagery<br />5. Auroral Energy Deposition<br />6. Auroral Particles<br />7. Energetic Ions<br />8. Electric Field<br />9. Medium Energy Particles<br />10. Geomagnetic Field<br />11. In-Situ Plasma Temperatures<br />12. In-Situ Plasma Fluctuations<br />13. Auroral Boundary</p>
<p>AFSPC top model/system effects product groupings are list below:</p>
<p>1. Ionospheric Parameters to Feed Physics-Based Ionospheric Models<br />2. Scintillation <br />3. Radar <br />4. Satellite</p>
<p>The Air Force is considering alternatives for acquiring space environmental data in support of the KPPs and KSAs. The system may include an orbital hardware follow-on concept, leveraging of planned programmed assets (both ground and space-based), and/or shared/purchased data and must address the operational data processing to ready the Sensor Data Records (SDR) and EDRs for deposition in an environmental database. Any system technology with a DoD TRL less than 7 (each component must have been demonstrated successfully on-orbit) shall not be included unless the company can show a path to flight worthiness via a Space Test Program launch or other means. We expect the most economic path to success for sensor measurements is available through hosting sensors on rides of opportunity.</p>
<p>The ground component must include any required software required to calculate appropriate engineering parameters for insertion into the Air Force Weather Agency's (AFWA) operational database. Any manipulation of the data beyond calculating SDRs and EDRs is not part of this effort; however, the contractors must understand the current and planned data processing algorithms beyond EDRs, global modeling, and system effects products.</p>
<p>We expect respondents to be challenged by selecting sensors and sensor suites to satisfy the KPPs while looking for avenues to satisfy KSAs and having the right data to drive models resulting in high quality system effects products. We expect a variety of options with pros, cons, risks, and discussion of trade space for the government to consider. Government investment of sensors on-orbit or planned that can fulfill requirements via alternative data processing is highly encouraged.</p>
<p>Command, control, and communications (C3) ground system trades may include maintaining/upgrading Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) or other legacy systems or commercial options. For planning purposes, anticipate a first launch availability of 1st quarter GFY 2015. Baseline spacecraft life should be 5 years with a probability of success greater than or equal to 70%. Other architectures are encouraged as long as they are cost effective and do not require increased system development. Though the baseline concept is outlined above for reference, respondents with a proven track record are encouraged to submit innovative alternatives that represent low risk and provide incremental improvements.</p>
<p>Responses should address the technologies available to deliver environmental data as described with supporting structures such as launch, spacecraft requirements and C3. The respondent should provide cost and schedule assumptions associated with each technology addressed. The Air Force is interested in separate cost and schedule estimates for each area. The cost estimate should also include software to process the satellite data stream into SDRs and EDRs at AFWA and ready them for deposition into an operational database.</p>
<p>The following assumptions should be used for cost and schedule estimation: <br />1. Cost/schedule estimate will be at 80% confidence level and responders may also include figures from various confidence levels if desired<br />2. Spacecraft/payload life should be 5 years with a probability of success greater than or equal to 70%<br />3. Solutions will be low risk by using TRL 7 or greater<br />4. IOC is 3rd quarter GFY 2015 with capability required through GFY 2020<br />5. 3rd quarter GFY 2010 contract award<br />6. Costs should be broken out to the lowest level possible - costs should be identified by individual EDRs and sensor<br />7. Include program level costs - Systems Engineering, Program Management, Integration, Assembly and Test Full-Time Equivalent support, etc<br />8. EDRs #1 and #2 must be satisfied, all other EDRs are optional, but highly desirable<br />9. Include software costs to process/prepare the satellite data stream for insertion into AFWA's operational database. Once AWFA has the data, no further effort is required.<br />10. Costs should be separated between development and production costs<br />11. Provide time-phased costs and detailed information on inflation rates used<br />12. Do not include award fee in cost estimate<br />13. Include discussion of any cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations<br />14. Each solution's detailed cost estimate should be accompanied by a matrix-style summary spreadsheet showing how each option satisfies the EDRs and their respective costs - i.e. Option 1 has 2 sensors; sensor 1 satisfies EDRs 1 and 3 and costs $XX, sensor 2 satisfies EDR 2 and costs $XY, etc</p>
<p>Again, these assumptions are given for cost estimation and planning purposes only and the government is only seeking information for market research purposes.</p>
<p>16e. SENSING CAPABILITY DESIRED TECHNICAL GOALS</p>
<p>The baseline requirement set is the current NPOESS IORD-II (available on request). This includes spacecraft collection and processing and transmission to proposed ground sites as well as Objective and Threshold performance requirements.</p>
<p>16f. SENSING CAPABILITY SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE</p>
<p>Following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI. This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government. Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their responses as they see fit.</p>
<p>Section 1 - Technological Alternatives</p>
<p>Briefly describe one or more technological alternatives, including the reliability, flight heritage and technology readiness characteristics of the alternatives. (3-5 pages per alternative)</p>
<p>Section 2 - Feasibility Assessment</p>
<p>Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks. (1 page per alternative)</p>
<p>Section 3 - Cost and Schedule Estimates</p>
<p>Provide cost and schedule estimates for each alternative. The desired business information is an 80% confidence estimate of cost and schedule risk to produce a cost effective system. These assumptions are given for cost estimation purposes only and the government is only seeking information for market research purposes. (2-3 pages)</p>
<p>The assumptions in paragraph 16d may be used for cost and schedule estimation.</p>
<p>Section 4 - Corporate Expertise</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), through its National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), will release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the establishment of Regional Test Centers (RTCs) to test small wind turbines to International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) small wind turbine (SWT) test standards, plus any tests in the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) draft standards that are not in the IEC standards. 

Background: Reducing barriers to the expansion of wind energy is an important goal for DOE’s Wind and Hydropower Technologies Program.  One of the barriers for the distributed wind market is the lack of small turbines that are independently tested and certified.  The small wind turbine buying public has long needed a means of distinguishing good, safe wind turbines from products that do not perform as advertised or are hazardous.  The IEC has developed standards for testing and evaluation of small wind turbines.  NREL has developed a testing capability that is accredited by the American Association of Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) and is widely recognized as a competent testing organization.  DOE/NREL proposes to partner with other entities to establish small wind Regional Test Centers (RTCs).  These RTCs will expand small wind turbine testing capability within the United States and allow cost effective testing of small wind turbines to the IEC standard.  These test results can be used to obtain third party certification by the Small Wind Certification Council (SWCC) or other certification body.  It is anticipated that a large number of tested and certified turbines will help grow the industry by increasing consumer acceptance of Small Wind Turbine (SWT) technology.  Other anticipated benefits include: 
-	Providing locations where potential buyers can see wind turbines in action
-	Provide a focus for workforce and curriculum development efforts at post secondary institutions
-	Broader knowledge within the SWT turbine community about how SWTs work.

Objectives 
1)  To establish Regional Test Centers capable of testing small wind turbines to IEC small wind turbine test standards.
2)  To conduct independent testing, per the IEC small wind test standards, to provide high-quality, independent test results for up to eight small turbines.  It is anticipated that the test results may be used by the turbine manufacturer to apply for certification from a certification body, such as SWCC, for the tested turbine.

The solicitation will target entities capable of conducting high quality testing of small wind turbines.  It will be the responsibility of the RTCs to find one or more small wind turbine manufacturers with turbines to test, with which to partner.  These turbines should be commercially available turbines that have a high probability of success in the US market over the next several years.  

Solicitation Plan 
DOE/NREL plans to release an RFP in summer 2009.  DOE/ NREL anticipates awarding subcontracts to up to four RTCs to test a total of up to eight turbines.  NREL intends to use a firm fixed price type of subcontract.  DOE/NREL currently intends to offer price support of up to $150,000 per subcontract based on testing two wind turbines.  The subcontract value will be independent of the size of the turbine and the installation requirements.  DOE/NREL expects the period of performance to run for 30-36 months.

NREL plans to provide technical assistance to the RTCs based upon DOE funding.  This assistance may include an annual RTC conference, visits by NREL personnel, and providing assistance as needed on an informal basis.  

Planned Scope of Work
The RTC will establish the infrastructure (facilities, staff, & equipment) necessary to test small wind turbines to the IEC standard.  The RTC will coordinate with the manufacturer for installation of the turbine systems at its site, evaluate the turbines through testing and other observations over a test period of up to 18 months (need to meet duration standard of 2500 hours of operation), and report its findings on a publically available web site.   DOE/NREL expects the wind turbine manufacturer to provide a complete turbine system to the RTC, provide documentation, and assist with installation and maintenance.  

Planned Requirements
Proposed RTCs must have, or be able to procure, the facilities, staff, and equipment required to conduct testing to IEC standards and be able to raise at least the minimum price participation (20%).

Turbines to be tested must meet the following criteria
a.	Manufacturer’s ability to manufacture and supply turbines for the U.S. market, and provide the associated installation & maintenance support. 
b.	Generate electricity for use on a 60 Hz AC grid or for a 12, 24, 36, or 48v battery system.  Mechanical turbines and direct connect (variable voltage) generator/motor configurations will not be accepted;
c.	Rotor swept area less than or equal to 200 m2;
d.	New, not refurbished;
e.	Meet National Electric Code (NEC) electrical safety requirements such as circuit protection and anti-islanding provisions; 
f.	Available for shipment and installation at the RTC.

Planned Selection Criteria
a.	Business plan to ensure the RTC can remain in business after DOE/NREL funding is no longer available.
b.	Past experience with small wind turbines and testing
c.	Experience & knowledge of proposed staff
d.	Suitability of the proposed facilities & equipment for wind turbine testing
e.	Price participation
f.	Plan to release test results to the public

DOE/NREL will also consider RTC diversity, turbine configuration diversity and geographic diversity. 
 
Note
The RFP will require the RTC to provide information about proposed staffing, facilities and equipment, past experience with small wind turbines and testing, and business plan sustainability.  For each turbine the RTC proposes to test the RFP will require information such as: power curve; selling cost; turbine features; maintenance requirements; warranty; UL rating of the inverter and other components; sales history, especially in the last year; number of turbines currently installed; tower options; number of dealers/installers; manufacturing volume capacity; and, the capabilities to support the product for the life of the turbine system.  

Expressions of Interest 
The purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to obtain an indication of the level of interest by industry participants, both potential RTCs and small wind turbine manufacturers in the project described in the Solicitation Plan and to develop a Bidders List.  Failure to respond to this notice will not disqualify anyone from participation in the solicitation, but those that do respond to this notice are assured of receiving the RFP & notification of related activities, and of being listed in the RFP if so desired.  

Expressions of interest should not include detailed proposals, but should include the following information: the names, addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers and email addresses of the primary contact person; a statement indicating whether or not the respondent wishes to receive a copy of the RFP, a statement indicating whether the participant wishes to be listed in the RFP, and (optionally) comments on the proposed Regional Test Center project.  Potential RTCs may provide a brief background of their small wind and testing experience. Small wind turbine manufacturers may provide a brief description of the turbine (a brochure may be provided); NREL proposes to list interested potential RTCs and manufacturers in the RFP to make it easier for potential participants to find partners. Responses to this notice should not exceed – 5 pages; a product brochure may be attached to the response.  Responses should be received at NREL by 29 May 2009.  This is not a request for proposals.  Please send responses (by mail, facsimile or email) to

<p><br />PROGRAM OVERVIEW</p>
<p>Goal: This program supports the USAF Academy Dean of Faculty. Goal is to provide for familiarization and orientation of operation of Class 3 (greater than 50 lbs less than 1250) unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Class 3 vehicles are necessary to model the size, scope and controls future Air Force officers will encounter in the operational environment, smaller scale UAS systems do not meet educational objectives. Program is be delivered on site at USAFA for approximately 30 cadets and faculty per session during 2 separate sessions, one in summer and the other in early fall. Contractor is to provide all necessary equipment, transportation, communications, remote computer operations, power personnel and other resources required to provide self-contained, comprehensive orientation to operation of UAS and components, such as sensors, auto-pilot and other systems involved in search and reconnaissance operations. Familiarization and demonstration must include the ability for students to participate in experiential learning in conjunction with contractor instruction in a dual-controlled instructor override environment. Contractor will be responsible for all aspects of flight safety during the orientation/demonstration program.</p>
<p>The goal of the operational orientation and demonstration is to reinforce concepts that will be delivered by USAFA instructors in areas such as weather, planning, mission development, tactics, intelligence surveillance, reconnaissance and airmanship concepts. In addition to classroom instruction, USAFA instructors will be on site during UAS operations providing training in the field concurrently with experiential learning provided by contractor.</p>
<p>Specifics of operation duration: Contractor service is required as follows: <br />12 July to 2 August: Contactor is required to operate a 10-hour flight day to permit four 2.5-hour sorties operating during daytime hours between 6am to 6 pm, daily Monday through Friday. Each student is to obtain at least 5 instructional flights of 40-minute duration during the scheduled period. A 2-day weather allowance is included in this schedule. Expected number of students is between 25 and 30.<br />1 September though 30 September: During the September period the contractor is required to operate 2 hours per day on alternating days (excluding weekends). Each student is to obtain at least 5 instructional flights of 40-minute duration during the scheduled month. Expected number of students is between 25 and 30.</p>
<p>Government provided support: Latrine services, potable water, land mobile radios and field tents will be provided to support the operation. No utilities or infra-structure exists on site. Contractors may leave assets on site however no security will be provided by USAFA.</p>
<p>Notice: The site for this service is the Aardvark location which consists of a landing strip and open-space. Airspace to be utilized is USAFA property geographically located in the Jack's Valley. USAFA will provide landing strip and work with contractor to obtain FAA certification of authorization (COA) for operations over designated area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Questions for potential offerors:</p>
<p>1. Do you have a Class 3 Unmanned Aerial System with dual-controlled instructor override environment that would be available by 12 July 2009 or other system that would provide instructor override during flight operation?</p>
<p>2. Has your proposed system been flight tested or do the specifics allow for flight at density altitude of 14,000 feet in climatic conditions associate with mountain conditions existing at USAFA?</p>
<p>3. Has your system obtained an FAA experimental certification or are you currently operating under an existing certificate of operation (COA)?</p>
<p>4. Has your company (either directly or with partners) ever supported a demonstration orientation program of this nature?</p>

<p><br />PROGRAM OVERVIEW</p>
<p>Goal: This program supports the USAF Academy Dean of Faculty. Goal is to provide for familiarization and orientation of operation of Class 3 (greater than 50 lbs less than 1250) unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Class 3 vehicles are necessary to model the size, scope and controls future Air Force officers will encounter in the operational environment, smaller scale UAS systems do not meet educational objectives. Program is be delivered on site at USAFA for approximately 30 cadets and faculty per session during 2 separate sessions, one in summer and the other in early fall. Contractor is to provide all necessary equipment, transportation, communications, remote computer operations, power personnel and other resources required to provide self-contained, comprehensive orientation to operation of UAS and components, such as sensors, auto-pilot and other systems involved in search and reconnaissance operations. Familiarization and demonstration must include the ability for students to participate in experiential learning in conjunction with contractor instruction in a dual-controlled instructor override environment. Contractor will be responsible for all aspects of flight safety during the orientation/demonstration program.</p>
<p>The goal of the operational orientation and demonstration is to reinforce concepts that will be delivered by USAFA instructors in areas such as weather, planning, mission development, tactics, intelligence surveillance, reconnaissance and airmanship concepts. In addition to classroom instruction, USAFA instructors will be on site during UAS operations providing training in the field concurrently with experiential learning provided by contractor.</p>
<p>Specifics of operation duration: Contractor service is required as follows: <br />12 July to 2 August: Contactor is required to operate a 10-hour flight day to permit four 2.5-hour sorties operating during daytime hours between 6am to 6 pm, daily Monday through Friday. Each student is to obtain at least 5 instructional flights of 40-minute duration during the scheduled period. A 2-day weather allowance is included in this schedule. Expected number of students is between 25 and 30.<br />1 September though 30 September: During the September period the contractor is required to operate 2 hours per day on alternating days (excluding weekends). Each student is to obtain at least 5 instructional flights of 40-minute duration during the scheduled month. Expected number of students is between 25 and 30.</p>
<p>Government provided support: Latrine services, potable water, land mobile radios and field tents will be provided to support the operation. No utilities or infra-structure exists on site. Contractors may leave assets on site however no security will be provided by USAFA.</p>
<p>Notice: The site for this service is the Aardvark location which consists of a landing strip and open-space. Airspace to be utilized is USAFA property geographically located in the Jack's Valley. USAFA will provide landing strip and work with contractor to obtain FAA certification of authorization (COA) for operations over designated area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Questions for potential offerors:</p>
<p>1. Do you have a Class 3 Unmanned Aerial System with dual-controlled instructor override environment that would be available by 12 July 2009 or other system that would provide instructor override during flight operation?</p>
<p>2. Has your proposed system been flight tested or do the specifics allow for flight at density altitude of 14,000 feet in climatic conditions associate with mountain conditions existing at USAFA?</p>
<p>3. Has your system obtained an FAA experimental certification or are you currently operating under an existing certificate of operation (COA)?</p>
<p>4. Has your company (either directly or with partners) ever supported a demonstration orientation program of this nature?</p>
<p>5. Are there civilian entities that operate your system?</p>
<p>6. If you company has provided a program of this nature, do you have an existing flight training syllabus that could be used to meet the program objectives or can you develop a training syllabus for flight operations by 12 July 2009?</p>
<p>7. In order to provide this program would you need to leave assets at USAFA?</p>
<p>8. Please provide an estimate of anticipated cost for both sessions as defined.</p>
<p>9. Please provide any market literature available regarding your Class 3 system and/or orientation/demonstration program.</p>

<DESC><p>Notice: As a result of response to the RFI and participation by vendors at the UAS Industry Day, two or more 8(a) firms, capable of doing the work, have expressed interest in the requirement. Therefore, in following FAR 19 policy, this requirement will be set aside for 8(a). As briefed, the potential for the UAS program at USAFA could develop into other opportunities for industry in the future and we will be compiling and providing the questions and answers that were asked for this and future reference. We are thankful for the interest expressed and input provided in support of the UAS Industry Day event.</p>

<DESC>DESC invites expressions of interest from other potential offerors. Any firms desiring consideration must fully identify, in writing, their capabilities to deliver diesel and jet fuels from algal oils by the contract start date of June 1, 2009. Expressions of interest are due by May 1, 2009. 

The Defense Energy Support Center is exploring the method of using applied research and development to convert algal oils into diesel and jet fuels. This is the proprietary process of Solazyme to produce crude oil from a variety of domestically grown plant feedstocks (including various molecular sugars,  including cellulosics and organic waste streams) through the medium of algae that can be further refined into military grade diesel and jet fuel.  The production will support the Navy’s requirements for their certification program for F-76 fuel derived from oil produced by algae grown using a heterotrophic process.  The outcome of this project is to facilitate the increased production capacity of domestically produced renewable biofuels.

Under the authority of FAR 6.302, this requirement has been identified for non-competitive contract action.  Solazyme is identified as the only source capable of converting algal oils into diesel and jet fuels from a variety of domestically grown plant feedstocks.  It is DESC’s intent to enter into a contractual arrangement with Solazyme.

THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS WITH PROVEN METHODS OF USING TECHNOLOGY TO CONVERT ALGAL OILS INTO DIESEL AND JET FUELS.

DESC invites expressions of interest from other potential offerors. Any firms desiring consideration must fully identify, in writing, their capabilities to deliver diesel and jet fuels from algal oils by the contract start date of June 1, 2009. Expressions of interest are due by May 1, 2009.

The Willow Creek Bridge is currently a single span, steel girder bridge that contains a timber transverse nail laminated deck.  The bridge is single lane and is approximately 27’ in length and about 15.5’ wide.  There is existing railings on the bridge.  The superstructure is made of steel beams supporting a timber deck planks. The abutment foundations are assumed to be on spread footings.  The substructure consists of vertical concrete abutment walls with flared wings.  

The project work will require the removal of the bridge.  In addition, survey and staking and structure excavation will be required for the construction of the new bridge.  The new bridge will be a two-lane single span, having a superstructure that is precast prestressed concrete bulb girders, with a cast-in-place deck.  The substructure (foundation) will be steel H piles with concrete caps.  The new bridge railings are concrete, New Jersey safety shape.

Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.  An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. 

The NAICS code for this project is 541990.
The small business size standard is $7,000,000 per annum.

Background:
In 1979, the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) initiated site visit auditing and monitoring of phase1 clinical trials when it established the Clinical Trials Monitoring Service (CTMS) contract.  The first contractor for the CTMS contract was Besselar Associates; the contract included only phase 1 data collection and audits.  The CTMS contract was expanded in 1983 to include not only the phase 1 data collection and the phase 1 audit program, but also the Cooperative Group co-site visits and the Cancer Center and single institution audits. Since 1983 Theradex, Inc. has been the contractor. 

Purpose and Objectives:
The purpose of this project is to assist the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), NCI in fulfilling its responsibilities to meet the regulations set forth by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as an Independent New Drug (IND) sponsor and funding agency by monitoring NCI sponsored clinical trials. 

Project Requirements:
Major tasks required of the Contractor include the following:

1) Provide a protocol central patient registration, protocol patient data capture resource, and patient data quality control reviews for the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), NCI for clinical investigators conducting phase 0 (exploratory IND), phase 1 and selected phase 2 clinical trials.

2) Provide an on-site auditing resource for the DCTD to assure that contractors, grantees and other clinical investigators conducting phase 0, phase 1 and selected phase 2 clinical trials are in compliance with federal regulations, Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and NCI policies and procedures in order to verify submitted protocol patient data, assure the quality of submitted data, assure protocol compliance, and assure patient safety through proper reporting.

3) Assure the DCTD that the quality assurance programs of the Cooperative Groups, Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) Research Bases, the Clinical Trials Support Unit (CTSU), and other selected multi-institutional consortiums are actively monitoring their NCI sponsored clinical studies in compliance with the AGuidelines for Monitoring of Clinical Trials for Cooperative Groups, CCOP Research Bases, and the Cancer Trials Support Unit.” This shall be accomplished by attending as co-site visitors scheduled audits conducted by Cooperative Groups, Cancer Center CCOP Research Bases, and the CTSU or selected consortiums.

4) Assure the DCTD that all cancer centers, single institutions, multi-institutional consortiums and networks conducting clinical trials using DCTD sponsored trials are in compliance with Federal regulations, Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and NCI policies and procedures.  This oversight shall be accomplished by on site auditing at these institutions at least once every three years.

5) Assure the DCTD that international groups/institutions who are collaborators in DCTD sponsored clinical trials are conducting these trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) standards.  This shall be accomplished through training and administrative support for quality assurance programs to ensure that GCP clinical trial and regulatory standards are met, particularly the protection of human subjects.

6) There are two options associated with the requirement:

A:  Integration of NCI purchased Clinical Data Management System (CDMS) into Clinical Trials Monitoring Service processes, workflow and IT infrastructure.

 B:  Expand capability for conducting on-site audits to encompass the expanded scope of trials conducted under the auspices of the Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU). This expansion may also include clinical trials sponsored by other NCI Programs (SPORES, RAID and imaging).

Anticipated Period of Performance:
The anticipated period of performance is May 1, 2010 – April 30, 2011 with six (6), one (1) year award term option periods from May 1, 2011 – April 30, 2017.

DescriptionThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER), Office of Emergency Management (OEM), has a requirement to maintain and operate three diversely located Portable High-Throughput Integrated Laboratory Identification Systems (PHILIS) units.  The PHILIS units, each consisting of two to three separate mobile vehicles, are designed to detect Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs) and Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs).  These units provide on-site mobile laboratory capabilities to support the EPA?s Environmental Response Laboratory Network (ERLN), to respond to chemical warfare agent attacks, and to provide analytical support to any supplemental locations that are deemed fundamental to accomplishing EPA?s mission.  
In addition, the PHILIS units may: 	Participate in EPA and interagency exercises 	Participate in activities in foreign countries 	Deploy to Superfund sites to perform environmental analyses at the request of EPA Regional Offices 	Function at their bases of operations or at sites of interest to EPA to analyze routine and non-routine analytical samples 	Support method development and method validation efforts 	Support EPA?s training efforts for the Laboratory Response Corps.
The Government intends to award this effort as an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with one (1) 2-year base period, one (1) 2-year award term and one (1) 3-year award term. The Government contemplates release of the solicitation on or about May 12, 2009, with proposals due thirty (30) days after the release date. The solicitation will be synopsized in FedBizOpps (https://www.fbo.gov) and on the US EPA Office of Acquisition Management website (http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/ersc/PHILIS/index.htm).

Proposals will be evaluated on the above factors using a numbered rating scheme from `5? (response is superior in most features) to `0? (factor is not addressed or is totally deficient and without merit.)
The Government will host a contractor site visit to be conducted after the RFP is released.  This site visit will offer potential contractors the opportunity to inspect the mobile laboratories.  Information about the site visit will be posted on the website referenced below after the RFP is released.

<SOLNBR>RFI-GCSS-J
<RESPDATE>050409
<CONTACT>Randy Dreyer, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-681-0305, Email Randy.Dreyer@disa.mil - Edward Shannon Frank, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-681-0327, Fax 703-681-0521, Email Edward.Frank@disa.mil
<DESC><p><br /><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) SUMMARY:</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Global Combat Support System-Joint (GCSS-J) program is an Acquisition Category 1AC/Major Automated Information System (ACT 1AC/MAIS) IT application that continues to transition to a service oriented architecture to deliver asset visibility to the joint logistician (i.e., essential capabilities, functions, activities, and tasks necessary to sustain all elements of operating forces in theater at all levels), and facilitates information interoperability across and between Combat Support and Command and Control functions. GCSS-J provides applications, decision support tools, and visualization mechanisms that enable the joint logistician to rapidly assess and analyze information to make critical decisions.</p>
<p>In an agile development environment (build a little, test a little) design, development, integration, and testing occur in parallel and continuously through a series of sprints. Each sprint development cycle is approximately 4 weeks long. GCSS-J has implemented an agile development process to rapidly develop and deliver critical capabilities to the joint logistics warfighter. This strategy supports fielding, at a minimum, two capability releases annually replacing the traditional "block" approach of releasing capabilities/functionality every 18 months.</p>
<p>Capabilities can be defined as system enhancements, functional enhancements to existing GCSS-J capabilities and applications, integration of external applications via single sign-on, or federating external applications via Unified Resource Locator, making joint logistics applications accessible via GCSS-J in a fully integrated manner. GCSS-J is available on both the Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) and Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) and includes net-centric services as they are available and practical to use via Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES). GCSS-J requires a SIPRNet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate, and for the NIPRNet, a Common Access Card (CAC).</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT: This is a Nonpersonal service as defined in FAR Part 37.101. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Global Combat Support System-Joint (GCSS-J) Program Management Office (PMO), in coordination with DISA's Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), is requesting information to determine sources with CORE competencies and demonstrated experience in developing and sustaining combat support/combat support services (CS/CSS) software for the GCSS-J.</p>
<p>To achieve the mission requirements, GCSS-J requires an innovative and technically capable contractor team who understands state-of-the-art technology, web services technology, service oriented architecture (SOA), agile development processes, and has a large number of readily available software development engineers that can be matrixed into the GCSS-J activities on an as needed basis. Proven expertise and capabilities in the areas of software development and integration, systems engineering, integration strategies, security, testing and evaluation, maintenance and operations, and licensing are required to support customers in multiple functional mission areas. The availability of adequate personnel resources to ensure a smooth Program transition is also necessary. Anticipate that there will be approximately a 3-6 month transition period with the incumbent contractor Northrop Grumman Mission Systems.</p>
<p>RESPONSES TO RFI: All responses are limited to 5 pages (excluding the cover page), using a Microsoft Word format (i.e., 1 inch margins, Times New Roman 12 font). The responses should specifically describe the contractor's ability to meet the requirements outlined in the RFI and address the attached questions. Please include company's name, point of contact, address, phone number, DUNS number, CAGE Code, Tax ID and business size. Marketing Brochures will not be considered adequate information as a response to this RFI. All small businesses to include Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone, Women-Owned and Service Disabled are strongly encouraged to submit their responses.&nbsp; Questions and responses to the RFI must be submitted via email to the following Edward.Frank@disa.mil &amp; Randy.Dreyer@disa.mil by 2:00 pm (est.) on May 4, 2009.</p>
<p><br />DISCLAMER: This request for information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to this RFI or accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Contractors are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary or confidential will be treated accordingly. Information received in response to this RFI will not be returned. The purpose of this RFI is to gather potential sources that have the capabilities to provide the GCSS-J services for the Defense Information Systems Agency.</p>

Please note that this Synopsis provides ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation will be forthcoming.  All questions regarding this SYNOPSIS should be submitted in writing to the following E-Mail address:  Karen.S.Nelson@usace.army.mil.  <BR><BR>This Acquisition shall be competed as SMALL BUSINESS.  This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only.  A Small Business solicitation shall be issued for Design-Build Construction Services.  Services include Design-Build, Design-Bid-Build, and Construction services to meet the requirements for the following customers:  Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area.  <BR><BR>Contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs), with a base period plus four one-year option periods, for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build, and construction services with an estimated total workload value of $400 million for SWF and SWD customers.  <BR><BR>Any work executed under the SWD MATOC is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico).  However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered.  Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area if capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement.  <BR><BR>Scope of work includes, but is not limited to as follows: construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities.  The contracts are not only intended to execute new construction, design-build and design-bid-build, but to provide a timely response to remediation of real and personal property facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection.  <BR><BR>The Fort Worth District intends to award two or more contracts within the Small Business pool, with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $10 million and a minimum task order limitation of $3,000.  The minimum guarantee for the Small Business contract is $3,000 and it only applies to the base period. <BR><BR>In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the PDT will consider  1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement.   <BR><BR>Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).  The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors.  However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the five contractor pools.  All contracts will remain active unless or until 1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) contract expiration; 3) task order completion; 4) the contractual funding limit is reached; or 5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government.  Separate solicitations will be issued for the different contractor pools (Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB). <BR><BR>Any entity may submit proposal(s) who qualifies for the Statement of Work in the Solicitation.   The Awardees will make up the pool for each of the unrestricted and set-aside contract areas (HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business and unrestricted).  There must be two or more awards to create each of the HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted pool.  If there are not enough offerors in any one of the pools to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by- 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be awarded. <BR><BR>The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening.  All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government.  <BR><BR>The basic contract award is anticipated to consider pricing associated with professional labor rates.  These rates will not be subject to the Service Contract Act nor the Davis Bacon Act; General and Administrative rate; and Overhead rates.  After award, competition among the individual pool of contractors for project specific task order requirements is expected to result in fair and reasonable pricing.  However, the contractors pricing will primarily be associated with the quantity of professional labor based on the established contract unit price, competitive subcontractor pricing, and commercial items associated with a specific requirements.  The contractors proposal for a task order will include all the costs for the projectlump sum. There will not be a line item cost for subcontractors or commercial items on the bid schedule.  The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs.  The price proposal shall also (as applicable) include cost for:  All waste and excess material, Mobilization and close out for the total contract and each task order, Clean up, Safety (e.g., safety rails, safety nets, tethers, face/clothing protection, etc.), Traffic and work-site signs and barriers, Project management and supervision, Quality Control (QC), Office management and equipment, Depreciation of mobile office(s), Subcontractor profit, As-Built drawing, submittal, permits, license and other risks of doing business, and Site security. <BR><BR>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542, a Classification Code of Y111, and a business size standard of $33.5 million.  <BR><BR>This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>Title: RECOVERY -  Research and Development Support to the Recovery.gov Website


Synopsis: 

THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY****. ****THIS NOTICE IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS**** 


This award is a task order under an existing competed Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contract held by the IRS

American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Action Description:
The General Services Administration Central Office was authorized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to contract directly with MITRE to utilize the MITRE Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) Contract, TIRNO-99-D-00005.   Through the use of the contract, GSA has procured technical FFRDC systems and engineering support to the Recovery Board for activities that support the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act via a cost-plus-fixed fee task order.  The new initiative and uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price task order.  The initial focus of the effort is technical and management analysis and evaluations in support of the Recovery.gov program.   The scope of this work includes the provision of strategic and technical analysis, planning, requirements analysis, program and acquisition support, assessment and analysis support and audit advice and guidance from the FFRDC in support of the Recovery.gov initiative.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is an unprecedented effort to jumpstart our economy, create or save millions of jobs, and put a down payment on addressing long-neglected challenges so our country can thrive in the 21st century. The Recovery and Reinvestment Act is an extraordinary response to a crisis unlike any since the Great Depression.  With much at stake, the Act provides for unprecedented levels of transparency and accountability so that the public will be able to know how, when, and where tax dollars are being spent. Spearheaded by the Recovery, Accountability and Transparency Board (Recovery Board), this Act contains built-in measures to root out waste, inefficiency, and unnecessary spending.  The website, Recovery.gov, will be the main vehicle to provide each and every citizen with the ability to monitor the progress of the recovery.

The Recovery.gov initiative is critical to the Recovery Board's efforts to accomplish a greater level of oversight, accountability and transparency of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds and in showing where and how tax dollars are being spent.  To successfully accomplish this mission, the Recovery Board has an immediate need for trusted, independent and objective support from a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  The nature of the work requires a contractor that operates in the public interest with objectivity and independence, with full disclosure of its affairs to the government, and that is free from organizational conflicts of interest.  In order to discharge its responsibilities to the Recovery Board the organization will be afforded access, beyond that which is common to the normal contractual relationship, to Government and supplier data, including sensitive and proprietary data, and to employees and facilities.   Furthermore, the organization will maintain the confidentiality of this information through a trusted relationship with the Government.
