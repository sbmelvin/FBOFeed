<DESC>The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) is soliciting offers under Request for Proposal (RFP) Number VA786-16-R-0189 to perform the work to repair all cracks as well as remove and replace all damaged or rotted vigas along with supporting decorative support beams on the Maintenance Building (3001) and the two car garage (3002) at the Santa Fe National Cemetery, 501 Guadalupe Street, Santa Fe, NM. 87501. This acquisition is 100% set aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs). The NAICS Code is 236220; Size Standard is $36.5 Million. Offers received from concerns that are not SDVOSBs shall not be considered. SDVOSBs must be verified for ownership and control and listed in the Vendor Information Pages (VIP) at https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov prior to the due date for proposals. (See Provision 852.219-10 VA Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside.)

Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, and supplies necessary to perform the services entailed within the solicitation. COMPLETION TIME: Ninety (90) calendar days from the date of issuance of Notice to Proceed (NTP). Units and services shall be in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW), Technical Specifications, and terms and conditions contained in the solicitation. Please see the SOW entailed within the solicitation for a complete breakdown of all required deliverables for this requirement. 

PRE-BID SITE VISIT: Potential offerors are urged and expected to inspect and investigate the performance site by observation. Offerors are also urged to submit Requests for Information (RFI) and responses through the Contracting Office to satisfy their understanding of the work to be completed as well as all general, local, and technical conditions that may affect the cost and feasibility of the proposal. In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after award. 

There is only one organized site visit: Wednesday, May 12, 2016 at 11:00am. The meeting location of the site visit shall be located at the cemetery's Administration Building. The Administration Building is the first building you will see upon entering the cemetery's gates. The Cemetery Director and / or the Contracting Officer's Representative will be on site to answer any specific questions you may have pertaining to the performance of this requirement. If you are not able to be there at the scheduled time, you may do a self-guided visit at your convenience. There will be no Cemetery Personnel available at the time of your self-guided visit to show you around or answer any of your questions. You must call the COR to make sure he / she knows you are visiting the cemetery premises. Please do not ask the Cemetery Personnel any questions if you do a self-guided visit.

The Government intends to award a single, firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror whose offer is evaluated as the lowest-priced and technically acceptable (LPTA). The total price shall include all labor, travel expenses (if any), materials, overhead profit, insurance, and all other expenses necessary to deliver and install the required items. No additional sums will be payable on account of any escalations in the cost of materials, equipment, or labor, or because of the Contractor's failure to properly estimate or accurately predict the cost or difficulty of achieving the results required by this contract. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the LPTA offeror. 

The following factors listed in descending order of importance will be used to evaluate offers: (1) Price, (2) Technical Capability; and (3) Past Performance. Past Performance and Technical Capability when combined are not more important than Price. However, TECHNICAL CAPABILITY AND PAST PERFORMANCE MUST BOTH BE SATISFACTORY FOR THE OFFER TO BE CONSIDERED "TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE." SIMPLY HAVING THE LOWEST PRICED BID DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY CONSTITUTE GROUNDS FOR CONTRACT AWARD. 

Bonding:  The Government retains the right to ask for bonding (bid, performance, payment) if it is determined to be necessary to address Government concerns. In such cases, the Government will reimburse 100% of the bonding price. Failure to receive or qualify for bonding will result in removal from further consideration for award. The Experian Credit Report will be one of the tools used to determine if bonding should be required due to the business financial stress score/summary. The number of contracts outstanding will be another consideration in determining if bonding will be needed.  Failure to obtain bonding within a reasonable time will result in withdrawal of award and discussion with the next best offer.  If bonding is not required, the prime contractor is required to notify all subcontractors that there is no bonding on the contract.  Reference FAR 52.228-16 Performance and Payment Bonds - Other than construction.

Electronic solicitations will be available for download from Federal Business Opportunities http://www.FedBizOpps.gov on or around May 08, 2016. Responses to the solicitation are due by 4:00 p.m. EST on or about May 20, 2016. The question and answering period commences on May 08, 2016 and concludes on May 13, 2016 by 5:00 p.m. Email questions to anthony.hawley@va.gov. Offerors are advised that they are responsible for obtaining amendments to the solicitation which will be available at FedBizOpps.

All proposals must be submitted through the Department of Veterans Affairs - Electronic Management System (eCMS) Vendor Portal website in order to be considered for award.  https://www.vendorportal.ecms.va.gov. Please go to the VA eCMS Vendor Portal website at https://www.vendorportal.ecms.va.gov to register.  Once on the webpage, proceed to the Vendor Portal Login Section located on the far left side of the webpage and click on 'Request a user account' to register. In the event an Offeror is unable to submit a proposal through the Vendor Portal Domain prior to the proposal closing date, contact the VAAS helpdesk at 1-877-634-3739, or via email at VA.Acquisition.Systems@va.gov . Submission of proposals through email will not be accepted. Proposal transmission/uploads must be completed by the date/time specified.  Late or incomplete Proposals will not be considered. 
No telephone requests will be accepted. Any questions should be sent via email to anthony.hawley@va.gov.
