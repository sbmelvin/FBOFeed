<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations for an Electrochemical Impedence Measurement System with the following specifications: 1.) The electrochemical measurement system must be able to make impedance and DC polarization measurements on electrochemical   cells and cell stacks. 2.) The system shall include a potentiostat/galvanostat instrument and a frequency response analyzer (FRA) instrument. 3.) The system shall use Windowstm based control software to automate the operation of these instruments in a stand alone and combined mode operation.  4.) The system shall include a manufacturer’s warranty of two years for both the impedance system and electrochemical interface. 5.) The system shall include all computer interface cards and cables necessary to run the equipment.  6.) The frequency response analyzer shall meet the following specifications:    a. A current amplitude range of 0 to 60 mA    b. A voltage amplitude range of 5 mV to 3 V    c. A measurement accuracy of 0.1%, 0.1 degrees in impedance	 mode (over the range of 5 ohms to 100 kohms).    d. An impedance range of &lt;10 mohms to &gt;100 Mohms    e. A frequency range of 10 µHz to 32 MHz    f. A frequency accuracy of ±10ppm    g. Be able to perform automatic sweeps of frequency, amplitude or bias (liniear or logarithmic) in both impedance and gain/phase modes.    h. Have the ability to cancel out residual impedance of test leads and a normalize feature that will offset all future measurements against a test fixture and cabling frequency response.  7.) The potentiostat/galvanostat instrument shall meet the following specifications:    a. It shall be able to make measurements of electrochemical cells in 2, 3, or 4-terminal mode.    b. It shall be able to handle both floating and grounded connections	  c. It shall be able to apply a polarization voltage up to ±14V and a polarization current up to 2A. d.It shall be able to operate at a frequency range from 10 µHz to 32 MHz.    e. It shall be able to make true analog and digital DC sweeps in both potentiostatic and galvanostatic modes.	  f. It shall contain two digital voltmeters that allow simultaneous voltage and current measurements. Best Value Considerations In addition to the above specifications, best value consideration should be given to instruments that address the following considerations: 1.) True Windowstm control software with minimal keystrokes operations is preferred to software that runs as a DOS window. 2.) Instruments with frequency response analyzers are intrinsically faster and are preferred to those that use lock-in amplifiers.

<DESC>USAID/Cambodia invites qualified applicants, private voluntary organizations (PVOs), non-governmental organizations, not for profit organizations and universities with experience to submit applications for a cooperative agreement to implement activities to support vulnerable children and youth in Laos. For profit organizations may also submit applications, however, they will not be entitled to receive a fee or profit for this activity.  

The objective of this activity in Laos is to strengthen family and community capacity in responding to special physical, social, educational, and emotional needs of children in crisis such as orphans and children in special circumstances, e.g., children affected by natural disasters and children of opium addicts; mentally and/or physically disabled children, including blind children and children with hearing loss; and the social integration and vocational-technical training of older children and adolescents.  A three year cooperative agreement is expected to be awarded. Applications will be reviewed and award made based upon the criteria set forth in the RFA, which shall include an evaluation of an offeror’s past performance. 

The total estimated funding will be a maximum of US$1.0 million for a three year period with possibilities of extensions. USAID may award to one or more than one recipient if it is determined to be in USAID's interest to do so. As this is a results oriented activity, it is expected that funding will be based upon an agreeable workplan, verifiable achievement of required results and the availability of funds.  

All questions related to this notice must be addressed in writing, fax or email to the Agreement officer at the address stated above.  Specify the RFA number, and include your complete firm name, street address, phone and fax number and email address.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  The issuance date of the RFA is expected to be approximately fifteen (15) days from the date of publication of this notice.  The closing date for submission of proposals will be approximately forty five (45) days from the actual RFA issuance date, and will be specified in the RFA.   

The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Internet.  By exception, USAID can provide the solicitation on a 3.5" diskette.  Only in instances where Internet access or utilization of diskettes is not possible will a hard copy of the RFA be distributed upon request. Requestors must confirm to the Agreement Officer their inability to access the RFA via the Internet before they request a diskette or hard copy of the document.  

This CBD notice and the RFA, once issued, can be viewed and downloaded from the internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.   You are encouraged to access the solicitation via the Internet as this eliminates possible delays associated with mailing, in general, and particularly from overseas Missions.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, Sensors Directorate, Radio Frequency Technology Division, Reference Sensors & Receiver Applications Branch (AFRL/SNRP) solicits research proposals for the Antenna Advanced Inertial Reference for Enhanced Sensors (ANTARES) Program.  AFRL/SNRP intends to develop and test techniques that use data from inertial sensors or inertial measurement units (IMU’s) embedded in radio frequency (RF) apertures for motion compensation to improve the performance of two types of military aerospace vehicle sensor systems: (a) Ultra-Tightly Coupled (UTC) Global Positioning System (GPS)/Inertial Navigation Systems (INS’s); and (b) precision Electronic Support Measures (ESM) emitter detection and location systems.  System design, development, simulation, laboratory testing, and ground vehicle testing work will demonstrate and evaluate benefits of integrated inertial sensor and IMU antenna concepts for future active/passive sensing systems on aerospace vehicles, including cost-effective, feasible, and reliable techniques that enable increased navigation accuracy and jam resistance for UTC GPS/INS systems, and more accurate and timely location of emitters for ESM systems.  This is a multi-phase program, with one or more awards expected.  In the 12-month Phase-I, contractor(s) will perform requirements analyses, develop preliminary ANTARES design(s), perform simulations and analyses, and perform laboratory tests on critical design components.  In the 24-month Phase-IIA, contractor(s) will complete the design of and build, test, and evaluate Brassboard Technology Demonstrator(s) (BBTD(s)) of their ANTARES UTC GPS-INS system design(s) using contractor-laboratory-testing and contractor-manned-testing with government-furnished van test facilities.  In the parallel 24-month Phase-IIB, the contractor(s) will complete the design of and build, test, and evaluate BBTD(s) of their ANTARES embedded IMU/antenna ESM system design(s) using contractor-laboratory-testing and contractor-manned testing with government-furnished van test facilities.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE ORDER UNDER THE GSA SCHEDULE CONTRACT TO SYSTEMS PLANNING CORPORATION, Arlington, VA  22209 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to provide Dialogic Automated Notification System (Communicator) along with maintenance services for base year plus 4 additional option years. The Dialogic Communicator is compatible with every Agency within the Department of Homeland Security using the Dialogic System. In the event of a national emergency, it is possible for personnel of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Reporting Center to alert every agency within The Department of Homeland Security currently employing the Dialogic Communicator. Under this proposal, capabilities would exist for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement system to be utilized by other related federal agencies employing similar technology. In addition to the aforementioned the Notification System shall be capable of the following:  1)The ability to store contact information on as many individuals as desire,  2) Allow users to assign personal identification codes rather than automatically assigned by the system, 3) User identified fields for, among other purposes, dynamic creation of groups using specific look-up criteria, and 4) Ability to automatically poll roster members to call in at will for the purpose of updating telephone numbers.
The compatibility feature of the Dialogic System cannot be measured.  During a crisis this feature would prove to be invaluable.  With the events of September 11, heightened threat levels, the ever possibility of terrorists strikes against our nation, the ability to notify large numbers of key individuals in the shortest amount of time possible is critical.  
Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements or submit proposals. The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However all proposals received by 12:00 Noon EDT, April 21, 2003 will be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete with this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

This solicitation was originally issued with a requirement of up to 2,000 prisoners per day.  This solicitation was issued to provide a contract for the housing and detention of all U.S. Marshals detainees (plus some from Bureau of Prisons and Immigration and Naturalization Service) except those housed in governmental facilities (i.e.  Federal, State and Local jail facilities).  Since that time the need for jail space has increased.

The services are divided into four contract regions (San Diego Metro Area, Central Area, Valley Area, and Northern Area).  The majority of work will be in the San Diego metro area.  Work is priced based on the cost of performance for the San Diego area with additional cost adjustment factors for work required outside of the San Diego area.  Work may include any of the work items listed in the schedule as well as incidental related work required. The NAICS code for this procurement is 562998, “All Other Miscellaneous Waste Management Services.”  The small business size standard for NAICS 562998 is $6,000,000.00.  This competitive procurement will consist of one solicitation with the intent to award up to four Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts, though less than four IDIQ contracts may be awarded depending on the Government’s needs and the number and quality of offers received.  This requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis, however, if qualified small business firms submit reasonably priced offers, the Government intends to set aside at least one award for small business.  Firms responding to this announcement must show experience in sewer cleaning and inspection consistent with this description and the following evaluation factors.  Evaluation factors:  (1) past performance information, (2) technical experience, (3) management plan, (4) small business subcontracting effort, and (5) price.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors (1) through (4) are more important than Factor (5), however, the importance of price will increase if offerors are considered essentially equal in terms of non-price factors or if price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the technical superiority to the Government.  Price proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.219-4, “Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns,” which gives HUBZone firms a 10% price evaluation preference.  The source selection process will determine which offeror provides the best value to the Government considering price and non-price factors.  Award(s) will be made to the responsive, responsible offeror(s) whose proposals offer the best value to the Government.  The award(s) will consist of one 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods.  The minimum guarantee per contract is $5,000.00.  Work will be ordered on individual Task Orders placed against the contract(s).  If multiple awards are made from this solicitation, all successful offerors will be considered in the placement of individual task orders.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  

THE TECHNOLOGY:  This is an improved reclamation process for treating water-oil emulsions derived from producing or processing crude petroleum.  The process is useful for processing waste sludges, thus avoiding the complexities and cost of their disposal.  The process comprises heating the sludge to a temperature at or above 300 degrees C, and pressurizing the sludge at a pressure above the vapor pressure of water.  The emulsion is broken by containing it at temperature and pressure for a period of time sufficient to separate it into three phases.  The three phases are then separately withdrawn, preferably without any appreciable reduction of temperature and pressure and at least above a withdrawal temperature of about 300 degrees C and above the vapor pressure of water at the withdrawal temperature.

PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  

THE TECHNOLOGY:  A method to produce continuous thin films of ceramic oxide on polymer surfaces.  This is a novel thin film processing method that has been developed by adapting biomineralization strategies involving the use of surfaces derivatized with specific functional groups that initiate and control the deposition of minerals from aqueous solution.  This approach to thin film deposition may have advantages over conventional thin film processing methods in that densely packed, oriented crystallites can be deposited.  Initial work suggests that nucleation is initiated by interactions of ions or complexes with surface sites and further hydrolysis and condensation reactions. Surface-ion interactions may control crystallite orientation.  The process can be used to replace present sol-gel methods for forming thin films in many cases.  This method would be applicable to 'coatings', especially thin films for electronic and optical applications.  It can be developed and adapted to form magnetic films for recording tapes and disks -the magnetic iron oxide materials formed can be used for this application.  This is unique in that it combines particle formation and film formation into one step. It also has advantages in the resulting features of the iron oxide films.

THE TECHNOLOGY:  Tough, high-strength joints between SiC and SiC have been fabricated using displacement reactions between Si and Mo or Ti metal carbides.  The joints exhibit high-strength bonding to SiC and possess a desirable composite microstructure in the joint region due to the displacement reaction occurring between the Si and metal carbide.  This microstructure gives the joint region high strength and fracture toughness.  The formation of SiC during the displacement reaction facilitates the formation of the strong bond between the joint and the SiC.  The reaction products are SiC and metal silicides or metal carbo-silicides.  Joints have been made at temperatures above and below the melting point of Si (1410 C) so that either solid state or liquid-phase displacement reactions can be used.  Joints can be processed using blended powder compacts that are cold-pressed and then hot-pressed or can take  advantage of tape calendaring techniques to make a precursor layered tape that can be subsequently hot-pressed to form the joint.  For joining SiC to SiC there is no need for a graded joint region, but for joining dissimilar materials, a graded joint can be made using these techniques.  This is especially suited to the tape calendaring technique.  The formation of a graded joint can be accomplished by varying the relative amounts of starting reactants for the subsequent displacement reaction to promote the formation of both a microstructure and phase equilibria that varies throughout the thickness of the joint.  Obvious extensions of this technology are the fabrication of tough coatings for SiC or other materials. and making joints between SiC-based composites.

THE TECHNOLOGY:  Supported nickel metal catalysts can be used in aqueous processing systems for steam reforming, methanation, and hydrogenation., with activity over a range of temperatures from 200 C to 450 C.  However, these catalysts deactivate over time.  Stabilization of the nickel metal catalyst by the addition of ruthenium has been previously reported.  This invention extends the stabilization effect to silver and copper as well.

Both silver and copper addition to the nickel catalyst cause a stabilization of the catalyst activity which can be directly related to the reduced sintering of the nickel metal crystallites.  A silver or copper promoted nickel catalyst is more stable for aqueous phase processing than the nickel catalyst alone and is less expensive to fabricate (although less active) than a ruthenium promoted catalyst.  The catalyst has been used for aqueous phase, low-temperature gasification and should be useful in various aqueous phase hydrogenation systems as well.  The stabilizing effect appears to be related to a stabilization of the nickel metal crystallites, maintaining a well-dispersed catalytic surface.

THE TECHNOLOGY:  Since the discovery that titanium dioxide (titania) can act as a photocatalyst for the splitting of water, the substance has attracted the attention of scientists.  Titanium dioxide, however, exhibits two principal physical limitations. First, titanium dioxide absorbs light at energies greater than 3.2 eV; well outside the most intense region of the ambient solar spectrum (centered at about 2.6 eV).  And second, since titanium dioxide functions as a heterogeneous catalyst, catalytic activity is limited by surface area.

Mesoporous nanocrystalline titanium dioxide heterojunction materials as described here are a surprising new class of materials that overcome the principal limitation of zirconium oxide stabilized mesoporous nanocrystalline titanium dioxide.

THE TECHNOLOGY:  We have discovered a simple and novel method of preparing highly active and stable catalysts, which may be advantageously used in aqueous hydroprocessing reactions.  Essentially, we have discovered how to produce a metal oxide supported metal catalyst, that is itself supported on a high surface area granular carbon support.  In this case the metal oxide supported metal catalyst is applied to the carbon in an eggshell manner, thereby avoiding the severe mass transport limitations.  The metal oxide precursor and optionally the catalytic metal precursor are added to the carbon support as a hydrated suspension, that as a consequence of its size, only can go into the larger pores of the carbon.  With careful control of the preparative conditions, it is possible to prepare a catalyst where virtually all of the catalytic metal is associated with the metal oxide layer, which is in turn found predominately on the outside surfaces and macropores of the carbon.  The high surface area carbon surface in effect acts as a textural promoter for the metal oxide coatings and helps to maintain the surface area of the oxide coating and high dispersion of the catalytic metal.

THE TECHNOLOGY:  A new process concept for the production of polyols, especially ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and glycerol.  This concept process is a refinement of the generally understood two-stage process of sugar conversion to polyols.  In the conventional process, aqueous solutions of any of the aldose sugars can be catalytically hydrogenated to a sugar alcohol in the first step, and then the product of the first step is catalytically hydrocracked in a second step to produce the polyol products.  The conventional process involves fixed beds of supported nickel metals catalyst in continuous flow reactors.  The same catalyst is used in both reactors and the differentiating factor between the two reactor beds is the processing temp.  The concept is that the better route of lactose conversion to polyols will not pass through a lactitol intermediate but will require a pretreatment hydrolysis of the lactose to glucose and galactose.  The glucose and galactose can then be hydrogenated to sorbitol and dulcitol, respectively, and then hydrocracked to polyols in the conventional way.  We have shown that galactose is also amenable to hydrogenation to dulcitol in high yield.  Dulcitol, similar to sorbitol, should then be able to be hydrocracked to the desired polyol products.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  

THE TECHNOLOGY:  The present invention covers the use of supercritical fluids (principally supercritical carbon dioxide and small amounts of water) to etch the interior surfaces of aerogel materials.  Subsequent analyses indicate that this treatment results in an increase in the surface area and a simplification of the pore structure distribution of the aerogel materials.  Average pore diameter increases and bottleneck pore diameter increases.  Silanation of the materials using supercritical carbon dioxide after hydroetching resulted in a 70-130% weight increase, indicating that the aerogels can now be effectively functionalized.  This functionalization indicates that the potential exists to produce low-cost aerogel materials with loading capacities similar or superior to much more expensive  mesoporous ceramics.  US and foreign patents pending.  NOTE:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 90 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology (LMCB) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with MJ Research Inc., 5350 Capital Court, Suite #102, Reno, NV  89502 for the purchase of a   DNA Engine Opticon2 System.   The LMCB investigates basic cellular processes of homeostasis, growth, division and differentiation, with an emphasis on the genetic and molecular biology of chromosomes and the cell nucleus. One of the LMCB’s projects involves the identification and characterization of interactions of chromosomal proteins and genes and the effects of these interactions on gene expression. The project analyzes proteins involved in organization of the genome into higher-order structures, proteins involved in chromatin reorganization and their effects on genome wide gene expression and maintenance of genomic integrity.  This research requires a continuous fluorescence detection system that utilizes a Peltier thermal cycler with multi-sensor/multi-zone temperature control technology, thermal accuracy of ±0.3&#730;C, well-to-well uniformity of ±0.4&#730;C, accommodating 96 samples, in plate or strip tube format, with optional programming of a thermal gradient of up to 24&#730;C, across the 96-well sample block, yielding less than ±0.4&#730;C variation from the predicted temperature. These performance specifications, which are fulfilled by the DNA Engine Peltier thermal cycler manufactured by MJ Research, are necessary for efficient optimization of PCR conditions for specific primer pairs and experimental compatibility with two identical thermal cyclers currently present in the laboratory. The research also requires a continuous fluorescence detection system that excites fluorescent dyes with absorption spectra in the 450 to 505 nm range, and optimized for dyes with emission spectra in the first channel of 533/20 nm range, and in the second channel 540-700 nm range. Especially important is the capability to excite samples sequentially with 96 LEDs, and detect each signal via two photomultiplier tubes (PMT) individually, without any moving parts, in order to ensure robustness of data collection. The DNA Engine Opticon2 System is the only piece of equipment known to the NCI Research that meets the above requirements.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet all of the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on April 17, 2003.  All question must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendors responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 334516

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of  Amendment 3 to the combined synopsis/solicitation NAMA-03-Q-0007 is to provide the following question and answer received on March 31, 2003. March 31, 2003 was the cut-off date for all questions. 

Question:

  Referring to:
 ...'conversion of each image to either: CLIN 0001AA 1024x768 24-bit image to be viewed on a standard RGB monitor; or CLIN 0001AB     800x600 24-bit image to be viewed on a standard RGB monitor',

It appears that the RFQ is requesting an output digital image quality (resolution and color depth) that is not supported in the original analog videodisc format, which has a maximum of 400 lines of horizontal resolution.  Given that the above analysis is correct (please advise if not), the pixel interpolation necessary to create the 'falsely' higher resolution digital image could instead be accomplished by the viewer station, allowing for the digital image to be captured at an image quality equal to the original analog source, saving critical storage space and network bandwidth for transfer and delivery.  Also, the NARA furnish Sony LDP -2000 videodisc player has an output resolution of 360 lines.

Answer:

NARA requires 800 x 600 pixel images (or the appropriate pixel array, with the long dimension not to exceed 800 pixels and maintaining the original aspect ratio) from the analog videodiscs.  File interpolation can be done during the digital capture step or as a post-capture interpolation using image processing software.  All equipment, software, processing algorithms, and image processing procedures should be optimized (as well as cited in the proposal) to provide the best quality images at the requested image dimensions.

This amendment also corrects the numbering of Amendment 1 to Amendment 2 in the posting dated March 28, 2003.

This amendment extends the proposal due to April 16, 2003, 4:00pm Eastern Daylight Time.

                                     END AMENDMENT NO. 3

<DESC>Modification:  This solicitation is hereby reopened. All previously submitted proposals are still valid.  The due date for new proposals is extended to 3:00 PM EST, April 22, 2003.  The solicitation is hereby modified to allow for multiple awards. 

Statement of Needs:

Overview:

This is a total small business set-aside.  For this procurement a company is considered small if it has gross average annual sales for the proceeding three years of less than $6.0 million.  All responsible small businesses may submit an offer that will be considered.  The NAICS code for this action is 541430, Graphic Design Services, Size Standard $6.0 Million.  The Office of Personnel Management requires the services of a commercial vendor to provide design (consistent with OPM's established corporate image) for a wide range of products (i.e.: posters, charts, banners, flyers, pamphlets, books, etc...).  The vendor must be available/reachable 24/7.  Some orders may also require production of banners for indoor/outdoor use (1'x 10'- 4'x25') output and mounting of charts and posters on foam core (or equal), up to 3'x4', conversion of printing files for use on the Internet, and miscellaneous other graphic arts services.  This procurement will lead to the award of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with a period of performance of 1 year from the date of award.


Schedule:

Approximately 50% of the orders will be placed in the afternoon to late evening with delivery required by 8 am of the next day, 30% will require delivery within 2-3 days and the remaining 20% will be for 5 days or more.

If delivery is not made as required the order may no longer be required, and therefore the Government will render no payment.  If the product is still required only normal charges will be paid for the work performed (no surcharges).  Additionally, if the product does not match the approved proofs or furnished directions the Government reserves the right to reject the order and render no payment.

Contacts:

The vendor must provide contact names and phone numbers, as many orders will be placed late in the day or after normal business hours.

Pickup & Deliveries:
 
Contractor will pickup and deliver all materials to the Office of Personnel Management.  When possible government furnished material and deliverables will be transmitted electronically via email, to an FTP site, or as mutually agreed.

Frequency of Orders:

OPM is unable to predict with any certainty the frequency or orders, generally 1 - 4 orders will be placed each month.  Orders will be placed via telephone accompanied with a task order from the Publications Services Division.

Average number of orders per month will be 2.  Our estimate of the types of orders that will be placed is as follows:

10 invitations/cards (OPM to print orders that require printing/silk screening versus electronic production of small quantities which are to be produced on this contract) 1 color, stock furnished.

4 posters (OPM to print orders that require printing versus electronic production of small quantities which are to be produced on this contract), 2 - 4 colors, gloss finish stock, mounted on foam core, 2 - 10 copies for electronic production.

6 orders for charts/graphs, averaging 5 - 10 products per order, 2 - 4 colors, matte finish stock, mounted on foam core, 3' x 4'.

2 books, 48 - 250 pages (OPM to print), 2 - 4 colors.

6 banners, some with 2 or more products with the same or different images, 4-color process.

4 pamphlets, 4 - 16 pages (OPM to print), 2 - 4 colors.

2 orders requiring conversion of files for use on the Internet, these products will normally be the books or pamphlets produced under this contract.


Government Furnished Material:

When the Government deems it possible all materials will be furnished to the vendor electronically.  Otherwise, the vendor must pickup the GFM from the Office of Personnel Management or a mutually agreed upon location.


Samples:

When submitting your bid please provide samples of no less than 5 previous products designed by your company.


Proposal Preparation Requirements:

In submitting an offer for this project, the contractor must provide:

Technical Proposal (Original and two copies)
Resumes of key personnel
A description and samples of similar work performed in the last 24 months
Customer references including names and telephone numbers of company contacts
Timeline for completion of tasks and technical plan describing how work would be accomplished.
Minimum level of work/reimbursement needed to perform under this contract.
Price per hour for design work.
Price to produce products listed under Frequency of Orders (samples of these products are available for viewing at OPM in Room 5H35).

Vendor must address the following issues in their proposal:

Means of providing after hours service and contact information.

Evaluation:

A blanket purchase agreement will be established with the offeror OPM determines offers the best value.  Award from this solicitation will be made on a “best value” basis. In making that determination, selecting the successful offeror, the technical factors bear significantly more importance than cost, but cost could be the deciding factor if there are no essential technical differences among the most highly rated offers.


Technical Evaluation:

Technical proposals will be evaluated against the following criteria. They are listed in descending order of importance:

Experience/ education of key personnel 
Quality of past performance based on input from references
Quality and relevance of plan for accomplishing work and other relevant information
Experience in performing similar projects



Cost Evaluation:

The OPM will evaluate the estimated prices you have proposed for the jobs listed in the “Frequency of Orders” section of the request for quotations in addition to the price per hour you have proposed for design work.  For evaluation purposes, we estimate there will be 775 design hours of service.

The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions, so initial offers should be on terms most favorable to the Government. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest price offeror.

<DESC>SSA-RFQ-03-0108 Amendment Three - The purpose of this amendment is to provide questions and answers regarding the requirement for lease of vehicles.

Question #1: When was the current Town Car and Grand Marquis acquired and what is the current mileage for each?

Response: The Town Car has 51,323 and was received on 4/11/02. The Marquis has 16,897 and was received on 4/24/02. 

Question #2: If the vehicles are going to be garaged at SSA Baltimore why have District of Columbia tags been requested? DC tax, title and tags are more expensive than Maryland. Can the cost of same be added to the very first lease invoice?

Response: The vehicles will be garaged but the solicitation did not say that they would be garaged at SSA Baltimore.  Although the acquisition is being conducted from our Baltimore office the duty station for the persons using the vehicles is Washington D.C.   The contractor may prorate the tax, title and tag costs over the life of the agreement or may indicate a separate line item for these costs for the base year and Option Year II, when the replacement vehicles are required. 

Question #3: If the Town Car receives 35,500 or more miles per year will SSA accept replacement of the vehicle each year as long as the cost of same is clearly identified?

Response: The contractor may elect to replace the Town Car sooner than the end of option year I as required by the solicitation.  However, such replacement shall be at no additional cost to the government.

<DESC>The Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) Joint Program Office intends to issue a production contract to procure the next generation GPS Anti-Jam Antenna System.  The Advanced Development Antenna Production (ADAP) system will consist of an electronics control unit referred to as a Digital Antenna Electronics (DAE), an antenna referred to as a Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA) and a Ground Plane Assembly (GPA). The GPA is an integrated unit consisting of a DAE, CRPA, and a Ground Plane Enclosure (GPE) that provides a weatherproof enclosure for the DAE and a ground plane for the CRPA (for mounting on a ship's mast).  It is anticipated that an RFP will be released in 4Q FY03. Source selection will be based on written proposals for the DAE, CRPA and GPA and a technical sample for the DAE and CRPA. The DAE and CRPA technical sample will be evaluated by the government beginning in 1Q FY04 to assess the merits of the bidders design and the risk of transitioning the technical sample to a production system that meets or exceeds all threshold requirements of the system. Contract award is projected for 2Q FY04 with deliveries 12 months after receipt of order. It is anticipated that fifteen DAE, fifteen CRPA and 9 GPA (with DAE and CRPA) First Articles will be procured initially in FY 05. Subsequently, there will be four one-year production options planned which will bring the total number of systems to approximately 1600 DAEs, 1300 CRPAs and 300 Ground Plane Enclosures. The DAE shall incorporate advanced digital signal processing techniques to provide enhanced interference suppression simultaneously in the Global Positioning System (GPS) L1 (1575.42 MHz) and L2 (1227.60 MHz) frequency bands.  It shall be capable of autonomously steering a single antenna beam with increased gain in a direction normal to the plane of the CRPA in the hemisphere above the CRPA under static conditions to aid in initial GPS receiver signal acquisition. The DAE shall be fully compatible with the proposed GPS Modernization M-Code signal. It shall be capable of operating with the CRPA, current seven element GAS-1 CRPA Line Replacement Unit (LRU) and other legacy CRPAs, including the CRPA-2. Primary objectives for the DAE are to maintain the AE-1 and GAS-1 AE form factor and interfaces and require less than 50 watts prime power.  The First Article DAE units can exceed the size and power objectives by approximately 25%.  The bidder shall develop a pre-planned product improvement, if required, to meet DAE size and power objectives for any exercised production options subsequent to First Article deliveries. The CRPA shall have 7 effective elements and maintain the GAS-1 CRPA form factor. It must also meet or exceed current GAS-1 CRPA requirements over the 24 MHz bandwidths centered on L1 and L2 and be fully compatible with the proposed M-code signal when mounted on the GPA or GAS-1 specification ground plane. The GPA shall meet environmental and electromagnetic interference requirements for Navy ship installations.  The GPE can be build-to-print or a modification of an operationally-proven Navy design using Government Furnished Information (GFI). Interested parties are invited to submit a Statement Of Capability (SOC). The SOC shall not exceed ten pages. Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration on each of the following qualifications: (1) Experience: An outline of (a) specific research and development and/or production contracts previously performed or being performed and any in-house research and development efforts that relate to the design, fabrication, testing, and production of the DAE, CRPA, and GPA capability and (b) capability to produce, test, and deliver ADAP units at the quantities and schedule indicated above, (2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of key technical and management personnel who may be assigned to this program, (3) Facilities: Availability and description of laboratory, test, and production facilities required to develop, produce, and test First Articles and subsequent ADAP units at the quantities and schedule indicated above, (4) Level of personnel and facility security clearance for the generation, discussion, and storage of secure data and documents (It is anticipated that clearance to the SECRET level will be required for the performance of ADAP effort), and (5) Any other specific information that would enhance our evaluation. The SOC is response date is posted above.  The government will use this SOC to determine if there is sufficient interest in the marketplace from qualified sources. The Government does not intend to award any contract as a result of, or pay any costs associated with, submittal of information solicited herein. The SOC and all related communications that contain proprietary information should be marked as such. An Industry Day is planned for June 3-4 to facilitate potential offerers understanding of the government's requirements and to receive potential offerers feedback on the government's approach to this solicitation. A separate FedBizOpps will announce this meeting. An Ombudsman, Dr. David Ganger, at (310) 363-0588, has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Program Director or Contracting Officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Small Business companies are encouraged to participate. See Note 26.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for solicitation will not receive a response.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only, and in no way obligates the Government in an award of any contract.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking commercial technology solutions to requirements associated with response to the threat of proliferation of chemical weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  This synopsis seeks to identify qualified sources from Government or Industry for the following requirements:

1.  Chemical Agent Sample Collection.  Methods and containers for the safe transport of samples with minimal sample degradation over an extended period of time are needed.  Containers must be lightweight, man portable, rugged and able to withstand temperature extremes while maintaining sample integrity. New sampling devices and the means to manipulate and safely transport potentially contaminated samples/materials with minimal degradation of sample integrity will enable later forensic analysis of chemical materials for attribution. Material incompatibilities, limits of use and appropriate instructions for use are required. 

2.  Chemical Agent Detection.  State of the art detection of chemical agents (to include toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) and toxic industrial materials (TIMs)) in a variety of backgrounds including air, water and surface materials are desired.  Detection may be accomplished through fieldable point or standoff detectors.  Systems should be able to identify at least the specific class of agents (e.g., nerve agents, blister agents) if not the actual agents themselves.  Detectors that can function in the presence of organics and other potential interferents are desirable. False negative rates and false positive rates must be minimized.  Detection should be rapid, reliable and easy to use.  Instruments should be man portable, ruggedized, lightweight and have low power requirements.  Methods for intrusive and non-intrusive detection agents in liquid, vapor and dry states will be considered. Responses should also address the capability to provide hands-on training and appropriate manuals for system operation.  

3.  Chemical Agent Identification.   Identification of specific chemical agents, as well as several chemical agents simultaneously, is desired. Other parameters and criteria for identifiers are the same as those described for detectors.  Again, technologies should function effectively in the presence of interferents. Instruments should be man portable, ruggedized, lightweight and have low power requirements.  Responses should also address capability to provide hands-on training and appropriate manuals for systems operations.  

4.  Individual Protection.  Individual chemical protection may include new clothing materials, prophylaxes, masks, respiratory systems, cooling suits, isolation systems, etc.   

5.  Decontamination.  Lightweight, rapid chemical decontamination methods for personnel, equipment (including sensitive equipment) and vehicles are examples of decontamination items that are desired.   

6.   Rapid Destruction of Chemical Materials.  Rapid destruction methods that either neutralize specific chemicals or render them useless (i.e., can no longer be used in a specific product formulation) are of interest, including methods for bulk agents.  Methods should be able to destroy even the most concentrated forms of chemical materials in the presence and absence of contaminating organic species. All forms of deactivation and delivery methods will be considered.

Proposed performance characteristics for this requirement are: 1) Destruction efficiency measured in percent neutralization for chemical agent efficacy or the degree of irreversibility for technologies that render target chemicals useless; 2) Ease of use. Minimal preparation time.  Minimal exposure of user to chemical material.  Autonomous use is preferred.  Ease of handling, transportation and storage. 3) Speed of neutralization or inactivation (faster is better); 4) Mass ratio of inactivating agent or equipment to chemical being neutralized or rendered useless (i.e. lowest mass of inactivating agent/equipment that services the greatest mass of target chemical); 5) Stability and shelf life (greater stability and longer shelf life is better); 6) Destruction method is least hazardous to user.   

7.  Facility Decommissioning.  Buildings and various pieces of equipment (including production, weaponization and storage equipment) need to be decommissioned.  Rapid methods which render equipment and infrastructure unusable and minimize potential contamination of the surrounding environs are desired.  Because these buildings and equipment will no longer be used, destruction methods that are easy to use and user friendly are desired. 
Sources having the capability to provide technologies addressing any or all of these requirements are invited to submit white papers  (6-10 pages maximum); white papers need to include sufficient technical information for a review panel to assess the scientific validity of the submitted technology.  Separate white papers are requested for responses addressing more than one of the seven requirements, or for submission of multiple technologies for the same requirement.  Responses should include a cost estimate ROM (rough order of magnitude) and the capability to participate in a concept demonstration by March 2006.   Documents shall be provided in electronic form (Microsoft WORD, EXCEL, or PowerPoint) to the contract specialist at DTRA, Attn:  ALT/ Cynthia Sanders, via e-mail: Cynthia.Sanders@dtra.mil no later than 30 April 2003; include 'AIC# TDS030000684' in the subject line of all email correspondence.  Company information should include qualifications and experience in work of this nature, point of contact, business size and disadvantaged, 8(a) or HUBZone.  Any information submitted in response to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this Sources Sought.  This announcement in no way obligates the Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise make a contract award.

<SUBJECT>V -- Sole source charter of Manned Submersible
<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to contract with, on a sole
source basis, Delta Oceanographics, for used of a manned submersible.
The submersible will be used for research on such matters as determining
effect of fishing gear on groundfish habitat, and the distribution and
ecology of coral.  Work is anticipated in Oregon and Alaska, and other
west coast  waters.  The total system shall include the submersible,
support ship, launch and retreival system, crew, and scientific
laboratory space.  The period of performance is expected to be three
years.  The Government intends to negotiate solely with this contractor
because of the need for scientific continuity on ongoing projects.
Further, if a vessel other than the Delta were to be used, the
government would have to make extensive and costly changes in scientific
protocols and procedures, and purchase substantial quantities of

<SUBJECT>R -- A-76 Express Review Study for Clerical Support Services
<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service - Florida State Office (NRCS-FLSO) intends to conduct a cost comparison in accordance with OMB-approved USDA Express Review Study procedures. The study is for clerical support functions in Lake City, FL, NAICS Code 561410 (NRCS-03-FL-03). Major clerical support tasks include general office support functions (telephone, reception, typing, filing, copying, mail, faxing, mail distribution), processing training and travel requests, time keeping, maintain office bulletin board, and basic clerical research.   The USDA Express Review process is based on the assumption that the commercial activity under study is regularly performed under contract by commercial activities at firm fixed prices and that existing Federal contracts can be used, with only minor modification, to level and define the scope of the competition and avoid the need to develop a new PWS or a formal solicitation. NRCS-FLSO is seeking to locate commercial businesses that have experience and also have current government contracts for clerical support services. All interested and capable parties that have expertise in clerical support services should respond VIA E-MAIL to the Contracting Officer lynn.merrill@fl.usda.gov with a list of their 1) contract number 2) Federal Agency name and point of contact 3) the firm fixed price of each contract 4) the period of performance   covered and 5) the size and business status. NOTE: This is NOT A SOLICITATION or request for proposals; however, depending on the results of the streamlined cost comparison, a solicitation may be issued at a later date. Any questions should be submitted via EMAIL ONLY (no phone calls please) to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Lynn Merrill.

Contractor shall furnish all materials, transportation/shipping to restore one 12ft KC-135 Model Aircraft to new condition, Re-engine one 8ft KC-135 aircraft and install mounting base, and design and build one interior display 8ft scale KC-135.


Model #1:  This model is an existing 12’ wingspan, exterior scale model aircraft of a KC135r. This model was built by a contractor several years ago for display at the Main Gate of MacDill AFB.  Contractor shall repair existing viewed damage to Model #1 aircraft to a “New” condition. Repairs shall include, but not limited to repainting with automotive grade paints and application of new automotive grade graphics, pick-up and delivery. Contractor shall arrange with the designated representative of the USAF, the necessary model detailing and markings for the model. 

Model #2:  This model is an existing 8’wingspan, wind tunnel testing model of a full size KC135r. Contractor shall design and build an appropriate mounting base being attached to bottom of existing 2 mounting bolts protruding thru the bottom of existing model fuselage. Contractor shall coordinate with USAF and provide the dimensions required for USAF to design and built a support pedestal for the final exterior mounting location. Contractor shall endeavor to ensure that model is water tight, and as structurally sound as possible within the parameters specified above. Only modification to this existing model is to replace existing engines with appropriate engines as directed by USAF. No horizontal radio antenna is to be mounted on the existing rudder assembly. Existing model lighting in wingtips and other areas of model are to be removed and/or disabled, and locations of existing lighting to be filled and painted.

<DESC>(i)	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
(ii)	Solicitation #RFQ-17-03-050
(iii)	The Solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular #13.
(iv)	Not set aside.
(v)	Line Item #1.  Furnish and Install Multi-line Dispatch Console, 1 Each
(vi)	General:  The contractor shall furnish and install a fully-functional multi-line remote control dispatch console system for use by the INYO NATIONAL FOREST in a two-way mobile radio system—including, but not limited to, all equipment, material, parts, labor, and site-specific software programming.  The dispatch console system shall be comprised of multiple operator positions sharing a common electronics package and shall provide all the necessary functions to operate conventional FM two-way radio base or repeater stations and provide control and/or communications of paging systems, alarms, devices and other ancillary equipment.
1.	Equipment shall be new and currently in production.
2.	The system described shall be wired for four Communications Control Operator Positions.
3.	The Communications Control Center Console shall utilize touch screen color monitor and mouse control technology for the user interface.
4.	The system shall be wired to control seventeen base station radios, but be equipped for thirty-two radios.
5.	The system shall be wired to control six analog loop-start phone lines, but be equipped for twelve lines.
6.	The only parts required to expand from the equipped capacity to the wired capacity shall be plug in cards, wiring and operator positions.  
7.	Each position will require a dual monitor card and two 18.1” or larger LCD Touch screens--one for radio operation and one for telephone. 
8.	The system shall employ a 256 port non-blocking Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) digital audio switch.  
9.	Consoles shall be capable of displaying a repeater/tone name upon receiving an ASCII message.  To identify the repeater in use a CTCSS to ASCII decoder will be used (supplied by the Forest).  This ASCII signature must be translated to the appropriate ASCII display on the console.  This will take the form of the repeater name blinking on one of the buttons on the display.
10.	The system shall be fully user programmable as regards to system, Operator Position, base station, and user interface configuration.  All aspects of the configuration shall be available to local customer service personnel.  All configuration settings shall be available through any operator position without the need for PROM replacement or the use of an external PC (personal computer).  This includes both screen programming features and radio interface settings.  Separate programming from a central electronics unit will not be acceptable. The system shall be capable of accepting configuration changes made from an off-site personal computer. 
11.	In order to take advantage of future requirements, the software shall be written in a language compatible with a Microsoft networked operating system application.  The operating system environment will allow us to perform multi-tasking with other programs that are suitable to run with a real time system such as this dispatch communications program.  
12.	The system must be able to employ digital audio from the microphone to the control lines in order to insure maximum resistance to analog interference and the highest quality audio.  The interface between the console positions and the common electronics shall be T1 requiring only two pairs of wires.  It shall be possible to use a dedicated cable, in-house category 5 LAN cable, or existing telephone wiring to connect an operator position to the common electronics.  The operator positions shall be DC isolated from the common electronics to eliminate ground loops. 
13.	E911 telephone capability may be implemented in the future by simply adding telephone hardware to the existing common equipment.  
14.	The contractor shall provide free operator position and system card software updates for the life of the system.  These updates shall include but not be limited to all software bug fixes, configuration enhancement, and features added to the software.  The updates shall also include all software features added to meet newer customer requirements.  These new features shall be capable of being activated free of charge with a simple configuration change at Inyo National Forest's discretion.
