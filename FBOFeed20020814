<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a sole source Request for Proposal (RFP) for the follow-on Phase II, the Implementation Phase (Design, Fabrication and Testing), of the Integrated System Test of an Airbreathing Rocket Engine Demonstrator Project. In order to support the NASA/MSFC 3rd Generation goal of creating a safe, affordable highway through the air and into space, the Advanced Space Transportation Program Office is procuring the second and final phase of the development of a flight-like, rocket-based combined-cycle (RBCC) engine system ground testbed to demonstrate RBCC engine system operation for the air-augmented rocket, ramjet, and scramjet modes. This engine system provides a means of validating predictive capabilities, including vehicle system analysis models, evaluating the engine system operating characteristics, demonstrating flight-like engine system design and fabrication techniques, and can serve as a testbed for candidate technologies. Phase I, the Conceptual and Requirements Definition Phase, of the engine system development is currently being performed and includes the development of the engine system conceptual design, definition of the system requirements, and subscale component testing to provide early data for high risk components, culminating in a System Requirements Review. Phase II of the engine system development will include the preliminary and critical design reviews, fabrication, and ground testing of the engine system in 2006.   NASA/MSFC intends to purchase this research and development effort from the Rocket Based Combined Cycle Consortium (RBC3), composed of The Boeing Company/Rocketdyne Division, Aerojet General Corporation, and United Technologies/Pratt& Whitney, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. RBC3 is the contractor currently performing the Phase I effort of the project for which this acquisition is a follow-on. Prior to the Phase I effort, each of these companies performing under individual contracts provided RBCC engine system concept research which formed the research basis for this engine demonstrator project. NASA's investment in these research efforts to date total approximately $50 million. The companies are the only known sources capable of advancing the RBCC engine concept to the engine system level demonstration, and have formed a consortium to combine their experience and unique capabilities that are required for the continued advancement of RBCC propulsion system technology.  Subcontracting opportunities exist during this phase of the project.  Small businesses, including disadvantaged, woman-owned, Hubzone, veteran-owned, and historically black colleges and universities, that are interested in subcontracting opportunities for this effort may provide their company information to the point of contact listed for this synopsis.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 29, 2002. See Note 25. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. See note 22.	An Ombudsman has been appointed, See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Composite Bolt Torquing Research - Torque Limits in Composite Task.  The torque limits task in composites is to develop an empirical approach for determining the torque limit values applied to bolts when metallic mechanical fasteners are utilized in joining composite materials.  This will initiate the procedure for defining torque limits in various composite materials, as there is not a standard procedure for torquing composite materials similar to torque standards for metallic materials.	  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/MSFC intends to purchase Composite Bolt Torquing Research - Torque Limits in Composite Task, only from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, 600 S Clyde Morris Blvd, Daytona Beach, FL, 32114-3900.  Dr. Yi Zhao at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University developed a methodology for defining the torque limits for fasteners in composites and is validating these methodologies for potential utilization in Next Generation Launch vehicles. Currently there is not a standard procedure for torquing composite materials similar to torque standards for metallic materials.  Dr. Zhao developed the methodology for determining thru-the-thickness modulus of elasticity and validating using one material.  The generation of statistically valid empirical results requires repeating the same procedure developed by Dr. Zhao.	   Dr.Zhao has extensive experience in analyzing composite material investigating torque limits in composites and there are no other known researchers investigating torque limits in composites.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 5, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	Responses received after September 5, 2002, or without the required information, will be considered nonresponsive to this solicitation and will not be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All sources determined to be responsible after review of submitted capabilities/qualifications may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NA Enhanced Bandwidth Efficient Modem (E-BEM).  Solicitation Number DAAB07-02-R-A764, a competitive solicitation, will be issued that will result in an eight (8) year Firm-fixed Price (FFP) and Time and Material (T&M),  IDIQ contract. This contract will provi de for the purchase of modems, spares, training and maintenance.  The EBEM must be available for Teleports Generation One- Initial Operational Capability 2 (GEN 1 IOC 2) in FY 04, and be available to support the second site of Gapfiller at Wahiawa, Hawaii  by 1st QTR FY 05. Currently there are a number of commercially available modems that meet the various requirements of E-BEM.  However, there is no single modem in a single package  that meets all the E-BEM requirements.  Therefore, a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) effort is required to repackage these various commercial capabilities into a single package and conduct a First Article Test (FAT) to validate the repackaging effort. The E-BEM is a commercial state-of-the-art modem that is capable of interfacing with military baseband systems that operate over military Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS), Wideband Gapfiller System (WGS)) and commercial satellite communicatio ns systems.  These systems are available to the National Command Authority and Department of Defense (DoD) and are integral components of the Global Information Systems Network (DISN).  The E-BEM will provide and support data transmission characteristics t hat allow the deployed Warfighter to gain access to critical DISN services such as intelligence data, secure voice, data and video as well as command and control information.  The E-BEM contract will also provide a tactical variant that will be used on Nav y ships with potential use for ground mobile users of satellite communications.  The E-BEM will be a MIL-STD-188-165A compliant DoD communications modem; its design will incorporate leading edge commercial technologies that proliferate Warfighter communica tions.  It is intended that the E-BEM become the modem standard of strategic fixed stations, Navy ships and Teleport WGS sites.  The modem will satisfy user requirements by efficiently increasing satellite communications through-put, this increase will meet the de mands required by Teleport and WGS sites.  The modem interfaces shall support legacy MIL-STD-188-164 Terminal Types A and B that are compliant with open systems standards such as Level 5 of the Defense Information Infrastructure Framework for Information M anagement (TAFIM), Joint Technical Architecture (JTA), and DoD Directive 5200.28 Security Requirements for ADP systems. The design capabilities of these modems will take advantage of current and future technologies, while continuing to ensure backward compatibility with legacy OM-73 and other Government owned COTS Binary Phase Shift Key (BPSK), Quad Phase Shift Key (QPSK), Offset Quad Phase Shift Key (OQPSK), and INTELSAT compatible Eight (8)- Phase Shift Key modems.  The E-BEM Modem will incorporate turbo product codes (TPC), higher order modulation modes and support data rates from 64 Kbps to 52 Mbps. Items provided will be produced IAW the SOW and the Performance Specification.   The pricing will be in ranged quantities as specified in the solicitation.  Cost as an Independent Variable (CAIV) will be implemented on the Strategic E-BEM and the Tactical Variant. The Guaranteed Buy will include Strategic E-BEM, which includes NDI, NRE, FAT- NRE, all CDRLs, twenty (21) FAT modem units and three (3) spare modem units.  The Tactical Variant E-BEM includes NDI, NRE, FAT- NRE, all CDRLS and addendums, ten (10) FAT modem  units and two (2) spares.  The contract will be based on the best value to the Government to be determined under Source Selection Procedures.  The Government anticipates issuing the final solicitation on or about  26 August 2002 on the US Army Communications and Electronics Command (CECOM) Interagency Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP) web sit e (https://abop.monmouth.army.mil).  All parties interested in doing business with CECOM are invited to access, operate, send and receive information from the IBOP.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation an d any subsequent amendments or information.  The Department of Defense requires all contractors to be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) to receive contract award or payment.  See note 26.

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), National Emergency Training Center (NETC), Emergency Management Institute (EMI) partnering with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration?s (Department of Commerce) Coastal Services Center in Charleston, South Carolina has an Emergency Management Higher Education project/requirement to develop a stand alone, ready to teach, graduate-level college course on Coastal Hazards Management.  This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The associated NAICS code is 611430, Professional Development Training, and the small business size standard is $6.0 million [average annual receipts for three preceding fiscal years].  The goal of this requirement is to encourage and support the expansion of hazard, disaster and emergency management related education in colleges and universities across the United States so that in the future more emergency management and related personnel in government and in the private sector will come to the job not only with a college education, but with a course of study in emergency management as well.  In addition to encouraging the development of hazard, disaster and emergency management bachelor and graduate degree programs in United States colleges and universities.

Each Emergency Management Higher Education Project course shall be developed within the philosophical context of (1) building disaster resistant and resilient communities, and (2) seeking balance between the technocratic and the social vulnerability reduction approaches to emergency management.  Please refer to the Higher Education Project Slide Presentation at the following website address: http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/edu/hihgedbrief/course2.ppt    Course developers shall be college/university faculty with doctoral credentials and upper division college-level teaching experience, as well as emergency management, coastal hazards management and/or disaster field research experience.  

The purpose of this requirement is to develop a 45-48 hour contact hour classroom-based graduate-level course on ?Coastal Hazards Management.?  The final product shall be a complete and ready-to-use course, which could be taught, ?as is? at 4-year accredited colleges and universities at the graduate level.  The course shall be developed to expand the knowledge base of future and practicing emergency managers in the practices and intricacies of coastal hazards management; contribute to the professional development of practicing coastal management and related personnel; create interest in students entering the field of coastal hazards management; and to increase the interest of universities in the development of Coastal Hazard Management Certificate Programs.  

The course shall fulfill the requirements of a standard 3-semester hour college course at the graduate level and will need to contain more lecture material than can be used in a standard 45 contact-hour course in order to provide flexibility to the user.  All deliverables shall be Section 508 compliant.

<DESC>Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has developed a corrosion test cell for screening candidate bipolar plate materials for use in PEM (Polymer Electrolyte Membrane) fuel cells.  The cell has a transparent or translucent cell body having a pair of identical cell body members that seal against opposite sides of a bipolar plate.  The cell includes both an anode chamber and a cathode chamber, each on opposite sides of the plate.  Each chamber contains a pair of mesh platinum current collectors and a catalyst layer pressed between current collectors and the plate.  Each chamber is filled with an electrolyte solution that is replenished with fluid from a much larger electrolyte reservoir.  The cell includes gas inlets to each chamber for hydrogen gas and air.  As the gases flow into a chamber, they pass along the platinum mesh, through the catalyst layer, and to the bipolar plate.  The gas exits the chamber through passageways that provide fluid communication between the anode and cathode chambers and the reservoir, and exits the test cell through an exit port in the reservoir.  The flow of gas into the cell produces a constant flow of fresh electrolyte into each chamber.  Openings in each cell body member allow electrodes to enter the cell body and contact the electrolyte in the reservoir therein.  During operation, while hydrogen gas is passed into one chamber and air into the other chamber, the cell resistance is measured, which is used to evaluate the corrosion properties of the bipolar plate.

Advantages of the Technology 
-	This technology can be used to test the anode and cathode surfaces of a cell simultaneously
-	Users can measure ion concentrations versus time
-	Using this technology, resistance of the oxide layer versus time can be measured

Users of the Technology
LANL has been contacted by several fuel cell manufacturers or fuel cell component manufacturers interested in obtaining these cells for use in PEM fuel cell testing and development.  

Status
LANL is seeking parties interested in acquiring commercial license rights to the pending U.S. Patent for the purpose of manufacturing and selling the devices for use is PEM fuel cell testing and development efforts..  

Claims for this patent have been allowed by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office but the issue date for the patent is still pending.  The U.S. Patent application number for the technology is S.N. 09/602,402, filed June 23, 2000 (DOE reference no. S-91,782).  No foreign rights are available for this technology.  LANL intends to license this technology to a manufacturer with rights to make, use, and sell the technology to meet the needs of those parties currently requesting these cells.  LANL requests all responses to this posting be made to the point of contact below no later than September 6, 2002.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) Occupational Epidemiology Branch,(OEB) plans to procure the services of Dr. Srmena Krstev,
Institute of Occupational and Radiological Health, Deligradska 29, 11000 Belgrade, Yugoslavia
The services herein are non-commercial and are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M. The Occupational Epidemiology Branch is primarily involved with epidemiologic studies of occupational and other risk factors for cancer.  The purpose of the proposed contract is to obtain epidemiological data on cancer incidence and mortality patterns by various occupations in Belgrade, Serbia, and to obtain expertise in analysis, interpretation, and reporting of results on occupational risks of cancer, asthma, chronic bronchitis, and other selected chronic diseases in Belgrade and other economically developing countries, including Poland and China.  The social and economic turmoil in Serbia during the past decade have major adverse impact on the quality of living and working conditions, and workers there may have experienced unusual patterns of exposure to various industrial and environmental carcinogens.  The situation is further aggravated by the lack of resources for improvement of old fashioned technologies and replacement of worn out equipment to reduce exposures.  Minimum requirements: 1) experienced clinician who has had extensive experience in conducting research in occupational health. 2) a degree in medicine and advanced degree training in occupational health; 3) clinical experience in occupational medicine; 4) advanced training in epidemiology and experience in conducting occupational epidemiologic studies in developing countries; 5) experience in analyzing occupational and industrial data in relation to disease risks; 6) in depth understanding of the industrial and health care conditions in Serbia and other developing countries and the potential limitations of data from these countries that may influence interpretation of occupational study results from developing countries and; 7) experience in preparation of occupational study reports and manuscripts suitable for publication in scientific journals.  The services to be provided require a physician with advanced training in occupational health and epidemiology to assess the state of evidence for various occupation and disease associations, and to provide insight into possible biological mechanisms.  Experience with industrial conditions and epidemiologic studies in developing countries also is essential in the understanding and interpretation of results from these studies. Period of Performance: September 1, 2002 through August 31, 2002.  FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Service (November 1999) pertains to this order.  This requirement will be a fixed price order.  Dr. Srmena Krstev is the only known source to the NCI that has compiled cancer incidence and mortality data for various occupations in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. In addition, Dr. Krstev has advanced training in occupational health and epidemiology to assess the state of evidence for various occupations and disease associations, and to provide insight into possible biological mechanisms.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above services, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington D.C. time) on August 29, 2002.   If you have questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@excange.nih.gov or by fax at (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes being requested & written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a request for quotation.  Submit offers on RML-RFQ #2032.  Solicitation documents & incorporated provisions & clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-08 dated 06/27/02. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) & is a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 325414 & the small business size is 500. SCHEDULE: Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis(LHBP), has published genome sequences of two serotypes of Streptococcus pyogenes. LHBP needs to determine chemical sequence of seven other S. pyogenes serotypes. This project includes 5 steps.  Step1)Bioinformatics processing/analysis of 5 LHBP genomes. LHBP will deliver genomes to contractor for annotation & functional biochemical characterization using contractor bioinformatics infrastructure. Contractor shall perform annotation & analysis of genomes. Function to be assigned based on orthologous clustering, gene context/pathway reconstruction. Contractor will provide hardware/software/processed data to LHBP. Seven M serotypes, Streptococcus pyogenes genomes, need to be sequenced in three steps:  1) library construction, 2) 10X shotgun sequencing, & 3) genome finishing, leading to 5-10 contigs at average Q40 or higher per MB. Step2) library construction. Ea. Genome to be approx. 2.0MB in size. LHBP will send contractor purified total genomic DNA. Contractor will use DNA to construct two libraries, at ninety percent or greater cloning success, per genome/M-type. One library will be constructed using plasmid vector pGEM-3Z, where DNA is to be fragmented to average size of 2 kb and cloned. Second library using Loris 6 cosmid vector where fragments are generated by partial digestion, larger than 10kb, and cloned. Step3) 10X shotgun sequencing/preliminary annotation/comparison. Both libraries, transformed colonies, will be grown in petri trays & picked into 96 well plates by a robot at 3,000 colonies per hour. Ea. colony/clone must be named reflecting the organism, type of the library, cloning attempt, ID of 96-well plate & it's relative position in the plate. DNA will be purified from clones via mini-preps using robots. 96 well plates with purified plasmid DNAs must be stored in dedicated, specific freezers at -20 Celsius. Sequencing reactions will be performed in 384-well plates. IDs of 96-well plates must transfer to 384-well format. Sequencing reactions performed using ET MegaBACE Dye Terminator Kit. Sequencing reactions may be loaded onto MegaBACE 1000 DNA sequencers or ABI 3700 DNA sequencers. Samples sequenced from both ends, forward & reverse, using vector-specific primers for both plasmid libraries.   Passing sequence reactions will be at 500 bases of Q19-20 level or higher. A minimum of approx. 40,000 sequencing reactions at 500 bases length or higher, & Q19-20 quality or higher, for ea. genome.  Approx. 10,000 reads or higher must be performed ea. day during shotgun phase for ea. genome. 5-10% of total number of reads from cosmid library, while the rest will come from PGEM-3Z library. 10X assembly should produce between 100 & 250 contigs per genome. Contractor will compute, based on assembled sequences & summing sizes of contigs, better estimate of genome sizes. Contractor will do extra runs to bring the average coverage to 10X.  Total number of runs must not exceed 40,000 per genome without written approval by the RML Project Officer. Primary assembly of individual sequences performed using Phred/Cross_match/Phrap package. Following 10X assembly, data will be annotated. Genomes will be compared against all similar species publicly available or present at RML. A list of unique & conserved ORFs for ea. genome will be produced & transferred to LHBP. 10X sequencing reads & assemblies will be delivered & must be compatible with our Finch server(www.geospiza.com). Contractor will perform QC and forensic PCR tests to ensure no contamination between genomes during Step 2-3. Step4) Genome Finishing, annotation & comparison. Several rounds of primer-walking/manipulations with layout to be performed using Consed/AutoFinish editing software. Additional custom sequencing/PCR will be used to verify layout of reads, order (scaffold) contigs, raise quality levels for problem regions & join contigs.  Full, automated analysis involving ORF calling, gene annotation & functional reconstruction of genomes using an advanced bioinformatics system to be performed.  Three rounds (1-3) of functional assignments for all genes/every genome should be performed, two before completion of metabolic reconstruction, one after. Round 1 to be performed by algorithms that automatically predict function for as many genes as possible in genome. Round 2 to involve a detailed manual analysis by human experts. Manual inspection must involve use of more sensitive sequence similarity search tools as motif/pattern databases Pfam, Prosite, Prodom, & COGs. Contractor algorithms that explore predictive power of chromosomal clustering must be employed to predict putative function. When genes are assigned with functions, they should be placed in corresponding cellular pathways, with high detail & depth. Contractor should have a cellular pathway database with more than 5,000 cellular pathways. Expert manual curator must decide which of entire set of available pathways should be present for organism under study, & must provide a report for ea. genome. All possible connections across pathways must be delineated. An "in silico" reconstruction of organism must be produced. Functions expected, but are not present, will need to be identified. ORFs or pathways that are present/not present in sequenced strains, must be identified by genome comparison analysis, using LHBP genomes/public genomes. Round 3 will be manual & involve querying the function predicted present, against target. Contractor performs visit three days on site, for installation/training of database server. Government will supply LHBP sequenced genomes, a set of emm-specific/generic primer pairs & generic 16s primer pairs for Forensic PCR QC, text files of these sequences, purified, specific, genomic DNA for seven strains, suitable for library construction. DNAs will be supplied in 70% EToH & sent in time-separated manner to avoid genome contamination. Contractor to provide status reports. DELIVERABLES: Contractor will produce/provide following deliverables for Step 1.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Office of Applied Studies (OAS), intends to procure on an other than full and open competitive basis with Research Triangle Institute, 3040 Cornwallis Road, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, for continuation of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), to cover the 2004 survey year.  The statutory authority is 10 USC 2304(C)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This requirement is considered to be available from only one source because of the lengthy lead time required to develop an adequate infrastructure for conducting a survey of the size and complexity of the NSDUH.  As a result, SAMHSA has determined that award to any other source would likely require a significant learning period resulting in an unacceptable probability of failure, and resultant costs to the Government that are not expected to be recovered through competition.

The purpose of the NSDUH is to provide current data on substance use prevalence for the U.S. population (aged 12 and older) and each state, and to issue reports on survey results.  The survey sample will support annual direct estimates of prevalence for the nation, the eight (8) largest states, and model-based estimates for the remaining 42 states and the District of Columbia.  The contractor will be required to: (1) provide sufficient numbers of interviewers (approximately 750) and interviewer supervisory staff to screen approximately 182,500 dwelling units and conduct 67,500 interviews, using computer assisted interviewing technology; (2) develop training procedures/materials and conduct training classes to maintain a sufficient field staff and satisfy survey fieldwork goals; (3) have the statistical expertise to (a) employ a 50-state sample design, with an independent, multi-stage area sample for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, and (b) employ small area estimation techniques in order to develop model-based estimates for the 42 smaller states and the District of Columbia; and (4) maintain a staff with sufficient technical writing and analytical skills to complete/support the contract tasking.  The estimated period of performance is 38 months.  Numbered Notes 22 and 26 apply to this notice.  This announcement is for informational purposes only.  No solicitation is available.  Send written responses to the point of contact identified above, referencing 283-03-9028.

SOLICITATION NUMBER TDA02-Q-045

Definitional Mission for Agriculture Sector in Nigeria

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA) wishes to announce an opportunity for small business to bid on a Competitive Total Set-Aside to conduct a Definitional Mission (DM) to analyze the proposed projects.  The DM will review the following five projects submitted to TDA by the United States-Nigeria Development Institute, an Abuja-based NGO:  meat production and marketing; tomato production and marketing; rice farming and milling; agrochemical supply services assistance; and fish farming.  The five agriculture projects need further assessment and detailed terms of reference and budget, if recommended.  These projects are located in Kano, Edo, Plateau and Gombe States.  The DM team will also be requested to review a poultry project that was previously submitted to TDA.  In addition, the DM team will review other potential projects, in the same general area as the above stated projects, which they become aware of before and/or during their visit to Nigeria.  TDA will support funding for as many feasibility studies as the DM team determines meet TDA requirements.
  
The estimated cost for this work does not exceed $35,000.00.

TDA, located in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, promotes American private sector participation in developing and middle income countries, with special emphasis on economic sectors that represent significant U.S. export potential. Through the funding of feasibility studies, orientation visits, specialized training grants, business workshops, and various forms of technical assistance, we help U.S. businesses compete for infrastructure projects in emerging markets.  We assist in building mutually beneficial partnerships between American companies and overseas project sponsors, which result in increased U.S. exports and jobs, and the completion of high quality, successful projects in host countries.

In determining whether dominance exists for TDA purpose for this contract, consideration is given to annual gross receipts.  Any concern that is annual gross receipts above $5 million dollars, averaged over a three year period, is not considered small and is therefore, NOT eligible for award under this contract.

All participating organizations involved with supplying professional services must be incorporated or chartered in the United States.  Consultants planning teaming arrangements must be U.S. citizens or resident aliens.  In accordance with FAR 19.301, offerors will be required to submit self-certification relating to business size.  The competitive proposals method of solicitation as set forth in Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR Chapter 1) shall be utilized for this procurement.

Any explanation desired by an offeror regarding the meaning or interpretation of this solicitation must be requested in writing and with sufficient time allowed for reply to reach the offerors before submission of their offerors.  All oral explanations or instruction, given before award of this contract will not be binding.  Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning the solicitation will be furnished promptly to all prospective offerors as an amendment of the solicitation, if such information is necessary to offerors submitting proposals or if lack of such information would be prejudicial to uninformed offerors.

The contractor must be in the position to present fair and unbiased information pursuant to the statement of work.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Off-Campus Animal Holding/Husbandry Quarantine & Technical Services.  The services shall be for a) existing and future research animals/colonies, each with a widely varying colony health status (e.g. mice (congenic, transgenic, etc), rats, rabbits, guinea pigs & hamsters, etc); b) technical services (e.g. administration of special diets, antibody production (Monoclonal, Polclonal, etc), ascites production rederivation services, breeding and weaning services, administration of protocol related drugs and experimental substances, tail snipping, anesthesia support, specialized ocular exams, tissue harvesting, immunoassay, bleedings, inoculations, routine surgeries, euthanasia services, etc); c) quarantine facilities; and d) delivery services. Types/ Quantities of animals include 1) Rabbits (Conventional Housing)  - 3650 cage days/yr; 2) Rats (Conventional Housing) - 7300 cage days /yr.; 3) Rats  - (Microisolator Housing) - 18,250 cage days/yr.; 4) Mice (Conventional Housing) - 9125 cage days/yr; 5) Mice  - (Microisolator Housing) - 75,000 cage days/yr.; 6) Hamsters (Conventional Housing) - 100 cage days/yr; 7) Hamsters (Microisolator Housing) - 100 cage days/yr.; 8 ) Guinea Pigs (Conventional Housing) - 3650 cage days/yr.  Technical Services  estimated at 5200 hrs/yr; and Deliveries/Pick-up estimated at 300 ea/yr.  The performance period is for one year basic period begining o/a 1/1/03, with four one-year options.  Contractor shall be located within thirty (30) minutes for the NIH Campus,Bethesda, MD.  This time factor is required to reach the off-campus contract site from the NIH Bethesda campus.  A maximum transit time of 30 minutes is required to meet the majority of our institute's research/programmatic requirements.  This requirement is necessitated by the Government's need to move fragile embryos, tissues and other biological samples between the contract site and the NIH campus on a routine basis.  The majority of these samples are very susceptible to small environmental and physical changes, as some specimens begin degrading at time of collection.  In both of the above situations, the expeditious transport of the specimen between the contract site and laboratory is mandatory to insure positive and consistent experimental results.  Past experience has demonstrated that transport times in excess of thirty (30) minutes have not provided our research programs with the consistent results required for the Government's research programs.  In addition, in order to complete experiments, some investigators are required to make several trips between their laboratory and the contract site on the same day.  Transport times greator than 30 minutes will not allow these individuals to complete their required experimental manipulations within the required time period.  See numbered notes: 1.  Closing date 10AM local prevailing time on September 10, 2002.

<DESC>QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
Q: We quote our generator rates based on run time. Your RFQ specified dates from Sep. 10, 02 - Nov. 9, 02, however it did not specify the duty cycle. Should we infer these generators will be running 24 hours per day, and if so who is responsible for maintenance?
A: We anticipate the generators will be run an average of 16 hours per day, 7 days a week. The government/end user will start and stop the generators as needed, will add fuel as needed, will check level/add oil as needed, and will check level/add coolant as needed.
Q: Should we submit our bid based on hourly or daily rates?
A: You may submit your bid based on your standard practice. In any case, the bid should be based on a 16-hour run day with each generator separately priced.
Q: Can the 60KW unit be substituted with a 50KW unit?  A: Yes
Q: Will the contractor be dropping the generators off at one central location or at various locations on the base?
A: The generators will be delivered to Building 8425 yard (corner of Utah Ave. and Sixth Street.), will be unloaded from the truck, and will be placed on the ground.
Q: Who will unload the generators from the delivery truck?
A: The contractor will be responsible for unloading the generators.
Q: Will there be a forklift at the delivery location to help unload the generators?
A: No, the contractor will be responsible for providing necessary equipment. The government will instruct delivery personnel on exact locations in the yard where the generators will be placed.
Q: What is meant by military hitch? A: This type hitch is also known as a pintle hitch.
Q: Regarding the request for 200kw generators. Can you clarify the total loads on the generators in amperage. This will allow me to determine if our 176kw (194kw standby rating) generators will apply.
A: The 200 KW generator can be replaced by a 176 KW generator
Q: Regarding the request for 60kw generators. Can you clarify the total loads on the generators in amperage. This will allow me to determine if our 56kw (60kw standby rating) generators will apply.
A: The 60 KW generator can be replaced by a 56 KW generator
Q: Are state registration cards for the generators required?
A: The State of California requires generators operating on the base to have a current state registration card.
Q: Who will be responsible for repairs?
A: The contractor will be expected to repair or replace units that break down.

<DESC>This synopsis announces the scheduled availablility of the solicitation for this project.  The work will include the demolition of an existing greenhouse and the construction of a new 6-bay greenhouse attached to an existing headhouse.

Demolition will be the complete removal of the existing greenhouse.  This will include the disconnecting and removing of all electrical work associated with the greenhouse, including but not limited to lighting, receptacles, power to mechanical equipment, and service conductors.

<SUBJECT>D -- Command Communications Survivability Program (CCSP)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-CCSP0001
<CONTACT>Dawn McKenna, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-693-5995, Fax 703-614-6329, Email mckennad@army.pentagon.mil
<DESC>The Department of Defense (DoD) has established a need for the Command Communications Survivability Program (CCSP) under the auspices of the Pentagon Renovation Program.  The Government intends to award a contract for a CCSP Systems Integrator, who will be responsible for making necessary changes to the Information Technology (IT) infrastructure in the Pentagon and selected DoD facilities associated with the Pentagon.  These changes will facilitate the acceleration of planned renovation of Pentagon Common Information Technology infrastructure.  The goal of this Program is to ensure redundancy, survivability, recoverability, manageability, availability, scalability and security for four main communications areas.  These four main areas are Networks, Mainframe/Servers, Voice, and Messaging.  The CCSP Systems Integrator will be responsible for Networks, Mainframe/Servers, and Voice requirements (specifics for each area are discussed below).  The Messaging and Construction requirements are being implemented under separate acquisitions.  The CCSP Systems Integrator will be responsible for coordinating with the Messaging and the Construction contractors.  This Program affects multiple service agencies, and up to 40,000 users.  The estimated value of the System Integrator acquisition is over 400 million dollars and the performance period is expected to last through FY2005.

**Network**  CCSP Network will implement modifications to the existing Pentagon network infrastructure.  CCSP Network will acquire enhanced network security components, network services, networking components, passive infrastructure, and facilities/utilities work to support the required network modifications.  The effort needed to implement these network modifications include project management, engineering and integration activities.  CCSP Network is actually four enterprise networks with a separate network classified at SBU, Secret, Top Secret, and SCI.  CCSP Network activities will address the following four functional areas: Core, Distribution, Access and a single integrated Network Management System.  The integration of CCSP Network will be a significant technical challenge involving the integration of different IT systems (Voice, Mainframes, and Data Messaging) and the replacement of various generations of legacy networking equipment.  As part of the integration effort, all CCSP Network active components must be able to be monitored and controlled from the existing Network Systems Management Center and from an Alternate Network Systems Management Center.

**Voice**  CCSP Voice includes major telephone switch engineering and installation efforts.  The requirements will address survivability modifications for the Pentagon administrative voice telephone system, diverse and redundant voice circuits (trunks), and redundant voice telephone capabilities, infrastructure, critical end user devices (e.g., telephones), and facilities/utilities.

**Mainframe/Server**  CCSP Mainframe/Server includes extensive engineering and installation efforts for mainframe/server communications, diverse and redundant communications circuits (trunks), and acquisition and installation of redundant mainframe processors, memory and direct storage components and modules, storage area network components for data archiving and critical remote access, infrastructure, and facilities/utilities work supporting the mainframe/server and critical DoD application systems required for survivability.

**Contracting Information**  This acquisition will be accomplished in two phases.  In Phase I, a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) will be issued to all interested parties through full and open competition.  Once submitted, Qualifications will be evaluated against criteria established in the RFQ.  Based upon evaluation results, the Government will down-select to up to three offerors, who will participate in Phase II.  In Phase II, a Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued to the successful Phase I offerors.  The RFP will contain a Statement of Objectives (SOO) instead of a performance-based statement of work.  As part of their proposal, Phase II offerors will be tasked to develop and submit a Performance-Based Statement of Work, laying out their proposed approach for satisfying the government's requirements for the CCSP Integration effort.  The Government anticipates conducting a pre-proposal conference for the Phase II offerors only.  Proposals will be evaluated against criteria established in the RFP.  Discussions will take place if necessary and one offeror will be selected for award.  Based on the availability of funds, unfunded options will be included in the contract.  Interested potential offerors will be required to have facility and individual security clearances in order to review technical data necessary for proposal preparation in Phase II.  This Program involves four classification levels.  Parties interested in receiving the Phase I RFQ may send a request for the RFQ via e-mail to CCSP@army.pentagon.mil, with "Request for CCSP RFQ" in the subject line.  Questions regarding this acquisition should be directed to CCSP@army.pentagon.mil, with "CCSP Questions" in the subject line.  The Government anticipates issuing the Phase I RFQ approximately 30 days after publication of this notice.

<DESC>NA The US Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for development of pilot software necessary to design a system that will make ShakeMap data widely available immediately following large earthquakes.  This software will demonstrate the essential elements in the system with the information disseminated via the output of the ShakeMap system.   Vendor will supply pilot system for broadcasting and using ShakeMap, consisting of functional transmittal (server) tools and a receiver (client) tools including one that will be capable of creating a prioritized list of shaking levels at users facilities using facility data entered by the user and shaking data derived from ShakeMap.  The USGS intends to award a non-competitive purchase order to Gatekeeper Systems that owns the new software to develop and maintain the display maps of the areas affected by an earthquake.   THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY; No formal RFQ will be available.  NAICS code is 514191.

<DESC>Request for Information for Design of an Interactive Computer Driven Simulation Environment Modeling the Navy?s Enlisted Processing System

1.0 SUBJECT

This is a request for information (RFI) to develop an interactive (i.e. man-in-the-loop) computer assisted SIMulation modeling the business processes among three inter-related Navy groups, (1) Navy Personnel Plans & Policy (N13), (2) Commander, Navy Recruiting Command (CNRC) and (3) Chief of Naval Education and Training (CNET).  The purpose of the simulation exercise is to determine impact of policy changes using a systems approach.  The simulation is designated SimPPRT.

2.0 DESCRIPTION

CNRC is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development and deployment of an interactive computer driven simulation, SimPPRT.  The simulation should enable the Navy?s Personnel triumvirate to participate in ?war gaming? sessions to test how proposed polices and budgetary decisions will impact the flow of Sailors through the initial training pipeline.  This should include simulating the impact on the recruit market and the flows through boot camp and ?A? school.  Such simulation games have been widely used to both train and evaluate combat.  To date the application of this technology to personnel situations has been limited.  

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

&#61607; Conceptual technical alternatives for a computer assisted simulation
&#61607; Technical feasibility assessments
&#61607; Approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.)
&#61607; Schedule estimates
&#61607; Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, operating, and managing SimPPRT.

3.0 REQUIREMENTS

This section enumerates the high-level functional requirements for SimPPRT.  For purposes of responding to the RFI an information exchange meeting will be held for interested parties (see Section 5.0 below). 

&#61607; SimPPRT must allow for each Navy personnel group to interact with the simulation in the conduct of simulated exercises (?war games?) from diverse locations (presumably via the Internet) in real-time mode.
&#61607; In addition to operating in an interactive mode, SimPPRT must have the capability to operate in a constructive context.  This capability can be either stochastic or deterministic.
&#61607; Access to SimPPRT must be platform independent and controlled by username and password.  It should allow users to logon independently or in-group sessions.
&#61607; SimPPRT must have the capability to save scenarios and a replay capability storing these scenarios in a library for future reference.  Users will be able to designate their scenarios as public or private.
&#61607; SimPPRT must be designed in modules that are capable of being run either independently or in concert.
&#61607; The modules should cover the planning process, the recruiting process and the training process.
&#61607; The planning module should model the impact of external events on requirements and resources and should handle the interactions between the other modules to minimize disturbances in the system.
&#61607;  The recruiting module should model the market supply and placement of recruits into the training pipeline with the appropriate quantity, quality and timing.
&#61607; The training module should model how recruiting results along with changes in resources and requirements impact training capacity and affect awaiting instruction time.
&#61607; SimPPRT must produce standard reports detailing all assumptions and pertinent results of scenarios.
The purpose of the RFI is to gather information about those requirements enumerated above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses.

<DESC>USAIDs Bureau Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade intends to support a two-year no-cost extension to the EdData sole-source contract (HNE-I-00-99-00298-00) with Macro, International. EdData is an international data program that collects national-level and family-level data on household demand for education. This two-year extension (or contract modification if awarded to Macro International) will be awarded to a firm with a well established track record in implementing large-scale, national level household educational surveys in developing country settings.  The firm must be able to access the sampling frames and cadre of professionals used in countries by the MEASURE DHS+ surveys to assure that sampling plan is carried out with a subset of the same household so that the two surveys can be linked easily.  In its work, the firm is expected to assist USAID missions to generate support for surveys from other international donors, and to collaborate with the MEASURE DHS+ implementers doing similar surveys.  The type of activities to be supported during this extension period include nationally representative household education surveys, small quantitative education surveys, and the production of education indicators from DHS+ surveys.  Any business with the above capability is invited to forward a capability statement (limited to two pages).

<DESC>Request for Information for 
Electronic Records Archives


The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is considering the introduction of state of the art technology into the NARA infrastructure to achieve an Electronic Records Archives (ERA) capability.  ERA is a strategic initiative for achieving NARA??s mission to preserve valuable electronic records of the Federal Government and to make them available to future generations.  

This RFI is intended strictly for market research purposes and may not lead to a solicitation or contract.  The preliminary ERA business and contracting approach outlined below is for a full-and-open competition for a system that will meet the objectives stated in the ERA Mission Needs Statement, August 1, 2002. Full and open competition is the preferred approach in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253, as implemented by FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. The contract will be structured using modular contracting, an evolutionary acquisition approach that provides useable outputs at the completion of each increment, while taking advantage of developing technology for each succeeding increment. This evolutionary acquisition approach should lower overall program risk, take advantage of technology insertion, and, over time, save valuable budget dollars.

The intent of this acquisition is to initially award two or three contracts for system design, using a best value competition, based on an open systems approach with maximum utilization of COTS components. The Government intends to retain unlimited rights in data for any systems, processes, or items developed under these contracts.  Contractor retained rights will be the subject of further discussion.  These contracts will have provisions for a final source selection down select to a single contractor at the end of the Design Phase.  The Design Phase duration is expected to be eighteen months. The ERA will be implemented based on the selected design, using an incremental development approach.  A maximum of five increments (options) is anticipated.  The first increment will incorporate sufficient core functionality to achieve an Initial Operational Capability.  Unimplemented requirements will be allocated to successive increments as needed to achieve Full Operational Capability. The acquisition strategy requires all offerors to compete for total program requirements in the form of priced options; therefore ensuring price competition through the design phase and all foreseeable increments. As discussed below, you are encouraged to provide comments on the ERA acquisition approach.

The Government's preliminary view is that the design phase and first three incremental options should be Fixed Price Award Fee contracts (potentially, incentive fees could also be used). Later increments, if any, may be initially bound by not-to-exceed pricing, which would be fixed priced during best and final offers during the design down select. 

The Government is soliciting information to identify potential contractors capable of acting in the role of systems integrator to build the ERA. The Government is also seeking information from hardware and software vendors to ensure that all available commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products that provide capabilities applicable to the ERA have been identified. All manufacturers and suppliers of hardware and software technology that could be applied to support management of records across their lifecycles, and especially long-term preservation and access to authentic records, are offered this opportunity to describe how the Government can best employ their products to meet ERA mission needs. In addition to currently available products, the Government wants to understand the capabilities of leading-edge products currently under development that will be available by mid Fiscal Year 2004.  The information submitted will be used to assist the Government in the continuing development of its ERA acquisition strategy.

BACKGROUND
NARA ensures ready access to essential evidence that documents the rights of citizens, the actions of Federal officials, and the national experience.  NARA supports lifecycle management of records in all three branches of the Federal Government and provides sustained access to historically valuable records in the National Archives and the Presidential Libraries. The scope of NARA??s responsibilities include federal records, as defined at 44 U.S.C. 3301, presidential records, as defined at 44 U.S.C. 2201, records of the Congress and the Supreme Court, and also donated historical materials from non-federal sources.

Increasingly, these records are created and maintained in electronic formats. NARA needs to respond effectively to the challenge posed by the diversity, complexity, and enormous volume of electronic records being created today and the rapidly changing nature of the systems that are used to create them. Electronic records pose unique difficulties. The most critical is advancing technology that renders record formats or media obsolete in a short period of time. NARA??s solution to these problems must defeat technological obsolescence and ensure that electronic records are as authentic decades in the future as they were when first created. 

NARA's existing solutions for electronic records also will be unable to accommodate the enormous volume of data, and the number of records that are likely to be transferred to the National Archives or Presidential Libraries over the next few years.  For instance, a conservative 1999 estimate indicates that the yearly volume of email traffic in the Federal Government is approaching 36.5 billion messages per year. Although only a percentage of those messages may be permanently valuable, the volume is still orders of magnitude larger than what NARA has had to manage in the past. Moreover, the Census Bureau will be transferring images of up to 600 million pages of information, comprising tens of terabytes of data, from the 2000 Census. In comparison, in its thirty-year history, NARA has captured and fully-processed only between one and two terabytes of data.

NARA intends to make an investment in Electronic Records Archives capabilities to capture, preserve, and provide access to electronic records indefinitely into the future.  NARA is currently developing formal system requirements that will be used as the basis for implementation of the ERA.

NARA has entered into research partnerships aimed at developing standards for preserving and delivering authentic digital records over indefinite periods of time, including the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference model. 

NARA is participating in a number of research activities and prototypes aimed at improving the knowledge base for developing and evaluating potential technical solutions.  These include the Persistent Archives project being performed by the National Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure, and the Presidential Electronic Records Processing Operational System (PERPOS) project, a collaborative effort by the Army Research Laboratory and Georgia Tech Research Institute.  The existence of these demonstration programs and prototypes does not imply a commitment by NARA to require incorporation of the associated technologies and architectures into ERA.

More detailed information is available at the ERA web site, http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives. 

Acquisition related information, including the ERA Mission Needs Statement, can be located on the ERA web site by selecting the ERA Acquisition Information heading on the site??s main page; or go directly to: http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives/acquisition_information.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to purchase Data Analysis and Coverage Data  spreadsheets from the mass drug distribution program in American Samoa for the year 2002 distribution from Research Corporation University of Hawaii, 2800 Woodlawn Drive, Ste. 200, Honolulu, HI  98600.  The data sets will be used by CDC project officers to assist the Samoan government in modifying the community outreach strategies to achieve the necessary 80% or greater coverage levels for the island population. Coverage of at least 80% each year for five successive years is needed to stop the transmission of fialriasis and eventually lead to elimination of this disease in American Samoa. The data sets will include coverage data as well as laboratory specimen data.  In 1963, blood surveys in American Samoa indicated a microfilaria prevalence of 26%. After mass drug administrations (MDAs) of DEC during the 1960s, microfilarial prevalence dropped to 0.4%. The filariasis prevention program was discontinued in the early 1970s. A recent serosurvey in 1999 of 3018 persons with the ICT card test indicated that 21.4% of men and 12.2% of women were infected (average 16.6%). The current high levels of W. bancrofti transmission in American Samoa threaten major international efforts to eliminate filariasis in the South Pacific. In November, 1999 American Samoa reinstated mass drug treatment for the population. This effort went on for seven months and at the end of the period 10,968 persons had received therapy, representing a coverage level of 19%. A coverage level of 85% in a very short period of time is needed to interrupt transmission.   The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors providing the requested product. Therefore, the initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a technical and price standpoint. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541710 and the Size Standard is 500  employees for this requirement. This requirement is a not small business set-aside.  Interested vendors capable of furnishing the government with the products in this synopsis should submit two (2) copies of a quotation to the below address. The quotation shall include the itemized price, prompt payment terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), Taxpayer Identification Number (TNN), Dun & Bradstreet Number (DUNs), and descriptive literature of the product quoted. The quotation must reference  Solicitation number RFQ # 2002-Q-00644.   Quotations will be due fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this synopsis or August 29, 2002, by 8:30 a.m. local time, whichever is later.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is R33-7MN1-02 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The NAICS is 334516, business size 500 employees.  This solicitation document incorporates those provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-08.  The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center requests the procurement of one Automated Vision Image Analyzer "Name Brand or Equal" to the GrainCheck 312 Analyzer from Foss North America Inc.  Our main goal is to develop rice varieties for use in conventional breeding programs that have grain qualities suitable for U. S. consumers.  The U. S. market prefers a long, slender type grain whereas some other countries prefer a shorter, fatter grain.  Since the variations in different varieties can be extremely small, accurate measurements are a must.  Our current method consists of taking a pair of calipers and measuring the length, width and thickness of hundreds of grains of rice.  A time consuming and difficult process.  The rice analyzer will allow us to take hundreds of measurements quicker and more accurately.  The analyzer will also allow us to detect impurities in our seed, such as two varieties being mixed together.  Milling yields can be calculated.  This information is extremely important to producers.  Image analysis is used for rice grading.  Rice is usually consumed as whole grain and typical characteristics such as shape, size, uniformity and color are important.  The majority of rice consumed and preferred in the US is long grain.  Image analysis is also used for assessment of rice quality.  Broken kernels have to be minimized and the different rice qualities guarantee a maximum number of broken rice kernels.  An image analyzer  will help determine if the size of the grains that we are producing will be satisfactory for US consumers.  Complete package will include grain analyzer, feeder belt for small grains, color video system, computer preloaded with software to include ability to analyze both broken kernels in milled long grain and brown long grain, monitor, accessory kit, and users manual.  The contractor shall perform all delivery, set-up and training so that the Grain Analyzer is complete and ready to use.  The Grain Analyzer shall be delivered to the USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center, 2890 Hwy 130 E, Stuttgart, Arkansas, 72160.  The Government "REQUIRES" delivery no later than 60 days after receipt of order, however, each offeror shall include their proposed delivery schedule as part of their quotation.  Acceptance and FOB point are destination.  In order to be considered for award offerors shall provide a quotation on company letterhead detailing the unit pricing; descriptive literature, brochures, and five references for the proposed equipment.  References must have received the proposed equipment within the last three calendar years (Government references preferred but will accept commercial references) shall also be provided for the product quoted.  52.252-2 CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE;  FAR 52.212-4 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS;   FAR 52.212-5 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS applies, with the following clauses from (a) 52.222-3,  Convict Labor; 52.233, Protest after award, and (b) FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns;  FAR 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; FAR 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans; FAR 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities; FAR 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans; FAR 52.222-19, Child Labor - Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies; FAR 52.225-13, Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases; FAR 52.232-34,Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - Other than Central Contractor Registration; applicable to this acquisition: FAR 52.252-1 SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE; FAR 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, FAR 52.212-2  EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, the significant evaluation factors, in the relative order of importance, are (i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement; (ii) past performance; and (iii) price (based on F.O.B.

<DESC>Specifications for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer

(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. (ii)  This solicitation number RFQ-032-4384-02 is issued as a request for quotations.  (iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-07.  (iv)  Procurement will be on an unrestricted basis.  The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 334516.  For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business size standard is 500 employees.  (v) CLIN 1- MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer, 1 each.  (vi) USDA, ARS, the Soybean and Nitrogen Fixation Unit as Raleigh, NC has a need for a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer, which will be used to identify proteins selected from 2-D gels, as part of a new proteomics initiative within the Unit.  We are interested in identifying membrane proteins that are associated with certain seed composition phenotypes (e.g., high seed protein content); in identifying soluble proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with proteins of interest (to identify protein: protein interactions); in identifying phosphorylation sites in proteins; and to identify sequences contained within fragments produced during the degradation of metabolic proteins in vivo.  In some cases, we want to get a measurement of the molecular mass of the full length protein (as obtained from the gel spot), and thus, the MS must be capable of measurements in the high mass range (> 100 kDa).  In other cases, the protein will be digested with a proteolytic enzyme and a ?peptide fingerprint? will be obtained.  Thus, the instrument must have high resolution so that useful information can be obtained and the protein identified by comparison with public databases.  However, in come cases, proteins will be obtained from species such as soybean and spinach where the genome has not been completely sequenced.  In these cases, it is essential that the instrument have the potential to produce sequence information from selected peptides.  The following specifications must be met: 1.  Benchtop instrument that is easy to operate and does not require a dedicated technician.  The instrument will be used as needed, and not as a high-throughput continuous use system.  For example, in computer target viewing optics to facilitate easy and accurate sample analysis would be useful.  2.  High resolution instrument (> 10,000).  This will allow for accurate tryptic peptide fingerprints to be generated that in some cases will unequivocally identify the parent protein.  Lower resolution will limit the utility of the instrument for research purposes.  3.  Instrument must be capable of automatic Post Source Decay (PSD) analysis of a selected peptide, which provides MS/MS data from the selected peptide and in many cases provides amino acid sequence information.  This is an essential feature because in many cases, deduced sequence information for the protein will not be accessible from public databases.  Without this capability, our research with species other than ?model? organisms such as Arabidopsis, will be limited.  4.  Instrument must come complete with a high performance computer, printer and all necessary software to acquire and analyze data as specified above.  The PC must be based on the Windows NT platform so that data obtained can be interfaced with other lab computers and on-line searches.  5.  Instrument must be delivered within 8 weeks of ordering and installed in the laboratory by the manufacturer within 4 weeks of delivery.  This will allow research to get underway as soon as possible.  6.  Manufacturer to provide training for at least one person, to insure that the instrument will be properly used and maintained. (vii)  Delivery  is required within 8 weeks of award during our normal business hours from 8:00 - 4:30 PM EDT,  Monday through Friday.   Delivery is FOB Destination to USDA-ARS-SAA, Plant Science Research Building, 3127 Ligon Street, Raleigh, NC 27607, Attn: Dr. Steve Huber.  Inside delivery is required. Acceptance shall be made at destination. (viii) The provision as 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  In addition, the provision at 52.204-6 applies, requiring offers to provide their DUNS numbers as part of their quotations. (ix) The contracting officer will make award based on price and price-related factors. (x) Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror/Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, with its proposal.  (xi) FAR 52.212.4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. (xii) FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Order, applies to this acquisition.  The following FAR clauses cited in 52-212-5, which are to be indicated by the contracting officer as incorporated by reference, are applicable to this acquisition: 52.203-6, 52.219-8, 52.219-23 ALT I, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222.26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-3, 52.225-13, 52.232-34 and 52.247-64.  (xiii) The contractor shall extend to the Government the full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale, provided such warranty is available at no additional cost to the Government.  Acceptance of the standard commercial warranty does not waive the Governments rights under the Inspection clause nor does it limit the Governments rights with regard to the other terms and conditions of this contract.  In the event of a conflict, the terms and conditions of the contract shall take precedence over the standard commercial warranty.  The contractor shall provide a copy of its standard commercial warranty (if applicable) with its response.
