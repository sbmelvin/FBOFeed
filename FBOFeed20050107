<DESC>Battle Management Systems Wing (ESC/MB-MP), 11 Barksdale Street, Bldg 1614, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-1700  - MISSION PLANNING SYSTEM LIFE CYCLE UPGRADE AND MAINTENANCE SUPPORT; Stephen Smith, Contracting Officer, 781-266-9086 NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA). This action serves as notice that on or about 24 Jan 05 the Mission Planning Program Office, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731 intends to solicit and negotiate with BAE Systems, Hudson NH to provide continued sustainment and support for the MPS core and Aircraft/Weapon/Electronic software components.  This is a stopgap measure until this work can be added as a delivery order on the MPEC contract.  The Period of Performance for this contract action will not exceed 5 months. The MPS encompasses 1,282,970 lines of code.  This task requires experience and expertise with the MPS core application, source code, its development environment and COTS software dependencies (notably Solaris 2.5.1 and Sybase 4.9.2 and changes to more up-to-date versions Solaris 9 and Sybase 12.5).  Additionally, experience is required with MPS unique bindings and interoperability of these bindings with A/W/E Mission Planning Environment (MPE).  The contractor shall be responsible for subsequent maintenance releases in support and maintenance of the B-2, B-52, F-117 functional requirements.  Among the requirements are the upgrade of the B-52's cartridge-cutting device and the B-2's Divert Path capability.  The current cartridge-cutting device for the B-52 is a 9-track magnetic tape cartridge, which is altogether obsolete and frequently breaks apart during use.  The next release will have to provide access to state-of-the-art microchip technology, which will significantly increase the amount of data available for missions, the rate at which it can be transferred, and its reliability. In support of the B-2 platform, the task will include, but is not limited to, the correction of a Divert Path capability for Multiple Control Times deficiency report.  Currently, the B2 MPS does not allow processing of multiple control times on missions that contain multiple alternate (divert) paths.  Nor does it produce appropriate flight plans with the required data on message types.  Immeasurable cost is incurred due to errors caused by multiple computations and manual assembly of data. Errors of this type could require the unit to re-fly and strike targets a second time.  Re-strike of targets impact theatre operations both in time, dollars and holding other targets at risk. Further, the support and maintenance work includes management (administrative, contract and security), software development and maintenance, testing, documentation, and release activities.  Support for a Materiel Improvement Program Review Board (MIP RB), Requirements Review Board (RRB) and other associated meetings are required.  Interfaces to external data sources shall be maintained, including but not limited to Mapping, Charting, Geodesy and Intelligence (MCG&I), Weather and Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF). Additional support to A/W/E developers include technical support, interoperability investigations, design evaluations, documentation review, technical reviews, interface control, problem reporting, software problem assistance, A/W/E Testing and Integration, MPS Development Software Distributions and A/W/E-peculiar tasks.  The contractor shall provide technical support to A/W/E programs to include question and answers (Q&A) concerning MPS core software and interfaces, maintenance of a Q&A Database, A/W/E developer MPS software tape reproduction and distribution. Contractor shall provide support for on-site software installation, interoperability investigations related to A/W/E developments and assistance with A/W/E development documentation/software/test. The contractor shall also support working groups, not limited to, MPS WG meetings, Security WGs, MPS Technical Interface Meetings (TIMs), A/W/E WGs, Interface Control WGs and MPS Developer's WG. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) nor Request for Proposal (RFP). This notice signifies the Government's intent to issue a sole source contract, pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c)(1).  The period of performance of this contract will not exceed 31 Jul 05.  See Note 26.

<DESC>“This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.”  The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport proposes to establish multiple indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts through the Small Business Administrations “8(a)” program to provide engineering, life cycle & in-service support services to Submarine Non-Propulsion Electronic Systems Programs (NPES).  These five year, cost plus fixed fee contracts will incorporate performance based service contracting features including fee adjustment.  Labor categories will include electronics engineers, computer engineers, systems engineers, analysts, configuration specialists, logisticians and related skills.  Many personnel will require experience with Submarine NPES, comprising Combat, Acoustic, Navigation, Communication, Weapon-Launch and other NPES.  The Level of Effort for all contracts combined will be approximately 141,000 manhours per year, approximately 63,000 manhours being in Government provided office space.  Selection will be best-value based on past performance, personnel and facilities and realistic cost.   We will require personnel with both the skills to perform the work and familiarity with many of the military systems identified in the Statement of Work.  This is a follow-on effort to contract N66604-99-D-0683 with Raytheon Technical Services Company of Reston, VA.  Significant subcontractors include Systems Engineering Associates Corp. and EG&G.   Much of the work requires security clearances.  Some work will require TOP-SECRET clearance.  The contractors’ local facilities will need clearance for retention of SECRET information.  As required by FAR 5.205(f), competition is limited to eligible 8(a) concerns.  Eligibility to participate may be restricted to firms in either the developmental stage or the developmental and transitional stages.  Interested 8(a) firms should request (download) a copy of the solicitation as expeditiously as possible since the solicitation will be issued without further notice upon SBA acceptance of the requirement for the section 8(a) program.
Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.  Instead, they may be accessed at our web site http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/.  We also provide electronic access in our Bid Room.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This acquisition will be Sole Source to General Purpose Vehicles (GPV) LLC, New Haven, MI.  (See Government-Wide number notes 22 and 26)  E-mail:  kowalskt@tacom.army.mil Contract Specialist or mikad@tacom.army.mil Contracting Officer. The effort requires the design and fabrication of a Load Handling System (LHS) on one prototype demonstrator, and the design and purchase of long lead items to incorporate a 10-ton dump bed on a second prototype demonstrator. This action also includes an o ption to fabricate the dump prototype demonstrator. Both vehicle designs will incorporate the existing GPV design for a 6x6 with tag axle prototype medium cargo truck, as a baseline. A modified performance specification was drafted to set forth requirement s for the enhanced performance desired, as well as a unique annex for each prototype variant. Both designs will incorporate GPV-patented, proprietary technology in the wheel end design, steering system and the drive line configuration.  The designs will al so include an enhanced ballistic/mine protected cab, incorporate IR and RF signature suppression technology, a hybrid drivetrain, disk brake/all wheel steer independent suspension, expanded fording/trench crossing capability.  The LHS prototype demonstrato r will have the capability to offload ISO containers and flat racks from aircraft, without assistance.  The Dump design will incorporate an armored bed and potential capability to enable the truck to carry a larger load than the current FMTV 10-Ton dump.

The site is bounded by Worth Street to the North, Duane Street to the South, Broadway to the West, the Federal Plaza building  to the East and sits on top of an existing parking garage below grade.

Potential offerors are advised that the General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service operates under strict security regulations and contractors and all contractor employees, subcontractors, etc. will be required to adhere to all security requirements including but not limited to fingerprinting and background checks. 

This procurement will be conducted using the best value continuum - trade off source selection process in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15. 101-1 and will be solicited using the Advisory multi-step process in accordance with FAR 15.202. Based on the complexity and importance of this project the Government deems it to be in its best interest to consider award to the contractor offering the best value to the Government.  Therefore for this procurement, the technical evaluation factors when combined will be significantly more important than price.

This Advisory multi-step process will be solicited in two steps.  Issuance of this pre solicitation notice is the first step.  The second step will be the issuance of a Request for Proposals (RFP).  This initial step invites potential offerors to submit specific information as described below.

SUBMISSION DESCRIPTION/REQUIREMENTS

Pre solicitation Step

In the pre solicitation step, potential offerors will be invited to submit information which conforms to the following technical evaluation factors:

Factor No. 1		Experience on Similar Projects			300 points

Factor No. 3		Qualifications of Key Personnel	                          150 points
Total possible points under pre solicitation submission:			700 points

Each submission will be reviewed in accordance with the minimum requirements listed for each factor.  After review of each submission, each potential offeror will be advised, in writing, by GSA either that it is invited to participate in the Request for Proposal (RFP) step of this procurement, or based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  Notwithstanding the advice given by GSA, all potential offerors responding to step one will be advised that they may participate in the next step of this procurement process.  FIRMS THAT DO NOT SUBMIT WRITTEN RESPONSES TO THIS PRE SOLICITATION NOTICE WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO COMPETE IN SUBSEQUENT STEPS OF THIS PROCUREMENT.

RFP Step

The second step of this procurement will be the issuance of a Request for Proposal package to all potential offerors found to be viable competitors under the initial step of the procurement.  Should a potential offeror who was found to be a nonviable competitor request a copy of the RFP package, the Government will provide it.  Upon issuance of the RFP, potential offerors will be required to provide a notarized statement from a Treasury approved surety  stating that the offeror has bonding capacity equal to or greater than the estimated construction cost range of this project.  Offerors will also be required to provide evidence that they are licensed as a  general contractor in the State of New York.

The RFP will require the submission of two separate packages to be submitted simultaneously.  The first package will be a Technical Proposal and will include the offeror's response to the following technical evaluation factors:

Factor No. 4	  Project Management Plan                      				250 points

The second package will be a Price Proposal.   The Technical Proposals will be opened first and evaluated by the Government.  Once the technical evaluation is completed, (the evaluation will include the Technical Evaluation Factors issued under both the Pre-Solicitation Notice and the RFP) the Price Proposals will be opened.  The Price Proposals shall be segregated from the Technical Proposals and placed in a separate envelope.  

The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions, but if a decision is made to conduct discussions with offerors, the Contracting Officer will establish a competitive range. (see FAR 15.306).

Each offeror's technical evaluation results from the pre solicitation step of this procurement will be carried forward into the RFP step of this procurement which will result in an offeror receiving a possible total point score of 1,000 (700 points from the pre solicitation step and 400 from the RFP step)

<DESC>This is a 100% 8(a) set-aside competitive procurement and is open to 8(a) firms only.  The Government intends for the 8(a) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) vehicle to be awarded as 3 to 5 contracts from a single solicitation.  Resulting 8(a) MACC contracts will be Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The minimum guarantee for each offeror awarded a contract is $15,000.  The $15,000 minimum guarantee will be deducted from the first Task Order awarded to each contractor.  The contract duration consists of a one-year base period and two one-year option periods.  The Not To Exceed (NTE) amount for the life of the overall 8(a) MACC vehicle is $60 Million.  Task Orders will be firm fixed price with an award range between $100,000 and $1,500,000.    
	Task Orders will consist of new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, and repair work, including any necessary design.  Task Orders may include the following types of scopes of work: design-build, 100% design, performance-based, or a combination thereof.  Projects will potentially be located at various locations serviced by Engineering Field Activity Northwest (EFA NW) including but not limited to Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska, but primarily Washington State.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236; Construction of Buildings. The applicable size standard is $28.5M.

     Award will be based on a tradeoff (best value) source selection, considering evaluation factors that will be identified in the solicitation.  At time of award the highest rated offeror will receive the seed project and the next most highly ranked offerors selected for contract award will receive the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate MACC proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Therefore, each initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a technical and cost or price standpoint.  Offerors should not assume they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposal.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be in the best interests of the Government.         
     The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contract awardees are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Task Order evaluation factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each Task Order and may be competed on the basis of price, trade-off analysis (best value), or low price technically acceptable.  Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each Task Order award, except under those circumstances described in FAR 16.505.
     Competition for this procurement is limited to eligible 8(a) firms located in Washington State and 8(a) participants in good standing serviced by a SBA office outside of Washington State but having a bona fide branch office in Washington State.  A bona fide branch office is a place of business for purposes of 8(a) construction procurements located where an 8(a) participant regularly maintains an office that employs at least one full-time individual within the appropriate geographical boundary.

<DESC>National Park Service - Mount Rainier Park and North Cascades National Park located in Washington State.   This is a Sources Sought Market Survey to identify potential qualified rotor wing aviation operators capable of providing on-call helicopter services for Search and Rescue (SAR) operations for the National Park Service, Mount Rainier National Park and North Cascades National Park within the state of Washington.  Flight services will be fully contractor operated and maintained.  Operators will be required to be certificated under 14 CFR, Part 135, Air Taxi Operators & Commercial Operators and Part 133, Rotorcraft External-Load Operations.   Background:  The National Park Service has a requirement for year round on-call helicopter services to support their SAR operations for the two parks.  Typical altitude ranges from sea level to 12,000 feet.  Typical terrain includes high mountains and glaciers and may include snow landings.  Types of work to be performed include; low-level (less than 500 feet above ground level) reconnaissance flights, short-haul, slingload operations, toe-in step-out landings, as well as annual short-haul training for National Park Service employees located at North Cascades National Park.  Although not a requirement, it is desirable that the helicopter operator provide a rescue litter.  Aircraft will not be used for interagency fire operations.   Historically the Parks experience two to seven aerial SAR events per year for both Parks combined.  Available funding for SAR air operations is $12,000 per year.  The Parks have a cooperative agreement with the Oregon Army Reserves National Guard to provide services in the event that a commercial operator is not available.   Due to the emergency nature of the SAR operations, operators base of operations shall be located within a flight time distance of 90 minutes to either Park in order to fulfill adequate response times to individual missions.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) is interested in education institution/academic research submissions of capability statements to support efforts under an anticipated Marine Corps Research University (MCRU) type contract relationship environment.  MCSC desires to maintain a contractual relationship with academia to maintain a MCRU strategic relationship initiative.  The purpose of this initiative is to provide the Marine Corps with continued needed capability to respond effectively and rapidly, without reliance on other services’ contractual arrangements, to growing requirements in the areas of Engineering, Scientific Research and Business/Logistics.  The ability to obtain academia services of consistently high quality that builds upon past knowledge and research and to engage academia on a regular basis with minimum procurement lead-time is highly desired.  Key areas for possible tasks under Engineering include; but is not limited to; non-lethal technologies, alternative power sources, human factors, imaging technologies and sensor systems. Key areas for possible tasks under Scientific Research include; but is not limited to; modeling and simulation research, applied research, quantitative analysis, and independent evaluations.  Key areas for possible tasks under Business/Logistics include; but is not limited to; supply chain and logistics technologies, manpower analysis, and developmental technology investment analysis.  It is anticipated that this effort is needed for a period of 12 months with four (4), one (1) year option periods.  In order to allow the MCSC to efficiently task the contractor with minimal procurement lead-time, an indefinite delivery type contract incorporating individual delivery/task orders will most likely be utilized for this effort. Deliverables, period of performance, and work requirements will be defined by the Project Office and identified within each order. 

The MCSC requests that all interested parties submit a capability statement of not more than ten (10) pages submitted on 8.5 by 11 paper at 12 pitch or greater font size, that addresses the following areas:  (1) past Research and Development (R&D) performance, (2) past performance with USMC related R&D efforts, (3) past performance with USMC related academic studies and analysis, (4) in-house capability as it relates to research facilities, faculty, graduate students, etc., (5) existing strategic business partnerships (6) experience as a recognized center of excellence in a particular discipline, (7) capability to perform classified work, and (8) level of experience with Government contracting.  Additionally all respondents are requested to include the resumes of key personnel identified as principle investigators in areas that you are a recognized center of excellence.  Note that the resumes will not be counted as a part of the 10 pages.  The deadline for receipt of capability statements is COB, December 22, 2004.  All capability statements should electronically mailed to dwight.micheal@usmc.mil.  This RFI is not an authorization to incur cost in anticipation of a resultant contract.  Information provided herein is subject to amendment and in no way binds the Government to the award of a contract. Technical questions must be addressed in writing to Dr. Peter Denega, via fax at (703) 432-3322 or via e-mail at denegap@mcsc.usmc.mil.  Contractual questions may be addressed to Mr. Dwight Micheal, Sr., at (703) 432-3740.

These systems will be used to record images of ice so the capability must be included to set an auxiliary shutter rate down to 2 microseconds that will reduce glare for pixels affected by light reflections from the ice surface. "Three camera systems will be required and must be delivered no later than 5 weeks ARO. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.

<SUBJECT>Y -- OFFUTT AFB, NE, MFH PRIVATIZATION
<DESC>Jones Lang LaSalle Privatization Support Contractor, acting on behalf of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), and the Air Force Combat Command, anticipates the release of its Request for Proposal for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska on or about 10 January 2005. Jones Lang LaSalle intends to employ a one-step RFP process. In their proposals each prospective Offeror (or Offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources, financial strategy, and a description of its technical approach to the Offutt AFB project as described in the RFP. Jones Lang LaSalle will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Highest Ranking  Offeror (HRO) to the Air Force. The HRO will then begin negotiations with the Air Force and complete additional remaining submittal requirements needed for closing the real estate transaction.  These additional submittal requirements are also identified in the RFP. The Offutt Project is a real estate transaction to privatize 1,444 military family housing units. The objective of this initiative is to provide quality management for the 1,444 unit housing community for a lease period of at least 50 years. The Government will lease the land. The existing 2,600 housing units, primary and secondary associated utility and infrastructure systems, and other improvements will convey by Quitclaim Deed to the Project Owner (PO). The Government may subsidize the project's financing as described in the RFP. The PO will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the Offutt family housing inventory. Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the PO will be entitled to a portion of the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the PO. This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The Request for Proposal is available at http://www.jllpsc.com.

<OFFADD>Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Procurement and Property Management, 2 Massachusetts Avenue, NE, Room 1830, Washington, DC, 20212
<SUBJECT>B -- Employment and Hourly Compensation Costs for Manufacturing Workers in China
<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics intends to enter into a sole source contract under Simplified Acquisition Procedures with Judith Banister, Citicham Place, Building 16 Suite 21-A, Madian, Haidian District, Beijing 100088, China for further research of the available data for China on employment, wages, and components of additional compensation costs for the manufacturing sector for the period 1990-2002.  
The contractor shall prepare two Monthly Labor Review (hereinafter, MLR) articles.  The manuscripts for the articles shall be reorganized in the appropriate format for MLR articles and contain discussion of  additional research and sources.  
The article shall cover the People’s Republic of China, excluding Taiwan and the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong.  
The contractor shall identify areas where further research is needed.
Work Plan
The contractor shall base the two MLR articles partly on the final December report under the prior procurement and partly on additional research conducted under the current contract.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics shall provide the contractor with the following resources for use in this work:
1.  Summary notes, a transcript, and a DVD recording of the November 8 seminar at BLS.
2.  Comments from an expert in the area of international comparisons of compensation, to be delivered in February 2005.
3.  Guidelines for Monthly Labor Review authors and samples of international articles, including guidance and assistance in formatting charts and tables.

The contractor shall make contacts with the appropriate personnel at China’s National Statistical Office, Labor Ministry, Ministry of Agriculture, and State Administration of Industry and Commerce, in order to obtain the data and metadata (sources, methods, definitions, interpretations) needed for the follow up parts of the project.  
Key follow up questions include the following:
1.	Questions and suggestions raised in the discussants’ comments at the November 8 seminar that were not addressed in the December report, including raising of the following questions with the statistical authorities:
a.	Possible overlap between “urban” manufacturing employment and Township and Village Enterprise (TVE) employment.
b.	Time series on rural employment in urban units.
c.	Quality of TVE data and the possibility that employment figures are overstated.
d.	National Bureau of Statistics estimates of compensation for national accounts.
e.	Treatment of migrant workers in the employment and wage statistics.
2.	Availability and content of additional data sources, especially:
a.	 The labor force survey (are there data on hours of work, for example?). 
b.	Surveys of manufacturing in 8 major cities. 
c.	Any surveys similar to the 2002 survey by the Ministry of Labor that contained data on components of labor compensation.
The contractor shall also review and address comments from an expert on international wage and compensation issues engaged by BLS; these comments will be sent to the contractor no later than February.
Period of Performance  
The period of performance of the contract shall be from the date the procurement is issued to the contractor (preferably early January) to June 30, 2005.
The contractor shall keep the contracting officer’s technical representative (COTR) informed of work progress in informal monthly progress reports.
The final articles shall include but not be limited to discussion of the following topics, not necessarily in the order listed.
Manufacturing employment article:  
1.	Summary of results.
2.	Information about China’s statistical system and the role of the various statistical authorities in gathering data on manufacturing employment.
3.	Sources of statistics on manufacturing employment –surveys, censuses, administrative data, etc.
4.	Definitions and coverage of employment in the various sources, including changes in definition in 1998.
5.	Discussion of data discrepancies and weaknesses.
6.	Assessment of probably biases in the various statistical sources on the magnitude and trend in manufacturing employment.
7.	Discussion of rural to urban migration and the coverage (or lack thereof) of migrants in the statistics.
8.	Adjusted time series on manufacturing employment for 1990-2002.
9.	Conclusion, including future work that needs to be done and prospects for new sources of data.
Manufacturing wages and compensation article:  
1.	Summary of results.
2.	Introductory information referencing the employment article in the previous issue of the MLR and summarize points in that article that are also applicable to wages and compensation, such as the sources, urban focus of China’s statistics, data weaknesses, coverage of migrants.
3.	Sources of statistics on manufacturing wages and compensation that were not already described in the employment article.
4.	Process of moving from annual to monthly to hourly data calculations.
5.	Definition of wages and components of compensation covered in the statistics.
6.	Discussion of data discrepancies and weaknesses and probably biases that are particular to wages and compensation, such as underreporting of wages and reasons for this.
7.	Adjusted compensation data for 2002 for urban and rural employees and include time series for wages, but not compensation, for 1990-2002.  Explain why compensation cannot be calculated in a time series.
8.	Do not include PPP calculations; do not include section on “competitiveness of manufacturing industries in China,” except in a very summary way.
9.	Conclusion, including future work that needs to be done and prospects for new sources of data.

The total cost for this requirement is not to exceed $15,000.	  This notice of intent is not a request for offers.  A determination not to complete this proposed procurement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  There is no RFP notice.  For information purposes only.

<SUBJECT>D--Sole Source Extension
<DESC>The U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, Minerals Revenue Management, Lakewood, Colorado intends to award a modification to extend the period of performance of Contract Number  1435-02-99-CT-40315 for the project "COTS Financial System" with Accenture, LLP for one year.  The extended period of performance will be from October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007.  Accenture, LLP provides support for the automation of minerals royalty collection functions of MRM Financial Management, based on PeopleSoft and other software tools. Due to the scheduled expiration of support for existing software releases, the current contractor will be executing upgrades to PeopleSoft as well as integrating Sungard Entegrate software that supports MRM's Royalty in Kind activities.  Sensitive milestones in these tasks will coincide with the current expiration of the contract; thus the Minerals Management Service has determined that the risks of establishing a new contract during the software upgrade schedules would present an unacceptable risk of performance.  The Minerals Management Service will therefore delay the projected competitive award of a new contract, with a revised phase-in period now expected to begin on or about July 1, 2007.  This will allow completion and user acceptance of the systems prior to a new award.  This will also provide potential future offerors the opportunity to prepare proposals for a new solicitation with a presumption of entering into a contract during a time of relative stability after the software has been upgraded.  This proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by providing clear and convincing evidence of their ability to perform the services. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all information received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete the contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541519, and the size standard is $21,000,000.00. The Contracting Officer is Ms. Beverly Sechrest, who may be reached at 303-231-3935 or bev.c.sechrest@mms.gov.  In Ms. Sechrest's absence, you may contact Terry Grush, Chief of the Denver Procurement Branch, at 303-231-3931 or terry.grush@mms.gov.

Sites proposed by offerors as possible locations for the NSSC are: Brook Park, Ohio, Huntsville, Ala., and NASA's Stennis Space Center, Miss. NASA is creating a Shared Services Center to consolidate a variety of transactional and administrative activities being done at each NASA center in the functional areas of Human Resources, Information Technology, Procurement and Financial Management. The NSSC consolidates targeted activities into a separate NASA center, which reports to Headquarters. The NSSC is designed to achieve efficient and effective service; improved data quality; standardized processes; economies of scale, leveraged personnel skills and investments. The NSSC will work collaboratively with agency centers to meet their service needs via a contact center. This will allow NASA organizations to focus more time on their core work and strategic initiatives. Each NASA center will have a resident Customer Service Liaison to ensure timely and efficient service. NASA would like to take this opportunity to thank all the agency centers, community site partners and other participants for their patience, diligence and hard work in support of the NSSC site-selection process. The time and effort will go a long way in ensuring the success of the NSSC for NASA.  On September 13, 2004, NASA released the final Request for Proposal (RFP) for the NSSC. The RFP required potential offerors to select one of six approved locations for the NSSC. The RFP submission deadline was November 8, 2004. The final selection and award for the NSSC competition is scheduled for May 2005.

Offerors should provide references for other contracts and/or subcontracts for items of similar scope.  Projects cited and past performance references should be recent (within the last 2 years of the date of the quote).  The references should be limited to a brief description of the service provided, together with client points of contact (include email address and phone number of references).  Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services during the past three years.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The record of past performance, or the lack thereof, will be an important factor in the assessment of the risk involved in the quote.  Offerors must state whether they will be able to comply with the delivery requirements.
