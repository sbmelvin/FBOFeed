<DESC><p>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure supplies from the VPI Acquisition Co, LLC for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),&nbsp;Ship Rainier for a replacment&nbsp; HW boiler #2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BACKGROUND AND INTENT</p>
<p>The existing #2 boiler is original equipment to the vessel dating from 1967 and has many problems relating to the age of the boiler such as air leakage into the boiler casing which causes inefficient combustion, limits the firing level to less than the needed requirement to operate the distilling plant, and requires frequent maintenance. It is intended that boiler #2 be replaced with the same model boiler as was purchased to replace boiler #1 in 2005. Having both boilers that same simplifies maintenance and spare parts support and makes operation easier.</p>

<DESC>The U. S. Geological Survey, Geospatial Information Office has a requirement to obtain LiDar data that covers 2500 square miles of the "non-panhandle" portion of Lincoln County, WY.  USGS has the opportunity to obtain all this LiDar data at 18.75% of the cost of the entire project because other agencies and local governments will contribute the remaining funds for this project.  General specifications are as follows:"	Vertical Datum: NAVD88"	Titlting System: , ,  USGS quad"	Vertical Accuracy: 18cm"	Horizontal Accuracy: 1.4-meter 
The USGS interest is identified by the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI).  The WLCI is the priority project of the DOI Healthy Lands Initiative and involves study of the impact on wildlife and their habitats by the increasing land-use pressures in SW Wyoming (the Green River Basin ecosystem); more specifically, energy development.  An MOU among DOI (BLM and USGS), USDA (Forest Service) and the State of Wyoming (Wyoming Game and Fish Commission and Wyoming Dept. of Agriculture) is in place for the implementation of the Initiative.  The USGS has identified priority areas of study within the boundaries of the WLCI and has specified requirements for LiDAR. Some of this priority area falls within the boundaries of this project.
Based on information available at this time, the government considers the item specified as a sole source from Western Wyoming RC&D Council, Inc, PO Box 1761, Afton, WY 83110 and proposes to negotiate with that firm only.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and provide considerable cost sharing are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required item stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered a non-response to this request without further consideration.  Affirmative response shall be received by this office by close of business August 24, 2009 at 3:00 P.M. Mountain Standard Time.  This notice represents the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

The model and part-number for the requested components have been researched and they have been tested and proven as the overall best choice for the CAM. ELMA Electronic, Inc. is the only vendor that can provide the model and part-number for the requested components. This is a small purchase acquisition over $25,000.00. The delivery of the CompactPCI accessories/spares is required within 30 calendar days from the date of award.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address

Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, Suitland, MD Acquisition Division Room 3J444, Washington, DC 20233.

This is a notice of the U.S. Census Bureau’s intent to sole source pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.  This constitutes the only written notice, no other notice or solicitation shall be issued as a result of this notice.
The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541613 Marketing Consulting Services.  The potential contract value is $147,000.00.  The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is the nation’s economic accountant, producing measures such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), one of the most important statistical releases for its effect on financial markets.  BEA, as one of the world’s leading statistical agencies, collects source data, conducts research and analysis, develops and implements estimation methodologies and disseminates statistics to the public.  In this role, BEA collects source data from many specific sectors of the economy.  

The National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs) are used for a variety of purposes in setting national economic policy and in forecasting and interpreting macroeconomic activity.  They include the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is considered the most useful summary measure of the nation’s production.

It is important that BEA continually strives to develop new and improved source data to develop improved measures of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which is the largest component of the GDP.  A major initiative within BEA’s Strategic Plan 2008-2012 is to improve the PCE estimates by incorporating real-time scanner data.  

The U.S. CensusBureau is unable to provide BEA with a time series of sales data in this detailed format.  The annual and monthly retail sales surveys provide sales data by major industry, but not by product within industry.  The Economic Census provides more detail, but this survey is taken only once every five years.  Because these goods are sold by competing industries, the distribution of product sales by industry often changes quickly and substantially, making the information from the previous Economic Census data out of date.  

As a result, The Bureau of Economic Analysis has a requirement for detailed annual real-time electronic scanner data on retail sales of consumer electronic goods, software, appliances, home textiles, and home improvement items for the purpose of improving the estimation of PCE in the national accounts.
This data report must be provided in a consistent time series.  The data must come from a large, consistent, representative sample of retailers across the United States The data report must represent a significant share of the transactions in the major markets.  This data report must provide annual data on sales in dollars and in units (volume).  The data report must be at the sub-category (product) level, broken down by channel (industry).  

In addition, the data report must:

•	Provide retail numbers with a list of participating retailers, broken down by channel, for the calendar year.

•	Provide measures in both units and dollars.

•	Be delivered in the form of Microsoft Excel files.

•	Include consumer panel data, broken down by one or more retailers that include Walmart, Sam’s Club, and Costco, for consumer technology goods (e.g. televisions, audio equipment, computers) and Home goods.

•	Include annual data as follows:

o	 point-of-sale scanner data for software sales- Report Period: 2002-2005(raw form) 2005-2008 (projected)

THIS IS AN INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT PURSUANT TO FAR 6.302-1. THIS CONSTITUTES THE ONLY WRITTEN NOTICE, NO OTHER NOTICE OR SOLICITATION SHALL BE ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE. 
The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 511210 Software Publishers. The potential contract value is $170,000.00.  

BEA provides many economic measurements as part of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs).  The NIPAs are used for a variety of purposes in setting national economic policy and in forecasting and interpreting macroeconomic activity.  They include gross domestic product (GDP), which is considered the most useful summary measure of the Nation’s production.  BEA, as the nation’s accountant and one of the world’s leading statistical agencies, collects source data, conducts research and analysis, develops and implements estimation methodologies and disseminates statistics to the public.  In this role, BEA collects source data from many specific sectors of the economy.  

Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is responsible for obtaining a database containing health insurance claims records and statistical support to construct estimates that are statistically representative for spending by commercially insured patients. 

As a result, BEA has a requirement for a database containing health insurance claims records and statistical support to construct estimates that are statistically representative for spending by commercially-insured patients.

Specifically:

1.	The database must meet the following requirements:

•	Each year of data must contain a minimum of 3 million covered lives, to provide an acceptable degree of precision.
•	Cover a ten year period, beginning in 1998. 
•	Contain a sufficient number of patients (over 1 million covered lives) with prescription drug coverage for all time periods.
•	In each year the patients covered must be from a variety of regions, plan types, and demographic groups, to assist with the representativeness of the sample  
•	Claims data that include information on the patient (gender, age, geographic information on patient’s residence, and enrollment), ICD-9 codes for any diagnoses reported on the claim, CPT-4 codes for medical procedures, dollars received by the provider, type of provider, and information on the MEG disease category associated with the claim.    

•	 Contain computer algorithms that group individual claims data into disease categories to process the data with different episode grouping algorithms to assess the following:

a.	Sensitivity of the disease allocations and price indexes to choice of parameters
for the grouping algorithm, and

b.	  Sensitivity of the disease allocations and price indexes to the choice of grouper results using the MEG grouper will be compared to those obtained from the ETG grouper from Ingenix/Symmetry)

2.  The Contractor shall provide statistical support with the construction of weights for each patient in the dataset, such that estimates for population spending can be obtained from the sample; that is, weights that can be applied to obtain estimates representative of patients covered by commercial health insurance in the US.  
These weights must be constructed by the data vendor in order to exploit any variables observed by the vendor but not released in the sample (for example, detailed geographic information). 
The staff that will design the weights must have:
o	Familiarity with both the data set and potential frames for the construction of weights, 
o	Statisticians that are familiar with 1) statistical methods for constructing weights, 2) the sample claims database, and 3) BEA’s intended calculations on the data (price indexes).
o	Demonstrated experience with the construction of weights for their claims database.      
o	Demonstrated experience with the use of claims data for purposes of constructing price indexes.  
o	Demonstrated experience in both statistical weight and price index  required for creating an identifier for each patient in the database
o	Demonstrated experience with manipulating data that covers a ten-year period beginning in 1998.
o	Demonstrated experience with manipulating data that contains a minimum of three million patients at an acceptable degree of precision

3.     The Contractor shall construct 1) time series for dollars of spending by disease categories and 2) price deflators for various classes of diseases.  This work requires retrospective claims data that contains medical and pharmacy claims for a large number of beneficiaries.  

The place of performance shall be Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1441 L Street, NW, Washington, DC 20005. The period of performance is eighteen (18)  months from date of award. The government anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract using Part 15 Negotiated Competitive Procurement procedures. THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS OF ONLY ONE SOURCE: Thomson Healthcare, Inc. (Reuther), 5425 Hollister Avenue, Suite 140, Santa Barbara, CA 93111-2348.

As a result of analyzing responses to this synopsis of intent to sole source, the Contracting Officer may determine that the action may be competed.

DLAD 52.233-9000 AGENCY PROTESTS (SEP 1999)

Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the Contracting Officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity’s Chief of the Contracting Office.  Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an “Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979.”  (Note:  DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer’s decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer).  Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.
(End of Provision)

DLAD 52.233-9001 DISPUTES:  AGREEMENT TO USE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) (JUN 2001)

(a)  The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise.  If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute.  Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.

(b)  Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party.  The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1, or for the agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1).  Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the Contracting Officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate.

(c)  If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here (  ).  Alternate wording may be negotiated with the Contracting Officer.
(End of Provision)

3.  Offerors shall provide copies of the State of California Department of Health Services Environmental Laboratory Accreditations which demonstrate the offeror’s laboratory meets the required field of testing (attachment 2).  This certification will be used to determine technically acceptability.   All offerors at a minimum shall submit the laboratory certification number and the list of approved fields of testing.  If another laboratory (subcontractor) is being used to perform any of the sampling analysis, the above information must also be submitted for that laboratory.

4.  Offers shall provide an internet map search that shows the drive time from DDJC.

FAR 13-106-2 Evaluation of Quotations or Offers - The Government intends to evaluate quotes in response to this quotation and will award one firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror whose quote represents the lowest priced technically acceptable offer.

Price Evaluation:
Lowest priced will be evaluated on the overall lowest price for all CLINs.  Therefore, it is the responsibility of the offeror to quote on all CLINs.  If an offeror fails to quote on all CLINs, the Government is not required to contact the offeror for price and may deem the offeror non-responsive.

Technically Acceptability evaluation:
Factor 1 of 2:
Technically acceptability will be determined by the offeror’s proof of the current State of California Department of Health Services Environmental Laboratory Accreditations compared to attachment 2 - Required Contractor Lab Field of Testing.  The evaluation will be based on a Pass/Fail Basis.  Failure to submit a laboratory’s certificate number and list of approved fields of testing for each of the fields of test identified in attachment 2 of this solicitation which is required in performing sampling and analysis at DDJC may result in rejection of offer.

Factor 2 of 2: 
The Offeror shall be within in a two (2) hour driving time from DDJC.  This will be evaluated on a Pass/Fail basis where passing will be based on an internet mapping search provided by the offeror demonstrating their or the subcontractor laboratories are within the two-hour drive time.

All offers will first be evaluated for technically acceptability, and all offers with a “Pass” for technically acceptability will then be evaluated for price.

<DESC><p>Synopsis/Solicitation: <br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.
<p>Solicitation No. W912ES-09-T-0077 is being issued as a Request For Quote (RFQ) with the intent to award as a simplified acquisition. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32. This procurement is 100% set-aside for HUBZones located in the Counties in North Dakota included in the emergency declaration under the Stafford Act, Declaration number FEMA-1830DR. Quotes will not be accepted from firms in other counties or states. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 562111 (SIC 4953) with a size standard of $12.5M. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), St Paul District has a requirement for the removal of emergency levees placed for the protection of the Centennial Elementary School in Fargo, ND following the 2009 flooding event. It is estimated there are 6,200 cubic yards of clay to be removed from the existing levee. The 6,200 cubic yards figure is only an estimate and potential offerors are strongly encouraged to inspect the levee structure site location, stockpile site and disposal site, prior to providing a quote, to become familiar with the conditions and requirements associated with the removal and cleanup of the temporary clay and its stockpiling on the site and disposal at the I-29 and 64th Avenue South borrow pit and determine their own estimate for all clean up and quote accordingly. AWARD WILL BE A FIRM-FIXED-PRICE LUMP SUM FOR ALL WORK REQUIRED TO REMOVE AND DISPOSE OF THE CLAY PLACED ON THE LEVEE LOCATED AT THE CENTENNIAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND DESIGNATED IN THE MAPS SUPPLIED. THESE MAPS ARE INCLUDED AS ATTACHMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION AND ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES PRIOR TO SUBMISSION OF QUOTES. YOUR QUOTED PRICE SHALL INCLUDE ALL TIPPING FEES, WEIGHING COSTS, AND ANY OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DISPOSAL OF REMOVED MATERIAL. <br />This procurement may be bid as follows:</p>

<p>UNIT PRICE __________</p>
<p>TOTAL PRICE ____________</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>1. General. The work of this contract consists of providing all labor, equipment and materials necessary for the removal and proper disposal of emergency clay levees constructed during the spring 2009 flood fight in Cass County, ND at the Fargo School District #1, Centennial Elementary School as shown in Attachment 1. The contracting officer for this project is James Roloff at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Saint Paul District office. His phone number is 651-290-5414. Any changes or amendments or modifications to the contract must be approved in writing by the contracting officer.</p>
<p>2. Location of Work. Clay material placed on top of the existing permanent levee at the Fargo Centennial Elementary School beginning at the northwest corner of the school property near 40th Avenue South, and continuing south and then east along approximately 2,200 lineal feet of the permanent levee to a point just west of 25th Street South. A small amount of temporary clay material was also placed on pre-existing ground to extend the length of the permanent levee for a short distance at each of its ends near 40th Avenue South and 25th Street South. Specific removal locations are as shown in Attachment 1.</p>
<p>3. Emergency Levee Removal. Removals shall be limited to the materials placed during the 2009 flood fight. At the Centennial Elementary School in Fargo the levee is a pre-existing permanent levee. Additional clay material was added to raise the height of this levee by 2 to 3 feet and to extend its length for a short distance at each end during the flood fight. The contractor will remove these temporary clay materials down to the pre-existing permanent levee grass surface along the entire length of the levee and down to the pre-existing ground level for the levee extensions at each end. This interface will be readily identified as the pre-existing layer of grass (now dead) that was not removed prior to placement of the temporary clay material. The contractor will exercise care not to remove the topsoil underlying this layer of dead grass. Clay shall be disposed of as described in paragraphs 4 and 5, below. To assist the contractor the topography of the pre-existing permanent levee is shown in Attachment 2 (Centennial School Dike - Grading and Underground Utilities Plan_31July97.pdf), while recent topography of the temporary 2009 clay levee is shown in Attachment 3 (Centennial School Topographic Survey_25Jun09.pdf). The contractor shall be responsible for determining their own removal quantities to be used in bidding.</p>
<p>The contractor is required to conduct and schedule work operations to minimize impact to the adjacent property owners. The contractor shall exercise caution and not cause further damage to property by utilizing appropriate low earth pressure equipment to eliminate such damage. The contractor will exercise caution and care to not damage pre-existing retaining walls, storm drainage features and underground utilities that may be covered by the temporary clay materials. Attachment 2 provides the July 31, 1997 "Grading and Underground Utilities Plan" for the Centennial School to assist the contractor in avoiding damage to these areas. The contractor will be responsible for restoring any areas damaged by operations under this contract as well as filling holes and depressions adjacent to the levees, which occurred as a result of the placement of the emergency levees, with readily available material (temporary levee fill, clay, dirt, sand, etc). The contractor shall ensure the site is left in a state to minimize hazards to the public. The contractor will not be required to reestablish topsoil and turf.</p>
<p>No work will be permitted when the levee or work site is wet or when it is raining, as determined by the COR.</p>
<p>4. Mandatory Material Placement Locations. The temporary clay material removed from the permanent levee shall first be stockpiled on the soccer field near the northwest corner of the school property (see Attachment 1) until an estimated volume of 2,600 cubic yards (CY), as verified by the COR or designated representative, has been stockpiled. This material will later be used for modifications to the permanent levee under a separate contract by the School District, following completion of this contract. Clay material removed that is excess to the stockpile need will be disposed of at the City of Fargo borrow pit at I-29 and 64th Avenue South, as shown in Attachment 1.</p>
<p>5. Disposal Area Placement Requirements. The clay material stockpiled at the school soccer field shall be placed in 24 inch layers and graded to drain. There is no compaction or testing requirement for placement of this clay stockpile. There is also no requirement for stripping back sod and topsoil, prior to placement of the stockpile, as this was the site of a former borrow pit used in the 2009 flood fight in Fargo that was restored, except for topsoil and seeding. The School District intends to restore the topsoil and grass in this area as a part of their separate contract to modify the permanent levee, following completion of this contract. Excess clay material disposed of at the City of Fargo borrow pit at I-29 and 64th Avenue South shall be placed in 24 inch layers to fill the borrow pit uniformly to the extent possible with the volume of excess clay material available from the Centennial Elementary School site. There is no compaction or testing requirement for placement of clay in this borrow pit. Prior to the placement of fill in this borrow pit, any existing water in the pit shall be pumped out.</p>
<p>6. Erosion and Sediment Controls. The contractor shall be responsible for providing erosion and sediment control measures in accordance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The contractor is also responsible for obtaining and complying with any required permits. The erosion and sediment controls selected and maintained by the contractor shall be such that water quality standards are not violated as a result of the contractor's activities. The contractor shall implement temporary erosion and sediment control best management practices (BMPs). BMPs may include, but not be limited to, silt fences, sediment traps, and inlet and outfall protection. The contractor shall implement satisfactory BMPs (e.g. hay bales, etc) where water is pumped from the borrow pit to contain any sediments that may be pumped from the pit. The contractor will ensure that the pumped water does discharge directly into a water of the U.S. or into a storm drain, etc.</p>
<p>7. Clean-up / Restoration. The contractor shall be responsible for clean-up of all work areas, including but not limited to curb to curb surface cleaning, sweeping of sidewalks, and raking of boulevards. The sites shall be left in a state that minimizes hazard to the public. Any dirt or mud which is tracked onto paved roadways shall be cleaned.</p>
<p>8. Site Inspection. Maps of the location of the Centennial Elementary School permanent levee structure, stockpile site and excess clay materials disposal site are included in the Solicitation document under Attachment 1. Each prospective contractor should inspect the levee structure site location, stockpile site and disposal site, prior to providing a quote, to become familiar with the conditions and requirements associated with the removal and cleanup of the temporary clay and its stockpiling on the site and disposal at the I-29 and 64th Avenue South borrow pit. Unfamiliarity with the levee, the site, access restrictions or stockpiling and disposal requirements will not be cause for a change to the contract price or schedule. The estimated measurements and/or quantities on the attached maps are for reference only. The contractor has the sole responsibility of verifying measurements and quantity estimates prior to submitting a quote or offer.</p>
<p>9. Work Schedule. The contractor shall commence mobilization immediately upon issuance of purchase order and notice to proceed. The contractor will perform in accordance with the purchase order in all designated work areas established therein. The contractor will provide a sufficient number of crews to commence temporary levee removal operations within 48 hours of issuance of purchase order and notice to proceed. The contractor shall work 12 hours per day during daylight hours only, seven days per week. The contractor shall assign adequate resources to complete all work under the contract within 7 calendar days after receiving the Notice to Proceed.</p>
<p>10. Meetings. After a purchase order has been issued, the contractor shall attend a pre-work conference with the COR at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers office in Fargo, ND within 24 hours of issuance of the purchase order and notice to proceed. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss work hours, schedule, safety, scope of work, and to review other contract requirements.</p>
<p>11. Equipment. All trucks and equipment must be in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations. Frameless dump trailers are not acceptable. Truck loading shall comply with state, local, and Department of Transportation rules and regulations including weight limitations and the covering of truckloads.</p>
