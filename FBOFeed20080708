<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13) with GAMBRO Renal Products, 14143 Denver West Parkway, Lakewood, CO, 80401, as the only source that can provide a Hemofiltration Unit with both Continuous Veno-venous Hemofiltration (CVVH) and Hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) capabilities using sterile fluids.  This Hemofiltration Unit will be used in conjunction with the already existing facility dialysis equipment.  Providing an additional hemofiltration unit from any other manufacturer would result in a significant increase in the probability of a mistake due to incorrect operation, setup, and/or control of the equipment, which would increase the risk for injury and mortality.  Lastly, the requested Hemofiltration Unit will require no additional training of technicians or staff.  Specifically, the contractor shall provide:

- PRISMAFLEX System (Part #6023014700, Quantity 1 each)

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures (IAW FAR 13).  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 339112 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received within 15 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment to Shannon Lertora at shannon.lertora@med.navy.mil.  Statements are due by COB 23 July 2008.  No phone calls accepted.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY
Program Title: AT-SAT (Air Traffic Selection and Training) Test Administration FAA POC: Renee' GaudreauOrganization:  AJA-482Region:  FAA Headquarters Phone number:  (202) 267-7851Date:  July 8, 2008
BACKGROUND / SCOPE OF WORK: 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking services for the administration of the FAA's computer-based entry-level employment examination entitled "Air Traffic-Selection and Training" (AT-SAT).  This examination is used as part of the selection process for new en route and terminal air traffic controllers.The number of individuals to be tested each year is expected to vary.  The required maximum number of tests to be administered per year may be up to 16,100.  This number will ensure that there will be enough well qualified applicants in the hiring pool.  This figure was derived by multiplying the number of examinees from the most recent job announcement to recruit from the general public, multiplying that by an estimate of four public job announcements per year, and adding the number of potential Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative (AT-CTI) examinees per year.The Contractor may, at the direction of the FAA, be required to give the examination anywhere in the United States, its territories, or possessions at any time.  For example, the Contractor must be able to test in Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and all 50 states.  It is possible that the FAA will have testing needs in American Samoa and Nantucket Island.  It should be noted that past experience has shown that a single test site per state would not have been sufficient to meet past testing requirements in larger states such as Texas, New York, California, and Florida.  Additionally, the Contractor may be required to test in communities where there are AT-CTI schools.  The number of CTI schools is subject to change.  See attached Draft SOW for further detail.  
MARKET SURVEY PURPOSE:  
The purpose of this market survey is to inform industry of this requirement and to obtain comment on the attached Draft SOW.  Interested sources must respond with information to confirm evidence of their qualifications and capabilities to meet requirements in the attached Scope of Work. Responses to this market survey will be used to develop the Source List to be used when the solicitation for this requirement is issued, and will be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB/8(a)), Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, or full and open competition. This survey is being conducted in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for a portable Raman spectroscopy PhAT system with a785-nm excitation wavelength probehead, and a 17" working distance, visible (532 nmwavelength) noncontact optic for the NASA LaRC-owned microprobe RXN dispersive Ramanspectroscopy system. The portable Raman spectroscopy PhAT system is a state-of-the-artinstrument that will enable the successful attainment of project milestones for severalongoing NASA programs.	 NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Kaiser Optical Systems, Inc., who is theonly known source capable of providing this unique Raman spectroscopy PhAT system.  ThisPhAT system can utilize an existing Kaiser Invictus 785-nm laser currently owned byNASA-LaRC (part of the RXN Raman system).  The modular design, data acquisition softwareof the PhAT system allows for the compatibility of physical components and theinterchange of data files between the PhAT and RXN Raman systems.  Kaiser Optical Systemis the manufacturer of the proprietary equipment and is the only vendor that supplies thespectroscopy that properly connects with the existing hardware and interfaces with thesoftware features of the currently owned Raman spectroscopy system.  It would takesubstantial time and Government resources for another company to develop a similarproduct and revise all the interfaces to match up with the current system, which is notexpected to be recovered through competition.  Sole Source authority is FAR 13.106. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon July 14, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit written questions and responses to Government questions via email prior to the conference.<BR>Industry Day conference questions and responses to Government questions should be submitted via email to: <BR>To	CPT Theresa Glasgow  Contracting Officer<BR>Email	Theresa.Glasgow@us.army.mil<BR>Email Subject Line	Questions for HCP Net Industry Day Conference<BR>Due Date 	16 July 2008<BR>Time	4:00 pm Eastern Standard Time<BR><BR>To the extent possible, the Government will furnish a set of the submitted emailed Industry Day questions their answers, without attribution, either at the conference and/or shortly thereafter via email. <BR>To the extent possible at the actual Industry Day, the Government will record and transcribe questions and answers. The Government intends to make this information available, as time permits, at a future date.<BR>The Government will notify attendees in the event of any time or date changes.<BR>Background<BR>As part of the lead acquisition process, the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Command (USMEPCOM) processes applicants for the Armed Forces of the United States to establish the health and fitness of the individuals. The National Guard currently uses USMEPCOM (www.mepcom.army.mil) run facilities known as Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) for physical evaluation of 70,000 Army National Guard applicants annually and approximately 342,000 physical examinations annually for all services.  <BR>At these MEPS, new recruits receive physical examinations including age and gender appropriate lab work per Army Regulation 40-501 and DODI 6130.4. There are 65 MEPS located throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.<BR>Eight states have no MEP stations, and in other locations, the MEP stations are not close enough to prevent, new recruits from traveling long distances. Long travel distances and other inconveniences delay or even prevent applicants from obtaining timely accession physicals. This inefficiency accounts for numerous lost person-hours and financial costs to the Government.  <BR>National Guard Bureau (NGB) seeks to mitigate this situation by providing an option to obtain an accession physical examination outside of MEPS in the local community where the applicant resides. <BR>Physical Examinations typically consist of the following or additional activities. <BR>Height and weight measurements <BR>Hearing and vision examinations <BR>Urine and blood tests <BR>Drug and alcohol tests <BR>Muscle group and joint maneuvers<BR>Complete physical examination and interview <BR>Specialized test if required <BR>Pregnancy test for women<BR>Tattoos and scar documentation<BR>Consults<BR>Diagnoses and International Classification of Diseases 10 (ICD-10)<BR>Scope<BR>As part of the lead acquisition process, the ARNG requires a geographically dispersed nationwide Health Care Provider (HCP) services network (HCPNet) for Army National Guard accession and other types of physical evaluations enabling ARNG customers to obtain services in close proximity of their local, hometown community. The ARNG HCPNet customers are potential soldiers, active and Guard soldiers, and Special Forces candidates. In addition to accession physical examinations, the National Guard Bureau requires periodic physical examinations for active and Guard soldiers medical specialty consultations, and Special Forces physical examinations. In addition at a future date, and at the Governments discretion, the Government may permit other military services to participate in the HCPNet program. Should such a need arise; the Government will issue separate task orders, which will establish the requirements and regulations unique to the services involved. <BR>The current system requires accession physicals be performed at MEP stations. To enhance the functionality of the current system, the ARNG goal is for the HCPNet program to provide customers physicals and testing services within a 50 miles radius of where they reside throughout the 50 states, District of Columbia, possibly three US territories. Maximum flexibility in location and availability of customer appointment scheduling times are extremely important to the success of the award. It is also important that the HCPNet contractor provide adequate geographical coverage of the 50 states, District of Columbia, possibly three US territories. <BR>Components of the Recruiting and Retention Contract Physician Program <BR>The Army National Guard Recruiting and Retention Contract Physician Program has three components. The first component is the Health Care Provider Network, which is the objective of this solicitation. This component schedules and provides physicals to National Guard customers for the 50 states, District of Columbia, possibly three US territories. The other two are the Compliant IT Infrastructure Component and the 1800GoGuard Component.<BR>The compliant IT Infrastructure (ITI) is the repository for program medical and other data from all HCPNet contractors; it also includes a recruits pre-screening and medical history data from the 1800GoGuard website. It supports for the National Guard Medical Review Board qualification decisions. The 1800GoGuard recruiting website component (www.1800GoGuard.com) is the National Guards new technology face to potential recruits and their influencers and it emerging as an effective platform for recruiting activities and promoting relationships between potential recruits and recruiters. The 1800GoGuard website assists recruits prepare prescreening data, and in the future, schedule appointments with HCPNet providers.<BR>Implementation Concept <BR>The Government intends to have an HCPNet Pilot proof of concept demonstration task, involving all contract awardees, immediately following contract award. After a successful proof of concept, the Government intends to issue individual awardees a Phase I task order to prove they can meet HCPNet requirement by demonstrating HCPNet capabilities as defined in this PWS. <BR>The Government intends issue Phase II task order to offerors successfully completing Phase I. Phase II is the full implementation of the geographical distributed network of HCPs to schedule appointments, to perform required physicals, and to capture and transmitted required medical and other data.<BR>Initially, at the discretion of the Government, the Government will issue Pilot task orders to one or more selected awardees, who are the pathfinders. The other awardees are the collaborators. The objective for pathfinders is to demonstrate proof of concept for the required HCPNet operational capabilities.<BR>All awards have potentially two phases, each implemented by task order. A task order for Phase 1 requires Offerors to demonstrate HCPNet required capabilities in a limited geographic area. A task order for Phase 2 requires Offerors to provide a geographically dispersed network of HCP services to all or part of the 50 states, District of Columbia, possibly three US territories.<BR>The government intends to issue a Phase 1 task order to all awardees that actively participate in the Pilot effort, although not at the same time. The government intends to issue a Phase 2 task order only to Offerors who successfully complete Phase 1.<BR>With the exception of the Pilot effort, the Government does not intend to issue task orders to all Offerors at the same time. Rather, the Government reserves the right to issue task orders in a time sequential manner to be determined at the Governments discretion consistent with the Government IT infrastructure capabilities, customer demand, Government program office operations, and desired geographical services coverage. Task orders are subject to conditions described above as well as geographical coverage or other customer needs.  <BR>Contract Type<BR>This acquisition will be a multiple award Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.<BR>Place of Performance <BR>The offeror shall provide HCPNet services to all or part of the 50 states, District of Columbia, possibly three US territories. <BR>Period of Performance <BR>The Base Contract will run for twelve months from award date with four option years. The Government will issue Pilot Proof of Concept Demonstration Task orders upon contract award in the base year. The duration of the Pilot tasks is dependent upon offerors proposals. The Government intends to issue Phase I task orders following successful completion of the demonstration tasks. The duration of an offerors Phase I task depends on the offerors proposal and staffing. The Government intends to issue Phase II task order when an offeror successfully Phase I. <BR>Specific Tasks <BR>The HCPNet contractors responsibilities are the following.<BR>Network of Health Care Providers <BR>Complete Physical Examinations <BR>The contractor shall perform the required complete physical examinations at geographically distributed locations over the 50 states, District of Columbia, possibly three US territories.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  
It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to issue a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Affymetrix, Inc. 3420 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95051, to provide human and dog single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping chips and it’s mapping kits.  The human SNP contains 250,000 SNPs on each chip from various genes in human chromosome. This allows the opportunity to obtain 4 million genotypes per day through the microarray core facility. The dog SNP contains 100,000 SNPs on each chip from various genes in dog genome.  This allows for obtaining 1.6 million genotypes per day through the microarray core facility.  The dog SNP is needed to do whole genome wide association studies to map behavior genes in dog by comparing samples from various breeds in different groups. The objective is to find canine candidate genes responsible for bladder cancer in certain breeds or populations. The human SNP will be used to produce mass amounts of genotype data over a short period of time. This will then be used to find candidate genes responsible for prostate and kidney cancer.  The sole source determination is based upon the fact that theAffymetrix array set has a higher number of SNPs on each chip allowing for higher density scan than what is available from other chips. Also, these chips are the only chips compatible with the equipment in the National Human Genome Research Institute Core facility. NHGRI has a microarray core facility with all of the necessary hardware, equipment, and reagents in stock. They have optimized the protocol and perfected the method for running the assays. Purchasing only the SNP chips with the labeling kits, and utilizing NHGRI’s core facility will provide a cost savings to the government that can not be recovered through competition. Awarding to another vendor would result in substantial duplication of unnecessary cost.

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541712 and the Size Standard is 500 employees.  The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR part 6, Competition Requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. 

Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this notice.  All responses should include a firm fixed price; documentation of the capabilities of meeting the government requirements; at least three references documenting successful past performance in meeting Government minimum specifications; a proposed delivery schedule; prompt payment discount terms; the DUN & Bradstreet number (DUNS); the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN); and the offeror’s business size.  The submission will be evaluated on the content of the above documents.  The offeror must also register in the Government’s Contractor Registry System, Note: www.ccr.gov.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurements.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration, a bureau of the U.S. Department of Commerce, is interested in obtaining the services of a vessel and captain to transport scientists to conduct a reconnaissance in the upper Aleutian Islands in the vicinity of Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. Since the mid-1800's NOAA's National Ocean Service (NOS) Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) and its predecessors have been collecting tidal current information to maintain and update the predictions in U.S. Tidal Current Tables. Mariners rely on this information to plan for safe and efficient maritime transportation. Every year CO-OPS deploys around 70 current meters in several locations around the country. In 2010, CO-OPS will be measuring tidal currents in the upper Aleutian Islands in the vicinity of Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. In the summer 2008, CO-OPS plans to do a reconnaissance of these locations. Reconnaissance includes determining the latitude, longitude and depth of the proposed locations; taking a bottom grab sample to identify bottom type; measuring salinity and temperature; and determining obstructions/hazards to deploying current meters in these locations.
<p>To conduct this reconnaissance work, NOAA seeks the services of a vessel, captain and crew to be available in mid-to-late August, 2008.</p>

Title of Project:  Arkansas River Shiner Presence/Absence Survey, Lake Meredith National Recreation Area
Description:  Lake Meredith National Recreation Area (NRA) has initiated planning for an Off-Road Vehicle Management Plan (ORV)/ EIS and Rulemaking.  Currently there are two ORV areas in the park, Blue Creek and Rosita.  The Canadian River, potential habitat for the endangered Arkansas River Shiner, runs through the Rosita ORV area.  While some sampling has been done for areas surrounding the NRA, no current Arkansas River Shiner data is available.  As part of the planning process, the NRA is collecting information about the affected environment of the park, including the presence or absence of the Arkansas River Shiner. The primary purpose of this fish sampling is to document the presence of Arkansas River Shiner and other incidental fish species in the Lake Meredith National Recreation Area, and specifically in the Rosita ORV area.  Under a separate contract, the Government is in the process of preparing the ORV Plan/ EIS.  Information collected as part of this survey will be included in the analysis of this ORV Plan/ EIS.  The Contractor shall sample for the presence of the Arkansas River Shiner.  The Contractor shall sample for the Arkansas River Shiner once during all four seasons of the year.  The Contractor shall determine when, during those seasons, sampling would be most appropriate.  The sampling locations will be determined and documented by the contractor based upon the river flows at the time of each sample.  The River flow fluctuates with the season, and it often occurs not as a visible flowing stream, but as individual pools of water which are fed from below-ground flows.  The expectation is that the sampling would occur at equal numbers of "riffles" and "pools" in the Canadian River, between Chicken Creek and Texas Highway 287.   Riffles and pools shall be sampled, if the River is actually flowing.  If the river is not flowing, individual pools shall be sampled.  The Contractor shall determine how many areas to sample based on the best available science on the Arkansas River Shiner.  The expected methods for the sampling are fish seining.  The Contractor shall deliver a summary report of the sampling efforts, procedures, and results. A seasonal report is expected to document the result of each season.  
Period of Performance:  The sampling is expected to begin in late summer of 2008.  Final deliverables are to be completed no later than February 1, 2010.
Type of Procurement: A negotiated sole source, fixed price contract is anticipated.

STATEMENT OF WORK
 Yavapai Point MuseumClimate Change Exhibit and Exhibit Modification

I. BACKGROUNDNew geology exhibits were installed, May 2007 in Yavapai Point Museum (Yavapai Observation Station), located on the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona. The Station is one of the first museums in the National Park Service and provides spectacular views of the canyon. The new exhibits provide an introduction to Grand Canyon geology, and help visitors understand the landscape they experience as they explore the park.
The Station is relatively small and must regularly accommodate large numbers of visitors.  The average visitation is between 6,000-10,000 visitors per day.  Any exhibits must be made to with stand extremely heavy use.
In addition to the recently installed geology exhibits, a small climate change exhibit needs to be planned, designed and fabricated.  Modifications need to be made to two interactive exhibits, to better meet the visitor's understanding of geology and withstand the high level of use.  Also, to accommodate visitors' interest in the landscape four open top boxes will be installed to hold binoculars tethered in place.  
II. PURPOSEThe purpose of this contract is to provide:1.	Climate change exhibit - Provide planning, design and fabrication for a climate change exhibit.2.	Supergroup interactive - Provide a new more durable design and fabricate an improved Supergroup interactive. 3.	Paleozoic interactive - Provide design and fabricate a new interactive for the Paleozoic panel window.4.	Binocular boxes - Build four boxes to hold binocular tethered in place and mounted on the existing parapet. 
 The exhibits will be transported to the site, and installed.
Work includes coordination with the park staff (Interpretive Specialist) to integrate the climate change exhibit design with the existing exhibit design.  The two interactive exhibits must meet the goals set forth in the original design plan and documents.  However new ideas are needed to meet these goals.
In addition, content development for the climate change exhibit will be coordinated with the park's Interpretive Specialist and Air Quality Specialist.  Additional research and information gathering may be necessary to complete the design of the exhibit elements. 


III. SCOPE OF WORKIndependently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide all services including labor, materials, facilities, and travel (except as otherwise specified in this contract) necessary to detail, fabricate, transport to the site, and install all exhibit elements for the Yavapai Point Museum, Grand Canyon National Park, Grand Canyon, Arizona.
The Contractor shall plan and design the climate change exhibit and additional exhibit modification to a set budget for both planning, design and production. 
Work under this order shall proceed according the following:  1.	National Park Service Standard Exhibit Planning and Design Specifications dated January 31, 2008 2.	Section C, Description/Specifications/Work Statement, including National Park Service Standard Exhibit Fabrication Specifications dated December 2006,  
1.	Climate Change ExhibitThe climate change exhibit needs to be planned, designed, fabricated and installed in Yavapai Point museum.  In the development of the exhibit existing design criteria needs to be followed so the new exhibit blends seamlessly with the other exhibits.  See attached photographs for the space that the exhibit will be placed in the museum and samples of the other exhibits
2 .  Supergroup InteractiveThe current interactive on the reader rail of the Supergroup exhibit is broken and has proved not to be successful in visitors' understanding of  "A Continent spreads Out - As the supercontinent Rodinia split into smaller continents the layers of Supergroup Rocks fractured, moved, and tilted."  The interactive exhibit needs to be redesigned to fit the existing space.  Contractor will need to evaluate how the current exhibit can be removed and a new one installed without impacting the reader rail that holds the exhibit.  See attached photographs.
3.  Paleozoic InteractiveThe existing monitor with a very brief illustration of seas transgressing and regressing is poorly done and visitors' lack understanding to what is happening.  This exhibit needs to be replaced with something more dynamic that will illustrate the text: "Paleozoic Rocks: A Quiet Continental Edge - A sun beat down as North America drifted across the equator 525 million years ago.  The Grand Canyon region was a costal plain broken by isolated ridges of Supergroup Rocks.  The western sea advanced across this, depositing the beginnings of the Paleozoic Rock set. The variety of Paleozoic Rocks represents constantly changing marine and terrestrial environments created by the rising and falling seal levels. The environments were home to may plants and animals.  The diverse colors, textures and fossils in the rock layers reflect the complexities of these evolving environments. This pattern of deposition ended as a new super continent took shape 270 million years age."There is flexibility in using the framed opening in which the monitor screen fits as a window to look into the past.  There is space behind the exhibit to build a movable box or some other type of interactive.  See attached photographs
4. Binocular boxes - build four boxes with attached tether to hold binoculars.  The boxes will be made out of Dupont Corian, color, canyon and mounted securely to the parapet.

<DESC>The Atlantic Test Range (ATR), Aircraft Signature and Avionics Measurement (ASAM) Branch,  Patuxent River MD has a requirement for an upgrade of its Multiple-Target Radar (MIR) Pedestal Subsystem Electronics. The MIR is a unique ‘one-of-a-kind’ radar system manufactured by Raytheon Co for NAVAIR during the 1970’s. The pedestal subsystem of the MIR radar was designed and manufactured by Scientific-Atlanta in the mid-1970’s. The upgrade shall include all the electronic, electro-mechanical and electrical components of the MIR pedestal servo system and replacement of all wiring and cables interfacing such equipment, as well as, inspection and lubrication of mechanical assemblies pertaining to the rotation of the MIR pedestal shall be accomplished. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on an other than full and open competitive basis with ViaSat, Inc., 1725 Breckinridge Plaza, Duluth GA 30096-8982 under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other services or supplies will satisfy the agency requirements.    Scientific-Atlanta, who designed and manufactured the MIR pedestal subsystem was acquired by ViaSat in 2000, therefore, ViaSat represents the corporate knowledge of  the MIR pedestal system. In addition, due to the unique ‘one-of-a-kind’ nature of the MIR pedestal and the special re-use requirements (interfacing to mechanical assemblies, encoder package, and Multiple Instrument Pedestal System (MIPS) compatibility), only ViaSat is capable of fulfilling this requirement.  Interested parties may submit a capabilities statement in which to identify their interest and capability.  To be eligible for contract award or payment by any Department of Defense activity, offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, see http://www.ccr.gov.

Technical capability will be determined solely on the content and merit of the information submitted in response to this provision. Therefore, it is incumbent on the interested party to provide sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc. in order for the Government to make an adequate technical assessment of the proposal.  The Government reserves the right to process the procurement on a sole source basis based upon the responses received.  The Government will not pay for any information received.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for construction services for the renovation of existing cafeteria space into a conference center at the Harold Washington Social Security Center located at 600 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois.  The procurement will be issued as a lump sum, firm fixed-price contract open to all business concerns in accordance with the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program. The estimated total construction cost for the project falls within the range of $1,000,000 to $5,000,000, with an anticipated project duration of approximately 10 months.  

The project scope consists of the demolition of existing kitchen and food service area’s finishes, partitions, equipment, and remaining building systems as well as the construction of new metal stud and drywall partitions and both hard and lay-in ceilings. All of the mechanical, electrical, telecommunications/data, plumbing, and fire protection systems will be new and tie into the existing building systems.

The “best value trade-off process” will be utilized in this procurement for the evaluation of offers and the selection of the successful Offeror to receive the award.  The Government will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of both the technical factors and the total evaluated price.  For this procurement, the technical factors will be significantly more important than price.  The technical factors will include past experience on similar projects, past performance on similar projects, qualifications and experience of key personnel and project management plan.    

Small Business Participation:  In accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, this procurement is unrestricted and is therefore open to both large and small business concerns. Although this procurement is open to large business, small businesses are encouraged to participate. In accordance with Public Law 95-507, the offeror will be required to provide the maximum practicable opportunities for small, disadvantaged, veteran owned, service disabled veteran owned and HUBZone businesses through subcontracting opportunities.  In the event a large business (small businesses are not subject to this requirement) is the awardee, an acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by SBA prior to award of this contract. Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to have participation from small, small disadvantaged, small woman-owned, small HUBZone and small veteran-owned business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is 236220 with a size standard of $31 million.  

Joint Ventures:  Joint ventures or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality contractor team effort.

Interested Parties/How to Offer:  The solicitation package will only be available electronically and is anticipated to be available on or about July 24, 2008.  The solicitation package will be available on the FedBizOpps website, www.fbo.gov.  The offer due date and time for receipt of proposals will be on or about August 26, 2008 at 3:00 P.M.

Evaluation factors may consist of the following: (1) Technical Approach; (2) Previous Experience: (3) Past Performance; (4) Key Personnel, Teaming Arrangements, Management Plan.

A.	 General Information

NOTE:   THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS A COMPLETE REPLACEMENT FOR SOLICITATION NUMBER TMAR2-SS62.  ALL INTERESTED VENDORS MUST SUBMIT FOR THE FIRST TIME OR RE-SUBMIT THEIR RESPONSES REFERENCING THE NEW SOLICITATION REFERENCE NUMBER ASSIGNED TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  

The Tri-Service Mid-Atlantic Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, and Air Force medical commands and medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of Virginia and North Carolina announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of Pharmaceutical Containers to include, but not limited to:

   	1. Prescription Vials, Amber, Plastic, Reversible Child Resistant/Non-Child
	     resistant Caps to include 16, 30, 60, and 90 dram sizes
	   2. Pharmaceutical Bottles (with lids) available in multiple sizes to include 90,  
                   120, and 150 dram sizes
   3. Pharmaceutical Jars (with lids) available in multiple sizes to include 1, 2, 
       4, and 8 ounce sizes

The major facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Region include: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Hospital Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

    The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor) or the Pharmacy Prime Vendor (Amerisource Bergen).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP’s Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is July 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

Financial Operations Department, Bldg. 250
Naval Medical Center Portsmouth
620 John Paul Jones Circle
Portsmouth, VA  23708

Email responses must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST) on the specified closing date/time of this Sources Sought FBO Notice.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from participation in this standardization effort.

This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  

Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of 4:00 PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region will be digitally signed by the issuer. 

Emails and correspondence may be sent to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil .

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated 
below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed

For those companies that meet the requirements above and the criteria below under Technical/Company Criteria, the CPT will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting.

2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3) – Acceptable; Four (4) – Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

3.	After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the
clinical evaluation group who met the 3.00 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer representing a discount from their DAPA pricing based on a minimum committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for MTFs in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Vendors that fail to offer pricing that is discounted from their DAPA pricing will be eliminated from further consideration.  Vendor Product and Price Proposals will be in the Excel template provided by the government.  The vendors will provide their completed Excel template by email to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil.

Pricing responses must be received by 4:00 P.M. (EST) fourteen (14) calendar days from the date the request is initiated by the TRBO.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration

Technical/Company Criteria:

The CPT will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability.    All criteria are equally weighted.

a. In general, “acceptability” for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
(1) based on the vendor’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; and
(2) the vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of “technical acceptability.”  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion below, as required.

The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors must provide a response to each criterion listed below:

    ‘Usage items’ are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, 
     as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for 
     the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result 
     in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort

             a. At a minimum, a complete product line includes:

1. Prescription Vials, Amber, Plastic, Reversible Child Resistant/Non-Child
	      resistant Caps to include 16, 30, 60, and 90 dram sizes

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

The CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria are outlined below: 

1. The pharmaceutical vial/cap combination is durable.
	a. The pharmaceutical vial/cap combination must be able to withstand normal wear and
                tear encountered from filling the prescription to daily usage by the patient.
	b. This criterion will be evaluated by technician/clinician assessment when 
                handling the vial/cap during normal usage.
2. The conversion of the cap from “child resistant” to “easy open”, and visa versa, is easily
    accomplished.
	a. The ease of conversion is critical to promoting proper use of the cap by parents of 
                small children and for the ease of access to the medication by elderly and/or dexterity 
                challenged patients.
	b. The technician/clinician will evaluate this criterion by converting the cap from “child 
                resistant” to “easy open”, and visa versa.
3. The quality of the cap seal is sufficient to prevent accidental/unintentional opening of the vial.
	a. The pharmaceutical vial must remain securely closed to provide containment of the
                medication until access is required.
	b. To accomplish the evaluation of this criterion, the technician/clinician will fill the vial. 
                place the cap on, and shake the vial.
3. The exterior surface of the vial provides for secure adherence of a label.
	a. Correct identification of the contained medication form the label on the vial is essential
                to patient safety.
	b. The technician/clinician will evaluate this criterion by applying a standard 
                pharmaceutical label utilized by the facility to the vial and attempting to remove it.  
4. The pharmaceutical vials perform satisfactorily when used with robotic systems.
	a. Robotic systems allow the pharmacies to meet the clinician/patient demand for 
                prescription medication. The vials must be able to be utilized with minimal, or no, 
                process disruption.
b. The vials will be used with the robotic systems to evaluate this criterion.
 5. The Pharmaceutical Bottle is durable and the lid provides a satisfactory, secure seal.
	a. The bottle must be able to withstand normal wear and tear encountered from filling the 
                prescription to daily usage by the patient. 
	b. This criterion will be evaluated by technician/clinician assessment when 
                 handling the vial/cap during normal usage.
  6. The Pharmaceutical Jar is durable and the lid provides a satisfactory, secure seal.
	a. The jar must be able to withstand normal wear and tear encountered from filling the 
                prescription to daily usage by the patient. 
	b. This criterion will be evaluated by technician/clinician assessment when 
                handling the vial/cap during normal usage.

Vendor facilities for treatment and disposal must be privately owned and operated outside of areas managed by DOE and must have a mechanism for disposal of the final waste forms. Appropriate permits and authorizations obtained at vendor expense must be in place prior to treatment under the contract. The estimated amount of waste for which treatment is sought under this announcement is approximately 1180 cubic meters per year (average of last two calendar years) for an estimated 4 years. The wastes to be treated include bulk and non-bulk liquids, solids, sludge, debris, and particulate material. The wastes may also include asbestos, used oil, universal waste, aerosols, and cylinders of toxics, poisons, corrosives and freons. Many EPA waste codes and/or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may be associated with the waste. No radioactive components are associated with the waste. The wastes have been grouped based on EPA waste code, PCBs, physical and chemical properties, and/or potential known treatment process(es) to meet disposal standards. The treatment groups and estimated yearly waste volumes include universal waste (23 cubic meters); stabilization bulk and non-bulk (960 cubic meters) used oil - bulk and non-bulk (50 cubic meters); direct disposal - non-bulk (16 cubic meters); macroencapsulation - non-bulk (8 cubic meters), bulk (33 cubic meters); wastewater treatment - non-bulk (11 cubic meters); thermal treatment - non-bulk (35 cubic meters); PCB treatment - incineration, bulk and non-bulk (30 cubic meters); mercury treatment - retort, non-bulk (5 cubic meters); batteries - non-bulk (6 cubic meters); and specialty waste - non-bulk - dioxin wastes (1 cubic meters); reactive wastes - elemental sodium (2 cubic meters). Services to be contracted include transportation of the INL waste to an appropriate treatment/storage/disposal facility, performing any necessary sorting, processing the waste to meet applicable regulatory standards and requirements, any interim storage at the treatment facility, and transport and disposal of the treated product and any residuals in a permitted and authorized facility. The treated waste must meet all regulatory and other applicable requirements for disposal. <br /><br /><strong>This is a sources sought announcement designed to identify and qualify potential sources interested in this project</strong>.<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This announcement is not a solicitation</span></strong>. Vendors who submit a qualified response will be maintained on a list as sources for a possible future solicitation.

<p>Conceptual Design of an Interim Pretreatment System<br />Expected RFP Release Date: First Quarter, Fiscal Year 2009</p>
<p>CH2M Hill Hanford Group (CH2M HILL), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy Office of River Protection, is soliciting interest and information supporting pre-qualification of firms having the capability to perform the Conceptual Design of the Interim Pretreatment System (IPS). The conceptual design will include development of the alternative strategies that will satisfy the mission requirements. These alternative strategies will culminate in the proposed path forward for the project as documented in the Conceptual Design Report. DOE Order 430.3A "PROGRAM AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CAPITAL ASSETS" dated 7-28-06 identifies the requirements for the conceptual design process.</p>
<p>The IPS will treat high level radioactive waste from Hanford site double-shell tanks (DST) to remove solids and cesium to levels that will allow subsequent treatment in a low activity waste (LAW) vitrification facility. Crossflow filtration will be used as the first step to remove most undissolved solids from the incoming waste. The solids will be returned to the DST system and the filtered waste will be sent to the cesium removal process. A cesium-specific ion exchange resin will be used to selectively remove cesium from the filtered waste while leaving the remaining dissolved solids. The treated waste will be collected, sampled, and then pumped to the LAW vitrification facility. The ion exchange resin will be regenerated, removing the cesium, and reused. The cesium product will be returned to the DST system.</p>
<p>The IPS design will include the nuclear safety design requirements of DOE Order 420.1B, "FACILITY SAFETY". These include requirements for multiple barriers to prevent the release of radioactive materials and confinement of radioactive liquids, particulates and gases. In addition, shielding and other features will be required to keep exposures as low as reasonably achievable. The IPS design will also meet hazardous waste treatment environmental requirements.</p>

<DESC>This notice is issued by the NASA/HQ to solicit responses from interested parties.This document is for information and planning purposes only and to allow industry theopportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well aspromote competition.  Purpose NASA/HQ procurement is issuing a Request for Information (RFI), in support of NASA'sOffice of Infrastructure and Administration, to obtain industry responses on NASA'sproposed Property Inventory requirement.   This RFI is for planning purposes only.  NASAwill use the responses to determine whether to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) toprocure services from the private sector.  NASA intends to evaluate the price and missioneffectiveness of consolidating the property inventory function into one Agency-widecontract.  A description of the requirement is provided below.If an RFP is issued, it is contemplated to be released in Spring 2009, with awardprojected for FY2010, for a five year period of performance. The contemplated contractwould be awarded as a firm fixed price contract.  A single award will be made under the contemplated contract.  Description of Requirement NASA Centers are required to take a total equipment inventory every three years.Currently, each NASA Center conducts its own wall-to-wall physical inventories andproperty reconciliation at various times, using both civil service and contractorsupport. NASA is considering contracting for the performance and reconciliation of annual,national, physical inventories of accountable personal property at NASA Centers. Personalproperty is generally any property, except real property (lands, structures, buildings).Personal property consists of two major subgroups, controlled equipment and supplies.Controlled equipment is a subgroup of personal property that primarily consists ofproperty which is valued over $5000.00 and which has a useful life exceeding two years.It also includes lower value property deemed sensitive by the agency because of itssusceptibility to theft, or because it poses a threat to health, safety, the environmentor national security. The primary objective of a physical inventory is to verify the existence of all NASAcontrolled equipment on record, and to determine its current location. A second objectivewould include identification, tagging and reporting of all uncontrolled equipment whichotherwise meets the criteria for control specified in NASA Policy Requirement 4200.1F. It is expected that the contractor will perform five major activities in support of thephysical inventory and reconciliation. These include: (1) An actual scan of all equipment during the initial annual inventory and as planned insubsequent inventories; (2) Comparison of the results of the scanning with balances recorded on equipmentrecords; (3) Resolution of reported shortage discrepancies by rescanning when possible, within alimited time after completion of each segment of the inventory; (4) Automatic adjustments of the official equipment records.(5) Compilation and reporting of inventory actions, status and results in both detail andsummary form.To meet these major objectives, the contractor shall:Attend semi-annual pre and post briefings at NASA Headquarters (HQ), Washington D.C,Logistic Management Division (LMD), to discuss the inventory process and schedules.Develop an inventory plan and schedule for each center and submit to HQ at the beginningof each inventory cycle, typically on a calendar year basis. The plan should not belimited to conduct of a 100% inventory, but should include recommended inventory bestpractices that will reduce the overall cost of inventory performance while maintainingaccuracy and independence and minimizing risk of inaccuracy in property records.Ensure that the scanning equipment is compatible with NASA PP&E System, for downloadingand uploading inventory data.Ensure that a single individual be assigned to function as inventory supervisor to manageand control the inventory.Work with the NASA Center Supply and Equipment Managers (SEMO) to coordinate theinventory and resolve discrepancies.Provide the Center SEMO with a schedule for the inventory to allow for a minimum of 30days advance notification for each building to be inventoried. Schedule the inventory to minimize interruption to ongoing NASA laboratory, constructionand launch activities.	Ensure that the inventory team conducts the physical inventorydiscreetly and with minimal disturbance to the organization. Prior to entering a laboratory area, determine if inventory equipment or personnel mayaffect ongoing experiments. Also determine if laboratory activities may have adeleterious effect on inventory equipment.Provide transportation to and from each Center and accommodations for inventory team.Visit planned and scheduled locations at each Center, including contractor locations,scanning all equipment within those locations with a laser scanner.Ensure that equipment found during the inventory, be identified to the usingorganization, tagged, and recorded during the inventory using NASA Form 1618.Ensure that equipment on loan or lease from organizations outside the Center contain barcoded loan or lease tags, which will be identified or scanned as they are found withinthe inventory accounts. Identify and note equipment that appears to be excess, worn out, or in need of repair.Identify items of controlled equipment with obvious discrepant information such asincorrect serial numbers and descriptions. Correct information based on observation.Ensure that equipment that appears to be unused or underutilized be noted during theinventory and reported. Ensure that after completion of the scanning of a location, the inventory is signed anddated by the Inventory Supervisor and each team member.Produce inventory reconciliation reports for NASA Center property officials to documentinventory results, in particular inventory discrepancies and recommendations (e.g.write-off). These reports shall, at minimum, consist of the separate lists for:Missing items; Overages;Adjustments to inventory records as a result of the physical inventory requiring nofurther action, such as locations changed by scan;Adjustments to inventory records requiring further action such as:	Description	Serial NumberProgress in reduction of inventory shortage and overage discrepancies duringreconciliation;Unresolved discrepancies; Items reconciled without scanning, such as items on legitimate property pass, and,Inventory matchesInventory reports shall identify the individual performing the inventory, the time anddate of the inventory, the equipment item used to perform the inventory, and any manualentries.Ensure weekly and post survey meetings are scheduled, with the SEMO and other Centerofficials to assist with reconciliation of the missing equipment. Ensure that reconciliation and adjustments to the NASA PP&E System be accomplished priorto closing the overall agency level inventory, but no longer than 60 working days fromthe completion of each centers physical inventory. All reconciliation and adjustments tothe inventory will be supported by documentation. Ensure that a Physical Inventory and Reconciliation Summary Report for each Center, becompleted and submitted to the COTR/HQ-LMD and the SEMO, NLT 30 days after the completionof the inventory and reconciliation.  Each report must contain the following information:The name of the company conducting the inventory, inventory opening and closing dates,date of report, and the general findings and results.The summary reports should include the following enclosures:Enclosure 1: Annual Inventory ReportNumber and value of times scheduled for inventory;Number and value of equipment inventoried;Number and value of item added to the records as a result of the inventory;Number of adjustments to the records, including transfers, location and other datachanges;Number and value of missing items; Number and value of items previously surveyed and reinstated in the records;Number and value of items proposed for disposition as a result of the inventory; andNumber and value of items identified as requiring obvious repair.Enclosure 2: Results of Inventory  Numerical FindingsEnclosure 3: Inventory Analysis  Observations from conducting inventoryEnclosure 4: Inventory Shortages, by Equipment Control Number, Item Name, Value andAccountThe final report shall be sent to the COTR/HQ-LMD.In addition, during the initial year of the inventory the contractor shall:Perform and assist in the reconciliation of a 100%, wall to wall, floor to ceiling,physical inventory of each NASA Center.Confirm item serial numbers and descriptions with recorded property information.Provided below is a list of all of the NASA Facilities (Center Quantities) that would beincluded in this contract as well as the estimated total property at each facility.

<DESC>Introduction
THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.  SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS MUST HAVE THEIR SIZE STATUS CERTIFIED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.  ALL SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. THE NAICS CODE IS 541711 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500.
Description 
This initiative will provide for the continuation of the Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRCs) program, as well as the expansion, to include collaboration on experimental research projects and maintenance of a central BRC Portal. The BRCs will be established to provide the scientific community with databases that house not only genomics data, but also a variety of research data about infectious diseases caused by selected groups of human pathogens in the NIAID Category A-C Priority Pathogen lists for biodefense research, as well as pathogens causing emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/topics/emerging/list.htm), and to make available analytical resources and bioinformatics services. 

Specifically, the contractor shall be required to establish and maintain a Bioinformatics Resource Center that will provide scientific, web-based database resources to researchers who use in their investigations genomics and other basic research data of microbial organisms. To provide these resources, the Centers will: 1) collect and efficiently update research data for multiple pathogens; 2) establish databases that store, integrate, and annotate a large variety of experimental data types from different public and private data sources; 3) develop interfaces to the databases to allow external users to easily query, retrieve, analyze, upload, and download data; 4) develop software tools and algorithms to analyze and curate pathogen research data. Software developed by the Centers shall be made available to the scientific community with an open source license, with the appropriate tutorials and help documentation. Data generated by the Centers will also be publicly disseminated to the scientific community. Outreach activities to the scientific community, hands-on training and workshops shall be provided by the BRC.

The expansion of the BRCs program will provide the opportunity for the BRCs to collaborate with experimental research laboratories through “Driving Biological Projects” (DBPs) to apply bioinformatics techniques to investigate and support experimental biology research in infectious diseases.  One of the BRCs shall support and maintain the BRCs Portal of information for the BRCs program (currently named BRC-Central http://www.brc-central.org/). The BRCs Portal will serve as the central data repository and analysis resource for all targeted pathogens for selected data types, and will facilitate interoperability projects among the BRCs and with other bioinformatics resources.

Upon award, the new contractors will have to ensure an effective transition of the data and software hosted by the incumbent BRCs contractors (see http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/brc/awards.htm for the current BRC web sites) into the new BRC and BRCs Portal.

Capability statements submitted as a result of this announcement should demonstrate the offerors’ qualifications and experience, specifically providing evidence as to their capability to perform this requirement, with particular attention to the following:

Technical Capability:  Adequacy, appropriateness, and feasibility of the scientific and technical approaches to providing the proposed Bioinformatics Resource Center, with the following considerations:  1) adequacy and appropriateness of the documented experience in establishing and maintaining bioinformatics resources; adequacy, appropriateness and feasibility of the proposed plan to establish and maintain a database that supports a variety of research data types and datasets associated to the selected group of pathogens; adequacy and appropriateness of the proposed analysis resources, including the microbial genome annotation resource and the provision of existing or new analysis tools; adequacy and feasibility of the plan to solicit and establish DBPs; and adequacy and feasibility of the plan to establish strong collaborations with the scientific community, including the outreach and training activities; 2) availability and adequacy of facilities, computational and other resources dedicated to carry out all phases of the proposed project for the duration of the contract period, including those of subcontractors and consultants; 3) adequacy of the computer equipment, network infrastructure, database management systems and overall information technology systems administration.  Personnel/Management: adequacy, appropriateness and relevance of expertise, experience, qualifications, and availability of the key professional and technical staff with a project of similar size, scope, and complexity.  Expertise in infectious diseases or microbiology is required.  Past performance is considered essential. In addition to demonstrating that they have met the above qualifications, interested parties must identify at least one other project of similar size and complexity.  

The Government anticipates multiple awards.  It is anticipated that the duration of the contracts will be a maximum of five (5) years; however, the length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research.  

Small business and 8(a) contractors are reminded that in order to qualify as a set-aside, 51% of the direct labor must be performed by the prime contractor.  It is anticipated the total effort of approximately 12.4 FTEs for the BRC and 16.4 FTEs for the BRC and the BRC Portal combined will be needed to accomplish this project. Interested organizations should submit three (3) copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above.  Interested organizations presenting a capability statement in response to this sources sought announcement must identify their size status.  Written capability statements should be received by the NIAID Contracting Officer by July 23, 2008.  Please reference the solicitation number on all related correspondence.  No collect calls or facsimiles will be accepted. E-mail transmissions will be accepted.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  See Government-wide numbered note 25.

<DESC>2008 HIV/AIDS Prevention and Intervention Services for Female Youth at Greater Risk for Juvenile Delinquency

INTRODUCTION

The following requirement shall be solicited utilizing FAR Subpart 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures and is therefore mandated by law to be set aside for small business concerns.  The Simplified Acquisition award threshold shall not exceed $100,000.  This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE seeks to determine the availability of  small business concerns (e.g. 8(a) concerns, service-disabled, veteran-owned small business concerns, HubZone small business concerns, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses and veteran-owned small businesses) that have the capability to:

Implement a program that provides prevention/intervention education, on a community level, to female youth that are putting themselves at greater risk for gang involvement and STD/HIV infection. 

This information is sought for market research purposes and will assist the Government plan its acquisition strategy.  

THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH.  THE OFFICE ON WOMEN’S HEALTH WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.
		
BACKGROUND

A number of researchers have suggested that, “the gang can serve as a surrogate extended family for adolescents who do not see their own families as meeting their needs for belonging, nurturance, and acceptance” (Huff, 1993: 6; see also Campbell, 1990; Joe and Chesney-Lind, 1995; also see Decker and Van Winkle, 1996; Hunt, Mackenzie and Joe-Laidler, 2000). The gang can offer a network of friends for girls whose parents are unable to provide stable family relations; moreover, girls’ friendships with other gang members may provide a support system for coping with family problems, abuse and other life problems (Fleisher and Krienert, 2004; Joe and Chesney-Lind, 1995).  

According to respondents to the 2005 National Gang Threat Assessment Survey, at risk female youth appear to be moving from minor delinquent behaviors to more violent gang related crimes. Some female gang members have graduated from affiliate’s status to membership. Many girl gangs are splinter organizations of male gangs and appear to be influenced by their male counterparts. For example, females now assist in the movement of drugs and weapons for male gang members, while others are committing drug sales, robberies, assaults, and drive-by shootings on behalf of male gang members.

Although, females are taking more active roles in gangs they also continue to assume traditionally subordinate functions such as providing sexual support to male gang members.  Respondents to the 2005 National Gang Threat Assessment Survey reported that female gang members in their jurisdiction often engage in prostitution.  This type of risky sexual behavior puts girls at risk for contracting STD/HIV.

RESPONSE INFORMATION

Responses must clearly convey a contactors experience and/or capability to perform the following identified tasks: 
1. Recruit and retain at least 50 at-risk girls in a 9 month model program that addresses the intersection between STDs/HIV/AIDS, violence and juvenile deliquency as well as the concurrent risks that are inherent to the at-risk population (i.e. anger, self-esteem, depression, and other social threats, etc...)
2. Develop and implement a gender-specific, age-appropriate, culturally sensitive curriculum which addresses the link between sexually transmitted diseases, violence and juvenile deliquency.
3. Build (form, lead and develop) partnerships/coalitions within the targeted community to develop capacity among community organizations that target and service youth.
4. Develop and implement an assessment tool that will measure the effectiveness of the model program based upon evidenced-based methods of evaluation.
5. Be able to define "at-risk" within a targeted community and identify girls that meet the targeted parameters.
6. Have a diversified staff that is capable of addressing the multiple concurrent issues of female youth targeted for this model program.
7. Work in collaboration with other contractors and federal staff members.
8. Write, publish and present information obtained from research and from implementing this model program.

Each response should include the following Business Information:

a.  DUNS.
b.  Company Name.
c.  Company Address.
d. Type of Company (i.e., small business, 8(a), woman owned, veteran owned, etc.) as validated via the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). All companies or individual seeking to contract with the Government must register on the CCR located at http://www.ccr.gov/index.asp 
e.  Company Point of Contact, Phone and Email address

The Simplified Acquisition award threshold shall not exceed $100,000.  This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE seeks to determine the availability of  small business concerns (e.g. 8(a) concerns, service-disabled, veteran-owned small business concerns, HubZone small business concerns, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses and veteran-owned small businesses) that have the capability to:

Develop and implement a model training program, specifically designed to train domestic violence service providers that counsel female survivors of domestic violence, to address the risks of contracting HIV/AIDS and HIV/AIDS prevention intervention strategies with their clients.  Also provide training to HIV/AIDS service providers on the intersection between domestic violence and HIV/AIDS.

This information is sought for market research purposes and will assist the Government plan its acquisition strategy.  

THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH.  THE OFFICE ON WOMEN’S HEALTH WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.
		
BACKGROUND

Female victims of domestic violence are particularly vulnerable to contracting HIV/AIDS because many are unable to protect themselves from infected partners.  Unlike individuals in non-abusive partnerships, individuals in abusive partnerships do not have the liberty to negotiate safe-sex practices such as using condoms or practicing abstinence.  There is a severe imbalance of power in abusive relationships, moreover, many individuals are unable to promptly leave their partners—should they suspect that their partner is having unprotected sex with others, using illegal substances, or engaging in other HIV related risky behaviors.   

Through this program, counselors and shelter workers are trained to integrate the messages about the risks of contracting HIV/AIDS in the services they provide to survivors of domestic violence. The major aim of this program is to educate counselors about how they can incorporate HIV/AIDS prevention strategies, and provide HIV/AIDS-related services, in a manner that is sensitive to the unique social and emotional challenges of the survivors.  This program should include teaching materials for both group and one-on-one settings.  

RESPONSE INFORMATION

1. Develop and implement a model training program for domestic violence service providers and HIV/AIDS service providers on the intersection between domestic violence and HIV/AIDS.
2. Build (lead and develop) partnerships/coalitions between the domestic violence service community and the HIV/AIDS services community.
3. Develop capacity within a community among community organizations to service the needs of survivors of domestic violence who may be at risk for HIV/AIDS.
4. Develop an effective, evidenced-based method for assessment of the model program.
5. Plan a regional and national level meeting focusing on the intersection between domestic violence and HIV/AIDS.
6. Work in collaboration with other contractors and Federal staff members.
7. Write, publish and present information obtained from research and from implementing this model training program.

<DESC>The government has concluded its market research for the FADS as set forth in the RFI for Solicitation Number W15PT07RS216, posted Aug 24, 2007. The resulting FADS performance specification has been posted to the IBOP which may be accessed by https:/ /abop. No additional information is available with regard to the FADS initiative. SCOPE: FADS will be an improved follow on to the current DVE + system. The system must be a two sensor system.  The observers sensor will be a 640 x 480 uncooled microbolometer with an 18-20 degree field of view.  The drivers sensor will be a 640 x 480 uncooled microbolometer with 40 x 30 degree field of view. The observers sensor must be mounted with a variable speed electronic pan and tilt system with a minimum slew rate of 35 degrees per second and a centering capability of at lease 45 degrees per second with a stand alone controller.  Faster panning speeds without image blur are desirable. The system must provide an interface for an image data recorder. The required local area processing must be able to be turned on and off by the user. Both the driver and the observer must have the ability to view the inputs from either of the two sensors using controls inside the vehicle. The system must have a sensor positioning icon on the observers display and also on the drivers display when the driver switches to the observers sensor. The icon will indicate the relative position of the sensor to the vehicle. The drivers and observers DCM must be compatible with the DVE ICD. The system must remain within the DVE + space claim. The power draw for the system must not exceed 96 Watts at max load. The system design must mitigate image jitter. Each system must be able to be completely installed and operationally ready using 4 man hours or less. The system must enable opening the hood of a vehicle equipped with FADS within one minute and the ability to close the hood and resume FADS operation also within one minute. In addition, desirable system capabilities are electronic zoom and an image data recording capability. The intended vehicle platform is the M1114 or M1151.  The proposal must be a mature system concept that must reach full-rate production within three months of contract award. It is desirable for first article delivery within six weeks of contract award.  A t least 5034 systems must be delivered to the government and installed by December 31, 2008. Other parameters include:  Must be operable by a skill level 1 military member. NO RESPONSE IS NECESSARY!

<a href="mailto:kevin.w.hill1@us.army.mil">Great Plains Regional Contracting Ofc</a>
<DESC>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Patient Warming (Air Convection).<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  <BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods.  Anticipated selection date is October 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Patient Warming (Air Convection), which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $46,022.71.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  This is included as a reporting metric.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include: 1. WARMING BLANKET (OR), DUAL POR - $12,469.19; 2. BLANKET WARMING UPPER BODY - $12,388.67; 3. THERMACARE QUILT, LOWER OR - $4,151.96; 4. BLANKET WARMING LOWER BODY - $3,892.27; 5. THERMACARE QUILT, UPPER OR - $3,470.01; 6. WARMING BLANKET (OR), LOWER BODY - $3,270.62; 7. HYPER/HYPOTHERMIA BLANKET, ADULT - $1,980.60; 8. WARMING BLANKET (PACU), FULL BODY - $1,210.60; 9. ADULT FULL BODY BLANKET - $1,115.55; 10. BLANKET, DUO-THERM 24 X 30 IN - $711.40<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>INTERESTED RESPONDENTS MUST PROVIDE DETAILED HARD COPY RESPONSES TO THE TECHNICAL CRITERIA REQUIREMENTS STATED WITHIN THIS NOTICE BY 3PM CST ON 30 July 2008.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide hard copy responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for mail to be lost, vendors must confirm with the Regional POC stated below that their submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  Each submitting vendor will confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>Responses should be sent via your preferred delivery carrier with a requested return receipt and/or tracking number to Mr. Jim Quinn, Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  (ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS TO INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT ARE NO LONGER ACCEPTED)  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Mr. Jim Quinn at (210) 292-3295 or email (Jim.Quinn.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil) prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested respondents are to respond to this FBO announcement by mailing their intent to participate with hard copies of the following information: company name, point of contact, address, phone number, fax, email address, announcement number, DAPA number and complete answers to the technical criteria to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); 5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); 6) Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price.  Therefore, National FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA.  and 7) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>If industry participation is unsatisfactory, the TPRB will decide whether to proceed with or delay the project.<BR><BR>All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Also, all communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.<BR><BR>The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Patient Warming (Air Convection) products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  At a minimum, a complete product line includes:  Upper Body Warming Blanket (Single Port & Dual Port); Lower Body Warming Blanket (Single Port & Dual Port); Adult Warming Blanket (Single Port); Full Body Warming Blanket (Single Port); Pediatric Warming Blanket, Underbody (Single Port & Dual Port); Pediatric Full Body (Single Port).<BR>2.	Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.<BR>3.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Patient Warming (Air Convection) product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>4.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.<BR>5.	Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. <BR>6.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.  <BR>7.	Vendors must supply instructions/directions for use for all products to be supplied.  Provide this information with the product literature submitted in response to this RFQ.<BR>8.	Vendors must provide in-service staff training and identify company resources for such requirements with the initial submittals.  Provide literature on the training.<BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary Clinical Product Team facilitated by the TRBO will request samples (at no charge to the government) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities.  Due to the length of the standardization process CPT members and facilities may be adjusted/changed due to military mission requirements (TDYs Deployments, PCS, etc.) when necessary.  Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 21 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples must be delivered to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM CST, on the twenty-first calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.<BR>  <BR>CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical evaluation period is estimated to last approximately 15 calendar days.  The CPT will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert-like scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to more acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>In the pre-source selection procedures above, the CPT will determine/approve that both product literature and sample sets are required for the evaluation.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical setting; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.  Clinical evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO and results will be forwarded to the CPT for review.  Clinical/Performance evaluation is more important than the price.  Based on the clinical evaluation results, the CPT will provide a vendor selection recommendation to the TPRB. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT will evaluate products based on the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below: <BR><BR>Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 <BR><BR>1.	Blanket is flexible, conforming and does not have memory.<BR>a.	Clinicians require this feature to maintained placement on patient. <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting by use of the warming blanket and warming unit by the clinicians at each evaluation facility.<BR>c.	Products will be applied and observed for ease of application and placement during evaluation.<BR><BR>2.	Product safety features audible or visual function correctly and consistently throughout use <BR>a.	Clinicians require this to know safety features have been deployed. <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting by use of the warming blanket and warming unit by the clinicians at each evaluation facility.<BR>c.	Clinicians will note the activation during the evaluation process.<BR><BR>3.	Warms to appropriate set temperature as indicated on unit<BR>a.	Clinicians require this feature to maintain a consistent temperature throughout use. <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting by use of the warming blanket and warming unit by the clinicians at each evaluation facility.<BR>c.	Products will be applied and observed for achieving set temperature during evaluation.<BR><BR>4.	Durability<BR>a.	Durability and material composition are important aspects due to the extended use of the blanket.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting by use of the warming blanket and warming unit by the clinicians at each evaluation facility.<BR>c.	Products will be applied and observed for durability and material composition during evaluation.<BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process. <BR>1.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Operational Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Impact on SKUs by each vendor.  5) The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.    <BR>2.	Vendors that meet the 3.0 clinical acceptability target threshold will be qualified to submit best value pricing for analysis to the TRBO.  Those vendors with results less than 3.0 will be disqualified from further consideration depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.  <BR>3.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing quotes, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Central Region.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>4.	Those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from further consideration.<BR>5.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis.  Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.<BR>6.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.<BR>7.	The Central Region (6, 7 & 8) TPRB reviews the data to support a selection of the best-value, lowest quote of the clinically preferred products.<BR>8.	The DSL will ensure that the prices, with discounts off the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) will be a good value, in conjunction with the volume purchasing commitment, and the technical merit of the submittal.<BR>9.	The Central Region TPRB votes for the best value for a single or multiple vendor selection(s).  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR>

It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  <BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three12-month option periods.  Anticipated selection date is October 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Patient Warming (Fluid), which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual demand of $51,408.22.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  This is included as a reporting metric.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include:  1. D-100 BLOOD/FLUID ADMINISTRATION SET - $3,870.30; 2. D-300 BLOOD/FLUID ADMINISTRATION SET - $7,372.22; 3. HOTLINE ADMINSTRATION SET DISPOSABLE - $7,702.58; 4. BLOOD AND FLUID ADMINISTRATION - $16,231.18; 5. D-300 BLOOD/FLUID ADMINISTRATION SET - $3,379.95; 6. HOTLINE ADMINSTRATION SET DISPOSABLE - $12,851.67<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>INTERESTED RESPONDENTS MUST PROVIDE DETAILED HARD COPY RESPONSES TO THE TECHNICAL CRITERIA REQUIREMENTS STATED WITHIN THIS NOTICE BY 3PM CST ON 30 July 2008.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide hard copy responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for mail to be lost, vendors must confirm with the Regional POC stated below that their submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  Each submitting vendor will confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>Responses should be sent via your preferred delivery carrier with a requested return receipt and/or tracking number to Mr. Jim Quinn, Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  (ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS TO INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT ARE NO LONGER ACCEPTED)  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Mr. Jim Quinn at (210) 292-3295 or Jim.Quinn.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested respondents are to respond to this FBO announcement by mailing their intent to participate with hard copies of the following information: company name, point of contact, address, phone number, fax, email address, announcement number, DAPA number and complete answers to the technical criteria to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); 5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); 6) Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price.  Therefore, National FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA.  and 7) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>If industry participation is unsatisfactory, the TPRB will decide whether to proceed with or delay the project.<BR><BR>All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Also, all communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.<BR><BR>The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process.<BR><BR> The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Patient Warming (Fluid) products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  At a minimum, a complete product line includes:  Blood and Fluid Administration Sets - Routine (KVO to 200ml/hr); Blood and Fluid Administration Sets - Trauma/Rapid (2000[+ +]) ml/hr); Blood and Fluid Warmers Administration Sets (Routine).  Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.<BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Patient Warming (Fluid) product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.<BR>4.	Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. <BR>5.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.  <BR>6.	Vendors must supply instructions/directions for use for all products to be supplied.  Provide this information with the product literature submitted in response to this RFQ.<BR>7.	Vendors must provide in-service staff training and identify company resources for such requirements with the initial submittals.  Provide literature on the training.<BR>8.	Vendors must provide products with visible expiration dating on the labeling.<BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary Clinical Product Team facilitated by the TRBO will request samples (at no charge to the government) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities.  Due to the length of the standardization process CPT members and facilities may be adjusted/changed due to military mission requirements (TDYs, Deployments, PCS, etc...) when necessary.  Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 21 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples must be delivered to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM CST, on the twenty-first calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.<BR>  <BR>CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical evaluation period is estimated to last approximately 15 calendar days.  The CPT will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert-like scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to more acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>In the pre-source selection procedures above, the CPT will determine/approve that both product literature and sample sets are required for the evaluation.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical setting; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.  Clinical evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO and results will be forwarded to the CPT for review.  Clinical/Performance evaluation is more important than the price.  Based on the clinical evaluation results, the CPT will provide a vendor selection recommendation to the TPRB. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT will evaluate products based on the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below: <BR><BR>Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 <BR><BR>1.	Tubing is flexible and does not have memory.<BR>a.	Clinicians require this feature to prevent coiling, kinking and tangling of tubing when removed from packaging. <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting by use of the warming blanket and warming unit by the clinicians at each evaluation facility.<BR>c.	Products will be applied and observed for ease of use and non-kinking during use and evaluation.<BR><BR>2.	Product safety features audible or visual function correctly and consistently throughout use <BR>a.	Clinicians require this to know safety features have been deployed <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting by use of the warming blanket and warming unit by the clinicians at each evaluation facility.<BR>c.	Clinicians will note the activation during the evaluation process.<BR><BR>3.	Warms to appropriate set temperature at set flow rate as indicated on unit<BR>a.	Clinicians require this feature to maintained a consistent temperature throughout use <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting by use of the warming blanket and warming unit by the clinicians at each evaluation facility.<BR>c.	Products will be applied and observed for achieving set temperature during evaluation.<BR><BR>4.	Compatibility with blood product Warming<BR>a.	Compatibility of supplies are important aspects of blood product administration<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting by use of the warming blanket and warming unit by the clinicians at each evaluation facility.<BR>c.	Products will be applied and observed for compatibility and versatility during evaluation.<BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process. <BR>1.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Operational Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Impact on SKUs by each vendor.  (5) The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.    <BR>2.	Vendors that meet the 3.0 clinical acceptability target threshold will be qualified to submit best value pricing for analysis to the TRBO.  Those vendors with results less than 3.0 will be disqualified from further consideration depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.  <BR>3.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing quotes, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Central Region.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>4.	Those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from further consideration.<BR>5.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis.  Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.<BR>6.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.<BR>7.	The Central Region (6, 7 & 8) TPRB reviews the data to support a selection of the best-value, lowest quote of the clinically preferred products.<BR>8.	The DSL will ensure that the prices, with discounts off the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) will be a good value, in conjunction with the volume purchasing commitment, and the technical merit of the submittal.<BR>9.	The Central Region TPRB votes for the best value for a single or multiple vendor selection(s).  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.<BR>

<DESC>Installation Contracting Command, Regional Contracting Center-Fort Bragg, North Carolina intends to award, on a sole source basis in accordance with 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, a contract to Spectrum Mobile, Inc., 2474 Walnut Street Ste 216, Cary, NC 27513 for a custom software application with annual renewable maintenance in support of the Directorate of Information Management, Fort Bragg. It is imperative that the mobile solution selected to fulfill this requirement be able to seamlessly interface with the existing Remedy system being used. The system will be used on mobile handheld bar-coding devices in conjunction with the current utilized Remedy warehouse inventory system.  The application must operate in an OFFLINE or BATCH mode with Remedy in addition to the instances where online connectivity is desired.  The requested software provides this capability and does not need to rely on network connectivity. Also, part of the requirement is that the data must be down-loaded to the hand held device and all the work that is performed throughout the day be uploaded back to the server when it is cradled back on the network. The software identified as being capable of satisfying these requirements is the Mobile Reach solution which is a customized version of Mobile Reach Splitware Suite for BMC Remedy version 3.9. The Mobile Reach solution is completely integrated with Remedy and has been crafted to take advantage of the workflows of the mobile employee in a Non wireless environment as well as any connected scenarios. Mobile Reach is the only mobile vendor within the BMC Technology Alliance Program that has had a mobile solution for the ITSM 7.X environment for the past 17 months. Because the application will be loaded onto equipment attached to the Fort Bragg network, the application must have a CoN from NETCOM, which this application has.  Additionally, because this is a customized application made specifically for use with DOIMs Remedy inventory management application, the software maintenance can only be acquired thru Spectrum Mobile, Inc. This is not a request for Competitive Proposals.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If you feel your firm possesses the ability to provide these supplies, you must respond by demonstrating your firms technical capability to meet the requirement.  If no affirmative written response is received, the supplies will be awarded without further notice.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the email address provided below no later than 14 July 2008, 2:00pm Eastern Time.  POC for this notice is Brandon Hawkins, Email: brandon.a.hawkins@us.army.mil

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) at the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 using Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) to acquire 20 each DC-7 parachutes with risers, installation, and MT1S reserve parachute system.  The Government believes that the only responsible source capable of satisfying the agency requirement is Airborne Systems North America, (formerly Para-Flite Inc), 5800 Magnolia Avenue, Pennsauken, NJ 08109 who owns the patent rights to these items.  A justification for other than full and open competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition. The following specification applies to the DC-7 parachute requirement: The parachute canopy shall be 375 square feet to accommodate a payload ranging from 220-300 pounds and be capable of reaching at least 20 miles per hour forward speed.  The parachute shall be capable of achieving descent rates of 0-10 feet per second in no wind conditions using a static deep brake setting. Slotted stabilizer bars are required for good slow speed performance and stability.  A span wise constructed seam is required in order to fit a canopy of this size into the required development bags and containers. The color scheme shall be as follows: (a) Top Skin: 1st span of fabric shall be fire red, the second span of fabric shall be white, the third span of fabric shall be royal blue, the 4th span of fabric shall be royal blue; (b) Bottom Skin: 1st span of fabric shall be fire red, the 2nd span of fabric shall be fire red, the 3rd span of fabric shall be white, the 4th span of fabric shall be royal blue, the 5th span of fabric shall be royal blue; (c) End cells shall be fire red; (d) Ribs shall be fire red; (e) Stabilizers shall be fire red; (f) Slider shall be fire red. The estimated value of this simplified acquisition is less than $80,000.00.  No Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued and no response will be made to letters or telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation. This is not a request for competitive quotes, but serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education intends to issue a six-month, no-cost extension to existing contract #  ED-01-CO-0039, Task Order # 0006.  The current period of performance ends on August 28, 2008.  The purpose of the extension is to enable members of the Mathematica Policy Research team  to assist the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) with completing the National Evaluation Report (NER).

On September 15, 2003 the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) of the U.S. Department of Education (ED) awarded contract ED-01-CO- 0039/0006 to Mathematica Policy Research (MPR) of Princeton, New Jersey, to be the national evaluation contractor for the SACD research program. The purpose of SACD is to determine the impact of seven social and character development-oriented programs on grade school students’ socio-emotional and educational development. The primary charge for MPR is to collect data at 84 schools over a three-year period (and 12 additional schools over a 2-year period), and to analyze the data to determine the impact of the programs. Utilizing MPR's technical reports, IES is presently authoring the National Evaluation Report (NER), which will present the study findings. The NER will be released to the public after peer review and final approval by the Standards and Review office within IES.

During the six-month period (August 28, 2008 – February 28, 2009), the 10-member MPR research team will support IES (at no additional cost beyond the amount in the current contract budget) with writing and finalizing the NER. 

The successful completion of the NER will depend heavily on the experiences of the MPR team, which has performed work on the SACD project for the nearly the past 5 years.  MPR is uniquely qualified to perform this work because of the following competencies, experiences, and skills: Access to SACD data that was collected; Familiarity and extensive experience conducting analyses using the SACD data; Proven record of providing technical reports detailing the methods used and the findings from this research; Proven record of answering technical questions; Demonstrated ability to assist in addressing questions about the methods and findings from this research.  This notice is for informational purposes only.  A request for proposal is not available.  Interested parties may, however,  request further information no later than July 22, 2008, by email to Contract Specialist John Machen at john.machen@ed.gov.

Isotopes may be analyzed using other methods as well. The sensitivity of AMS allows administration of low concentration of drugs so that the effect is nontoxic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in">The action or effect of a drug is dependent upon the specific interaction of the drug with a molecular target in the body. It is believed that the intensity of the action relies on the amount of drug reaching the target molecule. The amount of drug that reaches the target molecule is related to dosage, absorption, distribution, biotransformation and excretion. This method will take into account the time versus drug concentration response to ensure the correct amount of active drug is present to do the work.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in">It is envisioned that the methodology be coupled to pharmacokinetic modeling so that a test dose may be applied to an individual and used to establish the optimal dose and dosing interval to attain the required drug concentration at the target site and to assess when drug resistance has developed based on changes in the kinetics of drug metabolism.</p>

The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Proposed vendor will conduct life history and fisheries research in support of North Pacific billfish stock assessments. The research is organized into two collaborative research projects that initially target blue marlin, striped marlin, sailfish and wahoo. Project 1 will focus on the estimation of life history parameters. Project 2 will be a comparative study between fleets harvesting blue marlin in the Pacific Ocean. Proposed contractor SHALL perform the following tasks:  1. Collaborative Life History Parameter Estimation- The contractor will analyze biological samples and estimate life history parameters, including age and growth and age-at-maturity. Data will include striped marlin, sailfish and wahoo samples from Taiwan's port sampling and at-sea observer programs. To the extent possible, data will also include samples from the Hawaii longline observer program and Japanese research and training vessels. 2.

This research will be presented at the 9th meeting of the Interim Scientific Committee (ISC) tentatively scheduled for July 2009. The assessment will be completed in 2010. The contractor will assist with the compilation of all available catch, effort and size-at-catch data. Datasets will include (1) Japanese longline data from logbooks, (2) length frequency data from Japanese research and training vessels, (3) Hawaii longline data from logbooks and associated length frequency data, (4) Taiwan longline data from logbooks and associated length frequency data, and (5) other longline fleets as necessary. The contractor will conduct comparative analyses to determine fleet specific differences and assess the feasibility of substitution of data between fleets.  The government intends to negotiate a firm- fixed price contract with a period of performance that will start from date of award and ends May 31, 2009 plus two option years. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed attention to Maria Mendoza at (206)527-7513 or email at maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov This is a small purchase action estimated value not to exceed $100,000.00. ****The Western Regional Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) as of October 1, 2003.

<DESC><p>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service Fish Biology &amp; Stock Assessment Division located in Honolulu, Hi on a sole source basis with National Sun Yat-Sen University. The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Proposed vendor will conduct size-at-catch research in support of North Pacific Ocean mahi mahi (Coryphaena hippurus) and opah (Lampris regius) stock assessments. Specific tasks include the collection of size data on mahi mahi and opah caught by Taiwan fishing fleets that land their catch at the fishing port of Tungkang. Size structure comparisons between different international fisheries will also be conducted to assess the geographic distributions of mahi mahi and opah in the North Pacific Ocean, and the feasibility of data substitution between fleets. Proposed contractor SHALL perform the following tasks: 1. Collaborative Size-at-Catch and Spatial Structure Analyses<br />This is a collaborative project between scientists from NOAA Fisheries, Pacific Island Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC), National Research Institute for Far Seas Fisheries (NRIFSF), and National Sun Yat-Sen University (NSYSU). The goal of this project is to collect size-at-catch data to support North Pacific Ocean mahi mahi and opah stock assessments. In the U.S., the Magnuson-Stevens Act calls for the establishment of annual catch limits for all species listed as Management Unit Species in existing Fishery Management Plans by 2010. This research will facilitate that goal. The contractor will conduct size-at-catch sampling of mahi mahi and opah landed at Tungkang, a major fishing port for these species in Taiwan. To the extent possible, historical size-at-catch data sets from other Taiwanese fishing ports will be collected, and, along with contemporary port sampling data, assembled into a user-friendly accessible database. Mahi mahi and opah size-at-catch data from the Taiwanese, Japanese, and Hawaiian fishing fleets will be combined to assess the geographic distributions of the species, and the feasibility of  data substitution between fleets (when data from one fleet is missing, can data from another fleet be substituted for it). To the extent possible, gear- and fisheries-specific estimates of relative abundance will be computed for both species and comparative analyses conducted.  The government intends to negotiate a firm- fixed price contract with a period of performance that will start from date of award and ends May 31, 2009 plus two option years. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.

<DESC>The Regional Contracting Office, Northeast, Marine Corps Base, Quantico, Virginia intends to award a sole source contract to Christopher Chadbourne and Associates (CCA), 129 Portland Street FL 2, Boston, Massachusetts 02114-2014 for the services to create, produce, and finalize graphic mechanical files within complex exhibits within the National Museum of the Marine Corps (NMMC).
 
  This contract is a continuation of an eight month study conducted by CCA.  The efficiencies gained by using CCAs in depth familiarity of the project, their warehoused fonts and output specifications, including digital color standards, will save several months in color corrections and fine-tuning output.  Mission failure is highly likely if the Government were to contract with another firm.  The delays would jeopardize the overall project, would be a duplication of effort and expenditure of funds causing substantial duplication of cost to the Government.
 
The period of performance will be for the base CLIN and three (3) option CLINS from the date of award.  This notice is not a request for proposals.  No solicitation document is available for competitive bidding, however, interested parties may submit a written statement of capability for satisfying this requirement to the email address identified below no later than 12:00 PM 22 July 2008.

<CONTACT>Michael G. Fredericks, Email michael.fredericks@usafa.af.mil
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ), solicitation number F4BWN08120A002, in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13. 
STATEMENT OF WORK TO DESIGN A REPLACEMENT CONTROL SYSTEM FOR THE USAFA TRISONIC WIND TUNNEL
1.0  PURPOSE. The purpose of this effort is to propose a design to upgrade/replace the obsolete system for controlling the Trisonic Wind Tunnel located in Building 2410, Aeronautics Laboratory, United States Air Force Academy. 
2.0  BACKGROUND. The subject control system is part of the permanently installed support equipment for the Aeronautics Laboratory's Trisonic Wind Tunnel (TWT). The Facility is used for cadet instruction and aeronautics research. The TWT is powered by air stored in large tanks pressurized to 600 psig.  The primary parameters that must be controlled are 1) the pressure in the stilling chamber at the upstream end of the wind tunnel and 2) the position of the model support system in the wind tunnel test section.  The present control system was installed in 1988, and consists of a Moog chassis containing a series of signal conditioners, controllers and amplifiers, and an Allen-Bradley programmable logic controller (PLC).  These devices control hydraulic valves that open or close the pressure control valves and move the model support mechanism. The PLC also serves as an interlock to prevent operation of the wind tunnel unless required conditions are satisfied. The control system is still functional, although at least one amplifier has failed affecting a pressure display. The existing system is based on obsolete analog technology and requires extensive manual tuning via multiple potentiometers for the system to function as desired.
3.0  SCOPE. The contractor shall perform a thorough review of the existing control system and produce a document illustrating the required function of a control and interlock system for the wind tunnel.  This must include: 1) control of the stilling chamber pressure, 2) position of the model in the test section, 3) manual control of all operator-controllable features, 4) an interlock to prevent operation of the wind tunnel unless all systems are operable and in the proper state, 5) systems to ensure shutdown of the wind tunnel in the event of power failure, loss of hydraulic pressure, emergency stop or excessive stilling chamber pressure, and 6) an interlock system to include physical barriers or warning systems to prevent operation of the tunnel if personnel are in potentially hazardous locations.  The contractor shall then recommend hardware and software as appropriate to fully build and install a control system capable of performing these functions and facilitating future control features. It is desirable to have some level of communication between the data acquisition systems and the wind tunnel control systems. For example, if the aerodynamic loads on a force balance measured by the data acquisition system exceed the recommended maxima, the model positioning system should reduce the angle of attack to prevent damage to the equipment. These potential interfaces will be coordinated with Aeronautics Laboratory personnel.
4.0  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS 
4.1  Conditions of Work: 
4.1.1  The contractor shall perform this work in a manner which will minimize the disruption of normal Air Force Academy operations. 
4.1.2  The area of work shall be restricted to Rooms 113, A-10, and A-11 of Building 2410, Aeronautics Laboratory.  
4.1.3  Parking of the contractor's vehicles shall be restricted to the parking lot south of Building 2410, and specifically to the spaces designated by the Contracting Officer's representative at the site. The company’s name shall be prominently displayed on all contractor's vehicles parked in the designated spaces. 
4.1.4  The contractor may use reasonable required amounts of electricity and water from existing outlets and lines without charge. 
4.1.5  The contractor shall comply with all applicable Air Force and USAF Academy regulations pertaining to safety, traffic control, and fire prevention. 
4.1.6  The contractor's working hours shall be between 7:30 AM and 4:30 PM, with no work on weekends or federal holidays. Permission to work at times other than those specified shall be obtained from the Contracting Officer at least 5 working days in advance. 
4.2  Transportation: The contractor shall provide all transportation necessary for travel of personnel and shipment of parts to and from the Air Force Academy. 
5.0  TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS 
5.1  The contractor shall thoroughly examine the existing control system and associated documentation. A reasonable number of test runs may be conducted to demonstrate the control system function and allow collection of data as necessary.
5.2  The contractor shall thoroughly document the logic necessary to require all systems to be functional and in proper states before the valves in the high pressure system can be opened.
5.3  The contractor shall thoroughly describe and document the feedback control loop required to maintain the pressure in the stilling chamber within operator-specified limits and control the rise time of the pressure. This must include control signals sent to the existing hydraulic valves that control the actuators opening the valves to the high pressure system.
5.4  The contractor shall thoroughly describe and document the feedback control loop required to maintain the operator-specified angle of attack of models attached to the model positioning system. This must include control signals sent to the existing hydraulic valves that control the position of the mechanism.
5.5  The contractor shall work with Aeronautics Laboratory personnel to consider all potential emergency scenarios (loss of power, loss of hydraulic pressure, etc) and build into the design of the control system features to immediately shut off the wind tunnel in an emergency.
5.6  The contractor shall design an interlock system to provide suitable warning to personnel that the tunnel is ready to run or that any systems are in a potentially hazardous state.
5.7  The contractor shall produce a proposal for a system to include hardware and software to accomplish the design characteristics of the control system and interlock.         
6.0  SCHEDULE. All work shall be coordinated through the Contracting Officer's representative at the site and completed no later than 180 days after contract award.  The total accumulated downtime of the Trisonic Wind Tunnel for this work shall not exceed 10 business days.
 7.0  Basis for Award.

<DESC>The Gifford Pindchot National Forest, Washington, intends to acquire by contract roadside brushing.  The estimated annual quantity is 58.3 miles.

The government will proceed to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) Solicitation  restricted to small business concerns.  Offerors will be evaluated on: price; experience; past performance; key personnel and subcontractors; proposed equipment; price realism; and Level of Confidence Assessment Rating (LOCAR).  Contract award will be to the offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is the best value to the government.  This solicitation will result in a fixed-price contract for one year.  The estimated contract performance period is from August 1 2008, to Nov1, 2008.  

Service Contract Act wage rates will apply to any contract resulting from this solicitation.  This solicitation will be available on, or about, July 7, 2008.  Offers are due on July 28,  2008.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is  115310 and the annual size standard is $6.5 million.    All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the government.  In accordance with FAR 4.1102(a), prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract.  Lack of registration in the CCR on the part of the offeror will render an offeror ineligible for award.  Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov//.

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.  Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—  (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.

(2) DoD is unable to receive a payment request or provide acceptance in electronic form;

(e) Unless otherwise provided in the order, the Contractor (1) may deliver the approved first article as a part of the order quantity, provided it meets all order requirements for acceptance and was not consumed or destroyed in testing; and (2) shall remove and dispose of any first article from the Government test facility at the Contractor's expense. (f) If the Government does not act within the time specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this clause, the Contracting Officer shall, upon timely written request from the Contractor, equitably adjust under the Changes clause of this order the delivery or performance dates and/or the order price, and any other contractual term affected by the delay.

Before first article approval, the costs thereof shall not be allocable to the order for (1) progress payments, or (2) termination settlements if the order is terminated for the convenience of the Government. (h) The Government may waive the requirement for first article approval test where supplies identical or similar to those called for in the schedule have been previously furnished by the Contractor and have been accepted by the Government. The Contractor may request a waiver. (i) The contractor shall produce both the first article and the production quantity at the same facility. Testing: The test rolls will be held in SSA's printer area for three days to allow for proper acclimatizing. The rolls will then be used on the appropriate machinery to ensure that the paper meets all requirements for surface stability, vapor emissions, print quality maintenance and fusing quality. The paper must meet all specifications set forth in this synopsis. The core must function properly with shifting of the paper or jamming. More than one non-compliant roll in the test group constitutes failure.  Once SSA gives final approval of the test rolls, the Government will have an additional 30 calendar days to ensure that the paper has no detrimental effects on the printing equipment. Additional criteria that may be assessed during this period are: (1) the continued use of the paper must not result in the emission of odor-causing compounds such as sulfur compounds, chlorides, rein-based aerosols or organics; 2) any coatings on the paper must not cause fusing failures; 3) the paper must not cause fusing failures due to the inclusion of synthetic resins synthetic sizing agents or plastics; 4) the paper must not create excessive dust. The amount of paper dust and chads must not exceed 75-260 micrograms per cubic meter (SSA Health code standard) or cause printer malfunctions and operator interventions; and, 5) paper must not have additives or other conditions that reduce print quality. If the paper fails to meet these criteria during that period, SSA reserves the right to cancel the order. The contractor shall be responsible for any roll that cannot be used within 10 inches of the core, or for which the core does not function properly, at no additional charge to the Government.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>VA National Center for PTSDDate: 06/23/2008Project: Rewrite and Edit Fact SheetsDESCRIPTION OF WORK The NCPTSD Website (www.ncptsd.va.gov) contains 135 Fact Sheets (i.e., brief overviews of information) on a variety of topics related to PTSD and traumatic stress.  Specific audience groups were created as part of a major website re-design.  In addition the Center has begun the process of repackaging fact sheets originally written for professional audiences into material appropriate for the general public.  The expected cost of this acquisition's range is from $25,000 to $100,000Fact sheets need to be presented in a way that will capitalize on adult learning strategies in order to increase the impact of the material on the reader.  We believe several steps are necessary to insure that fact sheets are appropriate for the general public, including veterans, other trauma survivors, and family members.1.	Fifty two (52) existing fact sheets for the general public need to be reviewed.  Content should be revised so that it is easy to understand and is engaging to our general audience.  This means that it needs to be both written at a 7th grade reading level and presented in a manner which is accessible to this audience.2.	Thirty six (36) fact sheets that currently serve as both lay and professional audience fact sheets need to be revised so that there is a specific version written for each audience group.  Again, information needs to be written at both the correct grade level and in a way that is accessible to the targeted audience.3.	Forty seven (47) fact sheets for professional audiences need to be reviewed.  Content should be revised so that it is presented in an easy to understand format that is suitable for a professional audience.4.	Finally, redundant content within audience groups needs to be identified and eliminated.  In some cases the content can be eliminated while in other cases content might be revised and included in other existing fact sheets.Fact sheets content can be supplied to the vendor in html format, or text can be pulled directly from the Website by the vendor.  A VA Education Specialist will work with the vendor to provide guidance on necessary changes and to review overall strategy for edits.   The vendor will accept up to three rounds of edits from the NCPTSD Executive Division.  Final fact sheets will be supplied by the vendor in a web-ready format as specified below. DELIVERABLES:Contractor will provide final revised educational materials in web-ready format, including at least 52 fact sheets for the general public, 36 fact sheets (that serve two audiences), need to be divided and written for each specific audience, and 47 fact sheets need to be reviewed and edited as needed for the professional audience. SKILLS NEEDEDThe contractor needs to be proficient in creating educational materials on health (and preferably mental health) for both a lay and professional audience.  This requires understanding of: how to translate research into practice, curriculum development, adult learning strategies, scientific writing, and social marketing.  Contractor must be familiar with VA/Government 508 compliance regulations so that fact sheets can be delivered in a web-ready format.Specifically, the contractor must:1)	Demonstrate an understanding of all elements involved in this project including:a.	Ability to write effectively for a variety of audiences including the Centers audiences as specified in this work requestb.	Experience in creating effective educational materials for health promotionc.	Experience in taking research findings and translating to educational formats easily absorbed and retained by learners d.	Experience working with researchers and clinicianse.	Knowledge in making materials web-ready as per Center's website specificationsf.	Familiarity with trauma and PTSD preferred2)	Have at least two years experience in this type of work.3)	Fully describe past experience in conducting the type of work specified in this solicitation.4)	Have sufficient knowledge of the National Center's extensive website and familiarity of Center's portfolio of fact sheets and other materials such that new materials are produced that are compatible with the Center's current Website.EVALUATION CRITERIAThe government will award a contract based on technical experience, past performance and cost/price.  FACTOR 1: EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL APPROACHa)	Demonstrate your understanding of the solicitation requirements and submit a proposed approach to meeting and/or exceeding contract specification and deadlines.  b)	Demonstrate that you are currently and regularly engaged in writing and editing educational content focused on health/mental health for both a lay and professional audience.c)	Edit the sample fact sheet "Nightmares" located at http://ncptsd.va.gov/ncmain/ncdocs/fact_shts/fs_nightmares.html?opm=1&rr=rr28&srt=d&echorr=true so that it is appropriate for a general audience and submit with your proposal.d)	Describe the proposed Project Team for this effort and provide a brief resume of key personnele)	Describe how you plan to accomplish this work including completion dates.FACTOR 2: PAST PERFORMANCEa)	Describe your past experience with creating and revising educational content as specified in the scope of work. FACTOR 3: COST/PRICEa)	The pricing proposal should be specific and separate from the technical proposal.  It shall contain supporting cost information in sufficient detail to indicate how the offeror arrived at the proposed prices.  Factor 1: Experience and technical approach	Mandatory items satisfied	Total Maximum Points	Rating	CommentsSub factors:  a)  Ability to write effectively for a variety of audiences				b)  Knowledge in creating  web-ready materials as per Center's website specifications				c)  Experience creating effective educational materials				d)  Sample Fact Sheet written and evaluated by VA Education Specialist				e)  Plan to accomplish work including completion dates				Factor 2: Past Performance				Sub factors:  a)  Fully describe your past experience with creating and revising educational content as specified in the scope of work.				**Please contact Stacy Sullivan at stacy.sullivan@va.gov or call 802-296-6336 for full RFP document**

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Background:
It is increasingly difficult to create software to deal successfully with increased device and system complexity.  Moreover, networked distributed systems create vast increases in the scale and scope of information processing applications, exacerbating the challenges to the system engineers’ ability to specify, design, build, verify and test software. This situation is an emerging issue in information technology in general, but the requirement of military systems set them sharply apart from non-military applications in terms of reliability, robustness, security, interoperability and real time operation.

Business, government, and technical endeavors ranging from financial transactions to space missions increasingly require complex software systems to function correctly. The complexity of the software arises from stringent requirements (e.g., for reliability in performance and integrity of the data used), the need to support a range of interactions with the environment in real time, and/or certain structural features. These attributes make software difficult to produce.

Major hardware-software failures in defense acquisition programs have occurred both because components were expected to interoperate properly and they did not, as well as the fact that tools did not work as advertised.  Interoperability is required for network centric environments but reality has shown it very difficult to achieve.  A scalable, flexible, realistic synthetic testing environment is required for stressing tools against key benchmarks, assessment of the utility of tools by key program offices as well as use as a synthetic environment for testing tools against large systems (tens of millions of SLOC or larger) or systems-of-systems.

Software intensive systems are critical to meeting demands of current and future warfighting capabilities.  The costs of development of these systems -- in terms of dollars, time and human resources are increasing rapidly.

•  Approximately 40% of DoD’s RTD&E budget is currently spent on software development, and this is expected to increase. 

•  “The (Army FCS) software task alone is five times larger than that required for Joint Strike Fighter and ten times larger than the F-22, which after two decades is finally meeting its software requirements.”  -- Congressman Curt Weldon (April, 2004)

The complexity of current and emerging systems and systems of systems (SoS) requires breakthrough approaches in system development including new tools and methodologies spanning the entire system lifecycle from architecture design to system and SoS verification. One of the risk factors affecting the transitionability of such research is the difficulty of validating and verifying the functionality of research technologies against realistic problems. 

The poor collaboration among people working across the technology maturity lifecycle has created a “valley of disappointment” where DoD programs fail to adopt advanced technologies, regardless of their inherent promise. A regime of ad hoc policies and procedures for transitioning software research into software practice in avionics and other domains has arisen for technology transitioning.  

The expectation is that promising work funded by one organization early in the lifecycle, e.g., a DARPA program focusing on Science and Technology, will be perpetuated by another organization in the following phase, e.g., an AFRL program on Research & Engineering. The DoD has over 100 separate organizations engaged in technology transfer. The current strategy and the number of organizations involved makes it hard for knowledgeable people across the Technology Readiness Lifecycle - customers, researchers, engineers, and operators - to collaborate and plan for transition. 

Program Engineers typically view new development tools and runtime platforms as risky due to:

•  Insufficient evidence to prove their capabilities can payoff in production environments, 

•  Immature prototypes that lack stability, features, user support, training, and technology-to-tool chain integrations, and 

•  The absence of affordable and sustainable long-term commercial support plans. Software-Intensive Systems Producibility researchers typically assume others in government or commercial market place will address these problems. 

It is the intent of Systems and Software Test Track to help address all of the above issues.

Objective:

The overall objective of this Systems and Software Test Track (SSTT) BAA program is to provide an open framework environment where an assortment of experimental tools and products may be deployed and allowed to interact in real-time, interactive, evolutionary and interdependent means, thereby allowing rigorous testing of new technologies, methodologies and theories in support of the Software-Intensive Systems Producibility Initiative (SISPI).  The Systems and Software Test Track will facilitate testing of Software-Intensive Systems Producibility research products and methods, provide an environment for research of DoD embedded systems and software problems, provide an ability for university and industry leverage of technology development, and establish a capability for successful technology transition and transfer.

The SSTT is intended to be an open collaborative research and development environment to demonstrate, evaluate, and document the ability of novel tools, methods, techniques, and technologies to yield affordable and more predictable production of software intensive systems.  The SSTT system will bring together researchers, developers, and domain experts from different communities to de-fragment the knowledge necessary to achieve SISPI research, development and technology transition.  

The SSTT will be a system where SISPI researchers can test their research against relevant challenge problems, and where independent analysis of SISPI research can be preformed.  This independent analysis would enable the SSTT to support acquisition program offices and analyze utility of tools.  Also, SSTT users can bring their unsolved problems to provide challenges that drive SiSPI research where no such tools are available, or search for a solution by leveraging existing capabilities available in the SSTT.

The SSTT will have several logical roles of collaborating participants: Challenge Problem Provider (for providing challenge problems), Candidate Solution Provider (for providing candidate solutions to challenge problems), Experimenter (for running experiments and collecting experimental results), Collaborators (involved in collaborating on challenge problems, candidate solutions, and/or experiments), Solution Inquirer (actively searching for a needed capability) and SSTT Administrators (responsible for administering the SSTT infrastructure).  Various community participants may play one or more of these logical roles.  SSTT will enable Program Engineers from DoD Acquisition Programs to interact with SISPI Researchers from Industry Labs or Universities to define, discover and evaluate SISPI technology.

Phase 1 consisted of defining, developing, and documenting the Concept of Operations (CONOPS), a user-oriented document that describes system characteristics for a proposed system from the users' viewpoint; and defining, developing and documenting the architecture and the fundamental organization of the Systems and Software Test Track as embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution.  Initial concepts along with the final CONOPS and architectures were presented to representatives from Government, Industry and Academia.  Two awards were made and all documentation is available on the BCSW server (please contact steven.drager@rl.af.mil to request access).  The CONOPS is posted on FedBizOpps along with this modification 1.  Phase II is the environmental development and operations phase.  

The environment is open and available for use by developers as well as independent analysis by the facility operators.  This independent analysis allows the facility operators to be supportive to major defense acquisition program offices as well as analyzing the utility of tools.  Program offices may bring their unsolved problems to the test track for either help in solving or by looking for needed utility amongst the tools available.  Lastly, this synthetic environment should provide a place where big codes can be tested allowing requirements verification prior to production and deployment.  This risk reduction affords the ability to verify and validate functionality of today's complex software intensive systems while providing a realistic environment for researchers to verify their tools against realistic problems.

The Systems and Software Test Track provides a place (possibly virtual and not a single physical location) for experimental verification of Software-Intensive Systems Producibility technologies due to their novelty and the potential complexity of the underlying theories.  The experimental platforms incorporate software technology to instrument, monitor and test large-scale applications. Challenge problems for the open experimental platforms are accessible for all the research teams. The experimental platform research includes subtasks to conduct large-scale coordination experiments, and to develop methods and tools for evaluating aggregate performance of applications.  This environment provides a full range of collaborative technology challenges, run-time platforms and applications, experiments, evaluations, and demonstrations.  A Common infrastructure will enable control and data flow between both kinds of application components for a distributed environment.  The open experimentation environment will provide the fundamental reference architecture and underpinnings helping researchers to develop and test their designs as well as facilitates transition of promising technologies into production use.

Research Concentration Areas:
The primary goal of  Phase 2 is to research, design and implement the Systems and Software Test Track (SSTT) from the Concept of Operations (CONOPS).  The SSTT will facilitate testing of Software-Intensive Systems Producibility research products and methods, provide an environment for research of DoD embedded systems and software problems, provide an ability for university and industry leverage of technology development, and establish a capability for successful technology transition and transfer.  To ensure a broad range of collaborators offerors need to provide details on how researchers will collaborate with the SSTT.

The Architecture provides the ability to understand and control those elements of system design that capture the system’s utility, cost, and risk.  These elements could be the physical components of the system and their relationships, the logical components or enduring principles or patterns that create enduring structures.  The Architecture provides a rigorous definition of what constitutes the fundamental organization of the Systems and Software Test Track embodying all information regarding elemental relations, interactions and interfaces.

Areas to consider when developing Architecture components include, but are not limited to:

•  The environment to host, execute and test technology, both hardware environment (run time platform) and software environment (run time platform)

•  Details on how researchers will collaborate with the SSTT

•  Interfaces and collaborations

•  Mechanisms to support research and analysis of DoD problems including, but not limited to: software artifacts, benchmarks, executables, source code, design documents, requirements documents, examples, models, fault data, lessons learned, software construction files and tools

•  Data repositories for results, success stories, benchmarks, quantitative and qualitative results, software disaster studies defining problems and basic research areas, ability to upload/download artifacts

•  Measurement Techniques and Software Forensics

•  Metrics including reduced development time; ease in which domain experts and software engineers can interact; ease in which different domain experts can specify and design code independently of one another; usability, i.e., the 'naturalness' of the modeling language from which code is generated; ability of test engineers to modify and tune code in the field; accurate automated documentation in design

•  Mechanism for studying innovative systems and dynamic processes, not static snapshots

•  Populate, demonstrate, promote and improve the SSTT.  For the SSTT to be successful it must be populated with challenge problems, software producibility tools, collaboration tools, and administrative tools.

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Background:
It is increasingly difficult to create software to deal successfully with increased device and system complexity.  Moreover, networked distributed systems create vast increases in the scale and scope of information processing applications, exacerbating the challenges to the system engineers’ ability to specify, design, build, verify and test software. This situation is an emerging issue in information technology in general, but the requirement of military systems set them sharply apart from non-military applications in terms of reliability, robustness, security, interoperability and real time operation.

Business, government, and technical endeavors ranging from financial transactions to space missions increasingly require complex software systems to function correctly. The complexity of the software arises from stringent requirements (e.g., for reliability in performance and integrity of the data used), the need to support a range of interactions with the environment in real time, and/or certain structural features. These attributes make software difficult to produce.

Major hardware-software failures in defense acquisition programs have occurred both because components were expected to interoperate properly and they did not, as well as the fact that tools did not work as advertised.  Interoperability is required for network centric environments but reality has shown it very difficult to achieve.  A scalable, flexible, realistic synthetic testing environment is required for stressing tools against key benchmarks, assessment of the utility of tools by key program offices as well as use as a synthetic environment for testing tools against large systems (tens of millions of SLOC or larger) or systems-of-systems.

Software intensive systems are critical to meeting demands of current and future warfighting capabilities.  The costs of development of these systems -- in terms of dollars, time and human resources are increasing rapidly.

•	Approximately 40% of DoD’s RTD&E budget is currently spent on software development, and this is expected to increase. 

•	“The (Army FCS) software task alone is five times larger than that required for Joint Strike Fighter and ten times larger than the F-22, which after two decades is finally meeting its software requirements.”  -- Congressman Curt Weldon (April, 2004)

The complexity of current and emerging systems and systems of systems (SoS) requires breakthrough approaches in system development including new tools and methodologies spanning the entire system lifecycle from architecture design to system and SoS verification. One of the risk factors affecting the transitionability of such research is the difficulty of validating and verifying the functionality of research technologies against realistic problems. 

The poor collaboration among people working across the technology maturity lifecycle has created a “valley of disappointment” where DoD programs fail to adopt advanced technologies, regardless of their inherent promise. A regime of ad hoc policies and procedures for transitioning software research into software practice in avionics and other domains has arisen for technology transitioning.  

The expectation is that promising work funded by one organization early in the lifecycle, e.g., a DARPA program focusing on Science and Technology, will be perpetuated by another organization in the following phase, e.g., an AFRL program on Research & Engineering. The DoD has over 100 separate organizations engaged in technology transfer. The current strategy and the number of organizations involved makes it hard for knowledgeable people across the Technology Readiness Lifecycle - customers, researchers, engineers, and operators - to collaborate and plan for transition. 

Program Engineers typically view new development tools and runtime platforms as risky due to:

•	Insufficient evidence to prove their capabilities can payoff in production environments, 

•	Immature prototypes that lack stability, features, user support, training, and technology-to-tool chain integrations, and 

•	The absence of affordable and sustainable long-term commercial support plans. Software-Intensive Systems Producibility researchers typically assume others in government or commercial market place will address these problems. 

It is the intent of Systems and Software Test Track to help address all of the above issues.

Objective:

The overall objective of this Systems and Software Test Track (SSTT) BAA program is to provide an open framework environment where an assortment of experimental tools and products may be deployed and allowed to interact in real-time, interactive, evolutionary and interdependent means, thereby allowing rigorous testing of new technologies, methodologies and theories in support of the Software-Intensive Systems Producibility Initiative (SISPI).  The Systems and Software Test Track will facilitate testing of Software-Intensive Systems Producibility research products and methods, provide an environment for research of DoD embedded systems and software problems, provide an ability for university and industry leverage of technology development, and establish a capability for successful technology transition and transfer.

The SSTT is intended to be an open collaborative research and development environment to demonstrate, evaluate, and document the ability of novel tools, methods, techniques, and technologies to yield affordable and more predictable production of software intensive systems.  The SSTT system will bring together researchers, developers, and domain experts from different communities to de-fragment the knowledge necessary to achieve SISPI research, development and technology transition.  

The SSTT will be a system where SISPI researchers can test their research against relevant challenge problems, and where independent analysis of SISPI research can be preformed.  This independent analysis would enable the SSTT to support acquisition program offices and analyze utility of tools.  Also, SSTT users can bring their unsolved problems to provide challenges that drive SiSPI research where no such tools are available, or search for a solution by leveraging existing capabilities available in the SSTT.

 The SSTT will have several logical roles of collaborating participants: Challenge Problem Provider (for providing challenge problems), Candidate Solution Provider (for providing candidate solutions to challenge problems), Experimenter (for running experiments and collecting experimental results), Collaborators (involved in collaborating on challenge problems, candidate solutions, and/or experiments), Solution Inquirer (actively searching for a needed capability) and SSTT Administrators (responsible for administering the SSTT infrastructure).  Various community participants may play one or more of these logical roles.  SSTT will enable Program Engineers from DoD Acquisition Programs to interact with SISPI Researchers from Industry Labs or Universities to define, discover and evaluate SISPI technology.

 Phase 1 consisted of defining, developing, and documenting the Concept of Operations (CONOPS), a user-oriented document that describes system characteristics for a proposed system from the users' viewpoint; and defining, developing and documenting the architecture and the fundamental organization of the Systems and Software Test Track as embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution.  Initial concepts along with the final CONOPS and architectures were presented to representatives from Government, Industry and Academia.  Two awards were made and all documentation is available on the BCSW server (please contact steven.drager@rl.af.mil to request access).  The CONOPS is posted on FedBizOpps along with this modification 1.  Phase II is the environmental development and operations phase.  

The environment is open and available for use by developers as well as independent analysis by the facility operators.  This independent analysis allows the facility operators to be supportive to major defense acquisition program offices as well as analyzing the utility of tools.  Program offices may bring their unsolved problems to the test track for either help in solving or by looking for needed utility amongst the tools available.  Lastly, this synthetic environment should provide a place where big codes can be tested allowing requirements verification prior to production and deployment.  This risk reduction affords the ability to verify and validate functionality of today's complex software intensive systems while providing a realistic environment for researchers to verify their tools against realistic problems.

The Systems and Software Test Track provides a place (possibly virtual and not a single physical location) for experimental verification of Software-Intensive Systems Producibility technologies due to their novelty and the potential complexity of the underlying theories.  The experimental platforms incorporate software technology to instrument, monitor and test large-scale applications.

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Background:
It is increasingly difficult to create software to deal successfully with increased device and system complexity.  Moreover, networked distributed systems create vast increases in the scale and scope of information processing applications, exacerbating the challenges to the system engineers’ ability to specify, design, build, verify and test software. This situation is an emerging issue in information technology in general, but the requirement of military systems set them sharply apart from non-military applications in terms of reliability, robustness, security, interoperability and real time operation.

Business, government, and technical endeavors ranging from financial transactions to space missions increasingly require complex software systems to function correctly. The complexity of the software arises from stringent requirements (e.g., for reliability in performance and integrity of the data used), the need to support a range of interactions with the environment in real time, and/or certain structural features. These attributes make software difficult to produce.

Major hardware-software failures in defense acquisition programs have occurred both because components were expected to interoperate properly and they did not, as well as the fact that tools did not work as advertised.  Interoperability is required for network centric environments but reality has shown it very difficult to achieve.  A scalable, flexible, realistic synthetic testing environment is required for stressing tools against key benchmarks, assessment of the utility of tools by key program offices as well as use as a synthetic environment for testing tools against large systems (tens of millions of SLOC or larger) or systems-of-systems.

Software intensive systems are critical to meeting demands of current and future warfighting capabilities.  The costs of development of these systems -- in terms of dollars, time and human resources are increasing rapidly.

•	Approximately 40% of DoD’s RTD&E budget is currently spent on software development, and this is expected to increase. 

•	“The (Army FCS) software task alone is five times larger than that required for Joint Strike Fighter and ten times larger than the F-22, which after two decades is finally meeting its software requirements.”  -- Congressman Curt Weldon (April, 2004)

The complexity of current and emerging systems and systems of systems (SoS) requires breakthrough approaches in system development including new tools and methodologies spanning the entire system lifecycle from architecture design to system and SoS verification. One of the risk factors affecting the transitionability of such research is the difficulty of validating and verifying the functionality of research technologies against realistic problems. 

The poor collaboration among people working across the technology maturity lifecycle has created a “valley of disappointment” where DoD programs fail to adopt advanced technologies, regardless of their inherent promise. A regime of ad hoc policies and procedures for transitioning software research into software practice in avionics and other domains has arisen for technology transitioning.  

The expectation is that promising work funded by one organization early in the lifecycle, e.g., a DARPA program focusing on Science and Technology, will be perpetuated by another organization in the following phase, e.g., an AFRL program on Research & Engineering. The DoD has over 100 separate organizations engaged in technology transfer. The current strategy and the number of organizations involved makes it hard for knowledgeable people across the Technology Readiness Lifecycle - customers, researchers, engineers, and operators - to collaborate and plan for transition. 

Program Engineers typically view new development tools and runtime platforms as risky due to:

•	Insufficient evidence to prove their capabilities can payoff in production environments, 

•	Immature prototypes that lack stability, features, user support, training, and technology-to-tool chain integrations, and 

•	The absence of affordable and sustainable long-term commercial support plans. Software-Intensive Systems Producibility researchers typically assume others in government or commercial market place will address these problems. 

It is the intent of Systems and Software Test Track to help address all of the above issues.

Objective:

The overall objective of this Systems and Software Test Track (SSTT) BAA program is to provide an open framework environment where an assortment of experimental tools and products may be deployed and allowed to interact in real-time, interactive, evolutionary and interdependent means, thereby allowing rigorous testing of new technologies, methodologies and theories in support of the Software-Intensive Systems Producibility Initiative (SISPI).  The Systems and Software Test Track will facilitate testing of Software-Intensive Systems Producibility research products and methods, provide an environment for research of DoD embedded systems and software problems, provide an ability for university and industry leverage of technology development, and establish a capability for successful technology transition and transfer.

The SSTT is intended to be an open collaborative research and development environment to demonstrate, evaluate, and document the ability of novel tools, methods, techniques, and technologies to yield affordable and more predictable production of software intensive systems.  The SSTT system will bring together researchers, developers, and domain experts from different communities to de-fragment the knowledge necessary to achieve SISPI research, development and technology transition.  

The SSTT will be a system where SISPI researchers can test their research against relevant challenge problems, and where independent analysis of SISPI research can be preformed.  This independent analysis would enable the SSTT to support acquisition program offices and analyze utility of tools.  Also, SSTT users can bring their unsolved problems to provide challenges that drive SiSPI research where no such tools are available, or search for a solution by leveraging existing capabilities available in the SSTT.

 The SSTT will have several logical roles of collaborating participants: Challenge Problem Provider (for providing challenge problems), Candidate Solution Provider (for providing candidate solutions to challenge problems), Experimenter (for running experiments and collecting experimental results), Collaborators (involved in collaborating on challenge problems, candidate solutions, and/or experiments), Solution Inquirer (actively searching for a needed capability) and SSTT Administrators (responsible for administering the SSTT infrastructure).  Various community participants may play one or more of these logical roles.  SSTT will enable Program Engineers from DoD Acquisition Programs to interact with SISPI Researchers from Industry Labs or Universities to define, discover and evaluate SISPI technology.

 Phase 1 consisted of defining, developing, and documenting the Concept of Operations (CONOPS), a user-oriented document that describes system characteristics for a proposed system from the users' viewpoint; and defining, developing and documenting the architecture and the fundamental organization of the Systems and Software Test Track as embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution.  Initial concepts along with the final CONOPS and architectures were presented to representatives from Government, Industry and Academia.  Two awards were made and all documentation is available on the BCSW server (please contact steven.drager@rl.af.mil to request access).  The CONOPS is posted on FedBizOpps along with this modification 1.  Phase II is the environmental development and operations phase.  

The environment is open and available for use by developers as well as independent analysis by the facility operators.  This independent analysis allows the facility operators to be supportive to major defense acquisition program offices as well as analyzing the utility of tools.  Program offices may bring their unsolved problems to the test track for either help in solving or by looking for needed utility amongst the tools available.  Lastly, this synthetic environment should provide a place where big codes can be tested allowing requirements verification prior to production and deployment.  This risk reduction affords the ability to verify and validate functionality of today's complex software intensive systems while providing a realistic environment for researchers to verify their tools against realistic problems.

The Systems and Software Test Track provides a place (possibly virtual and not a single physical location) for experimental verification of Software-Intensive Systems Producibility technologies due to their novelty and the potential complexity of the underlying theories.  The experimental platforms incorporate software technology to instrument, monitor and test large-scale applications. Challenge problems for the open experimental platforms are accessible for all the research teams. The experimental platform research includes subtasks to conduct large-scale coordination experiments, and to develop methods and tools for evaluating aggregate performance of applications.  This environment provides a full range of collaborative technology challenges, run-time platforms and applications, experiments, evaluations, and demonstrations.  A Common infrastructure will enable control and data flow between both kinds of application components for a distributed environment.  The open experimentation environment will provide the fundamental reference architecture and underpinnings helping researchers to develop and test their designs as well as facilitates transition of promising technologies into production use.

Research Concentration Areas:
The primary goal of  Phase 2 is to research, design and implement the Systems and Software Test Track (SSTT) from the Concept of Operations (CONOPS).  The SSTT will facilitate testing of Software-Intensive Systems Producibility research products and methods, provide an environment for research of DoD embedded systems and software problems, provide an ability for university and industry leverage of technology development, and establish a capability for successful technology transition and transfer.  To ensure a broad range of collaborators offerors need to provide details on how researchers will collaborate with the SSTT.

The Architecture provides the ability to understand and control those elements of system design that capture the system’s utility, cost, and risk.  These elements could be the physical components of the system and their relationships, the logical components or enduring principles or patterns that create enduring structures.  The Architecture provides a rigorous definition of what constitutes the fundamental organization of the Systems and Software Test Track embodying all information regarding elemental relations, interactions and interfaces.

Areas to consider when developing Architecture components include, but are not limited to:
•	The environment to host, execute and test technology, both hardware environment (run time platform) and software environment (run time platform)
•	Details on how researchers will collaborate with the SSTT
•	Interfaces and collaborations
•	Mechanisms to support research and analysis of DoD problems including, but not limited to: software artifacts, benchmarks, executables, source code, design documents, requirements documents, examples, models, fault data, lessons learned, software construction files and tools
•	Data repositories for results, success stories, benchmarks, quantitative and qualitative results, software disaster studies defining problems and basic research areas, ability to upload/download artifacts
•	Measurement Techniques and Software Forensics
•	Metrics including reduced development time; ease in which domain experts and software engineers can interact; ease in which different domain experts can specify and design code independently of one another; usability, i.e., the 'naturalness' of the modeling language from which code is generated; ability of test engineers to modify and tune code in the field; accurate automated documentation in design
•	Mechanism for studying innovative systems and dynamic processes, not static snapshots
•	Populate, demonstrate, promote and improve the SSTT.  For the SSTT to be successful it must be populated with challenge problems, software producibility tools, collaboration tools, and administrative tools.

REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTIONT-1A Aircraft Modification to Add CSO Training Capability
PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION:
           We are conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirement to modify T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include a Combat Systems Officer (CSO) training station and generate the associated technical data. The CSO will combine Navigator, Electronic Warfare and Weapons System Officer training using specially configured T-1A aircraft and ground based training assets.  Twenty-one T-1A aircraft will be modified with global positioning system driven simulated radar display and a simulated Radar Warning Receiver (ALR-69) display in the flight deck right seat position with instructor controls at the jump seat position.  An additional CSO and instructor position will be located in the cabin using the T-25 Simulator for Electronic Combat Training (SECT) or some other device with similar capabilities.  The ground based training system portion consists of up to three operational flight trainers.  The flight trainers will not be part of this acquisition.    The CSO system needs to be fielded at the Naval Air Station, Pensacola in time to support training as the T-43 Training System shuts down at Randolph AFB beginning in 2010.  Ten modified aircraft are required for Initial Operational capability (IOC) in 2010 with all 21 aircraft modified and in place for Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 2011.
	Hawker Beechcraft Corporation holds the FAA Type Certificate for the aircraft and the Government does not have data rights for the technical / engineering data on the aircraft.  The CSO solution must be FAA certified as integrated into the T-1 aircraft.

<DESC><p>The sustainment of Eagle Vision Data Integration Segment (DIS) systems will include: hardware maintenance, software maintenance, security accreditation, configuration management, systems engineering, training, and potential updates to the DIS commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software and hardware baseline. This effort will also include the procurement of a complete DIS system for EV 6 and a configured laptop for Air Force Director of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Applications (AF/A2U) located at the Pentagon. Eagle Vision is the only deployable commercial ground station in DOD that can directly receive and process panchromatic/multispectral/SAR imagery from commercial remote-sensing satellites. Eagle Vision provides imagery products for military operations, disaster relief and homeland defense, especially for use in combat commander mission planning/rehearsal and intelligence gathering systems. DIS imagery processing includes both industry standard and government-specific output formats such as GeoTIFF, JPEG 2000, NITF 2.1, and RPF CIB. The DIS resides at each of five geographically-separated Eagle Vision sites: Ramstein Air Base Germany, San Diego, CA, Eastover, SC, Honolulu, HI, and Montgomery, AL. Each DIS system (except for EV 6 and AF/A2U) comprises six independent workstations (mix of desktops and laptops), a Local Area Network (LAN), shared storage devices, printers, and plotters. Each workstation contains multiple commodity COTS applications software for imagery, office automation, and geospatial processing applications, including ERDAS Imagine and ESRI ArcGIS. The sustainment effort will also support one workstation configured with all DIS software at AF/A2U, once those systems are procured. Additional informational about the locations and hardware/software configuration of the DIS systems may be found on the Hanscom Electronic Request for Proposal Bulletin Board (HERBB), http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil/. Under business opportunities, choose systems/Hanscom for type and location. The information ! can be found under Eagle Vision Data Integration Segment (DIS).</p>

<DESC>The description is corrected to read as follows:
The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to modify Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract N00140-02-D-1184, with Northrop Grumman Defense Missions Systems (NGDMS) of Reston, Virginia, to provide non-personal, Business Process Reengineering Analysis, Integration, Engineering, Knowledge Management, and Activity Base Cost Support Services to the United States Joint Forces Command and its subordinate Joint activities, for the period of performance 23 July 2008 through 31 March 2009.  The estimated total support for the two-month period is 56,627 hours.  Overtime is not anticipated.  The services are considered critical and vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption, pending competitive award of a follow-on solicitation.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  NGDMS is the only known source that has the necessary contract infrastructure, including specialized experience, expertise, past performance, trained personnel, and security clearances in place to perform all required services, without interruption, starting 23 July 2008, at the USJFCOM.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or to submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all proposals received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Government will not pay for information received.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System code and size standard are 541611 and $6.5M, respectively.  
The NECO website has a "submit bid" button next to the solicitation number. DO NOT use the "submit bid" button on NECO to submit a response to this notice. Either fax your response to 215-697-5418 or email to anita.spriggs@navy.mil. All questions shall be in writing.

<DESC>Acquisition Overview This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid (IFB), request for quotation (RFQ), request for proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Govern ment use of such information.  The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or part, any contractor input resulting from this request.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to aw ard a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort.  The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its overall acquisition strategy, statement of work, statement of objectives, and performance specifi cations.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government does not intend to award a contract or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in respo nse to this RFI. This request for information (RFI) is to invite industry comment on a potential change in the Acquisition Strategy (AS) for the Drivers Vision Enhancer  Family of Systems (DVE-FOS).  PM NV/RSTA and PM FLIR are in the process of analyzing alternatives lea ding to the development of a FY08-FY13 program plan and acquisition strategy for the DVE-FOS consisting of the DVE, DVE-LITE and DVE-Forward Activity Detection System (DVE-FADS).  Performance and technical specifications for each product and other pertinen t requirements documents may be accessed in the DVE reading room located on the IBOP, Solicitation Number W15P7T-08-R-S369.  The government encourages interested parties to provide comments with regard to the feasibility of the DVE-FOS strategies identifie d herein.  Additionally, submission of alternative strategies, suggestions for acceleration of system qualifications, recommendations for economic ordering quantities, economical range quantity breaks, best value discriminators, realistic production ramp u p, and monthly production sustainment quantities are of significant interest to the government. The notional DVE-FOS program plan and acquisition strategy is intended to cover system level requirements for the next five (5) fiscal years.  It is expected that the government will acquire in excess of 17,800 DVE-FOS systems over a five (5) year performa nce period.  The PM intends to include requirements for DVE-FOS systems, installation kits, spare parts, transportation cases, system qualification testing, and engineering services.  The government plans to conduct a best value competition and intends to reserve the right to make multiple Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity awards.  DVE-FOS systems and spares will be priced on a firm fixed price basis with range quantities established for each program year.  System qualification testing will also be pr iced on a firm fixed price basis and a separate line item for engineering services will be included on a time and materials basis.  Considerations for the best value competition will place emphasis on mature technical solutions with low programmatic risk; delivery schedule; supportability; backward compatibility with legacy systems; potential for technology enhancements and reliability growth; production capacity and ability to ramp up and sustain high volume production with minimum advance notice.  It is e nvisioned that all DVE-FOS products will have to be qualified prior to delivery unless the government grants a waiver.  Notional delivery schedules for all hardware products will be three (3) months after receipt of order.  The government anticipates that successful offerors will have to demonstrate their capacity to maintain and sustain an accelerated monthly production ramp up rate of 1,000 systems per month. A Government Industry Day will be held 18 December 2007, at Ft. Belvoir, VA, within the Night Vision Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) compound, building 309, in the Virtual Prototyping and Simulations (VPS) arena.  Industry Day will begin with an int roductory briefing on the governments plans for DVE-FOS at 0900 hrs EST.   After the government briefing, interested parties will have the opportunity to meet with Government representatives for no more than 30 minutes with the government to discuss their DVE-FOS acquisition strategy considerations.  Request to schedule an indust ry one-on-one with the Government must be submitted at the same time as registration for the event. Each industry participant will be limited to a maximum of three (3) attendees. The government will provide the scheduled times for the one-on-one sessions a t the Industry Day briefing.  Each industry participant is responsible for providing their own copies of briefing materials during their session. Any questions regarding this RFI must be submitted by email to the contract specialist, Robert Catania (robert.catania@us.army.mil).  The briefing materials will be posted to the IBOP on or about 6 December 2007 in the DVE Reading Room under the Solicitati on folder W15P7T-08-R-S369.  Responses to the DVE-FOS RFI are due to Robert Catania (robert.catania@us.army.mil), NLT 1600hrs EST on 14 December 2007. Meeting requests and registration must be submitted to Patrick Schertler (patrick.schertler@conus.army.mil) no later than 1600 hrs EST on 12 December 2007. Each registration shall contain company name, business unit, address, and a list of attendees with nationality.  Due to security approval timelines, all non-US companies must utilize US citizen representatives.  Industry participants are reminded that it m ay take up to one hour to get through Ft. Belvoir and NVESD compound security. Scope See:  (12042007) DVE-FOS RFI (Technical Overview).doc, located on the IBOP in Solicitation folder W15P7T-08-R-S369.

<DESC>PLEASE NOTE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SUPERSEDES THE PREVIOUS PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE.
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has been involved with aquifer monitoring at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) since the early 1950s.  Hundreds of monitoring wells have been drilled on and around the INL to examine the fate and transport of contaminants and to characterize the regional aquifer system.  In collaboration with the INL, the USGS has started a new phase in aquifer monitoring that includes the use of deep (up to 1,400 feet) vertical monitoring systems that allow for the collection of pressure, temperature, and water quality data at specific depths within a single borehole.  Using a series of inflatable packers to seal the open-borehole, data can be collected and analyzed that will add 3-dimensional control for ongoing numerical modeling.  Results will be used to verify where contaminants are moving as they disperse through the aquifer.  
Open boreholes do not allow for measurement of vertical variation in pressure, temperature, or water quality.  Mixing of water chemistry and pressure occurs inside of open boreholes and can change or dilute the pressure or water chemistry.  To better characterize the shallow, intermediate, and deep aquifer system of the eastern Snake River Plain, a vertical monitoring system is needed that meets borehole diameter limitations (3.5 to 4.8 inch) and that can monitor at depths 1,400 feet or greater where the water table can exceed 600 feet.  
To meet this need, the USGS intends to award a non-competitive purchase order to Schlumberger for additional components that will be used with our existing Westbay MP55 system network.  These additional components include (82 each) MP55 Casting 1 (3M/10F), (80 each) MP55 Regular Coupling, (27 each) MP55 Measurement Ports, (2 each) MP55 End Plug, (32 each) MP55 Packer - 100mm, plastic mandrel, and (2 each) Well Head Completion Kit of MP55.  This solicitation will be issued on a noncompetitive basis in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b)(1) and the procedures of FAR Part 12, entitled "Acquisition of Commercial Items."  The USGS has an existing inventory of Westbay components and has already invested significant dollars in training and ancillary support for that equipment.  Further, the USGS is not aware of any other manufacturer currently making equipment that is capable of meeting our need at the required depth and in the small-diameter borehole that we are using.      
In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(13), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency, to the Contract Specialist no later than the closing date of this announcement.  All responses must be in writing by email to the Contract Specialist at sklingler@usgs.gov.   
This notice and any resulting solicitation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-26, effective 12 June 2008.
NAICS 334519 - Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing.  No numbered notes apply.
