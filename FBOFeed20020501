<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to negotiate a sole source, commercial item contract to FATS, of Swannee, GA.  FATS will be responsible for creating and producing various training scenarios that will be utilized with the United States Marine Corps? (USMC) Indoor Simulated Marksmanship Trainer (ISMT).  The ISMT training involves both marksmanship and shoot/no-shoot decision-making.  Depending on the specific training objective, different scenarios will be used.  A scenario consists of software that specifies a variety of information for a training session including starting conditions (e.g., location of participants in simulated environment), participants (e.g., trainees, hostiles, friendlies, neutrals), types of weapons, and behavior of neutrals, friendlies and hostiles.

As the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the ISMT, FATS, is the only source that currently possesses the technical expertise, as well as the processes and standards necessary to successfully complete the software scenarios.  Furthermore, it has been determined that the introduction of software scenarios into ISMT by a company other than FATS would corrupt the ISMT warranty and service agreements the USMC currently has with FATS.

No RFP is available for competitive proposal; however, interested parties may submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement, to include descriptive literature demonstrating that the company is a FATS Value Added Reseller with OEM certified software developers and pricing, within 15 days of this announcement to the contact person listed above.  

This announcement is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any information received by the date identified above will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Coastal Systems Station, Dahlgren Division, NSWC, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit on a sole source basis from Anteon Corporation two prototypes of the AN/AQS-20X towed body assembly maintenance stands.  The design is based upon modifications to an existing Mark 21 (Mk 21) maintenance stand as previously developed by Anteon under a NAVSEA order (delivery order T0701BG0511) under GSA number GS-23F-0076K. This already completed design effort represents approximately 75% of the total design effort. It is not reasonable to expect that competition can result in sufficient savings to offset the need for any other contractor to duplicate this design effort. Therefore, Anteon is the only company that can complete the design and produce the initial prototype units of these AN/AQS-20X maintenance stands. A complete technical data package is being procured as part of this actio n to allow competitive procurement of the production stands. Note 22 applies. NAICS is 541330 and the size standard is 750 employees.

Biologic determinants that may affect HIV transmission include virus-related factors such as viral fitness and selective pressure against transmission of drug-resistant strains as well as host-related factors, which may include genetic and immunologic characteristics.  This contract will be for the enrollment of cohorts consisting of two types of partner-pairs:  persons who have been recently infected with HIV and their HIV-infected source partners, and persons who have been recently exposed to HIV but not infected and their HIV-infected partners.  Participants in this study are identified through existing infrastructure, interviewed and asked to furnish biologic samples.  Results of these studies will be used to further knowledge about innate and acquired factors that may protect against sexual and injection drug-related HIV transmission.

The awarded contract shall be for a period of 48 months.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541710.  See Numbered Note 26.

Upon issuance, the RFP will be available on the Internet at www.eps.gov.  The date specified for receipt of offers will be approximately 30 days after the solicitation issue date. The solicitation issue date will be on or about May 15, 2002.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command is the lead procuring activity on a joint U.S. Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps requirement for a Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN).  This requirement will be procured utilizing best value, full and open competition.  The intent of the JWARN program is to provide the Joint Forces with a comprehensive analysis and response capability to minimize the effects of hostile Nuclear Biological Chemical (NBC) attacks or accidents/incidents.  Currently, the NBC community follows manual procedures to initiate the warning and reporting of NBC threats and hazards.  JWARN will automate these functions, as well as the transfer of NBC detector/sensor data to the Command and Control Center or NBC Control Centers.  The consolidated information, in conjunction with weather and Position Location Information (PLI), will support the development of NBC warnings, contaminated area predictions and overlays showing areas of actual contamination (in accordance with ATP-45).  The NBC information then automatically becomes a part of the Commander's Critical Information Requirements (CCIR), and Essential Elements of Information (EEI) supporting the decision making process.  In this manner, JWARN will support the near-real time warning and reporting of NBC attacks.  Furthermore, JWARN data will support the generation of plans and reports, and provide access to specific NBC information to improve the efficiency of warning and reporting procedures.  
The JWARN program is using an evolutionary acquisition approach that divides the program into three (3) blocks and a Pre-Planned Product Improvement effort to meet the emerging needs of the warfighter.  Acquisition of Block I software quantities has been completed.  This solicitation supports the procurement of Block II System Development and Demonstration (SDD), and Block III SDD and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) which encompasses the entire scope cited above, on a Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) basis with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) options for training and technical support.  The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) follow-on production contract to the successful offeror for this Block II and III SDD effort. A draft solicitation, Statement of Work, and Performance Specification will be posted to the JWARN website NLT 6 May 2002.  Questions and comments from industry must be submitted to the POC indicated herein NLT 14 May 2002.  The JWARN website is located at www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/mcscctq/oppor.htm

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis with Blue Cross Blue Shield (BC/BS) Association, 225 North Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60601-7680, for a contract for the "Division of Medicine and Dentistry (DMD), Bureau of Health Professions (BHPr)."  This is a notice of intent, not a request for competitive proposals.

In order for the Division of Medicine and Dentistry, BHPr/HRSA to comply with statutory requirements of the annual assessment of full-time equivalent (FTE) resident counts submitted by participating Children's Hospitals to the Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) Payment Program, the CHGME Payment Program requires a unified Departmental process, an approach which is minimally burdensome to hospitals, and a process which is administratively feasible through the availability of proprietary and otherwise protected data.  BC/BS through its Medicare Fiscal Intermediaries (FIs) currently possesses the protected unique identifier data required to fully conduct the assessment of FTE counts for the CHGME Payment Program.  Through existing relationships with the same FIs utilized by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), efficiency is gained, burden to the hospitals is minimized, and a unified approach by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to fund graduate medical education is assured.  The decision to award the contract to BC/BS is based on the unique capabilities that BC/BS has developed and its understanding and experience with its capability to assess the FTE resident count data submitted by children's teaching hospitals for the CHGME Payment Program.  In addition, BC/BS has the unique capability to assess the data submitted by children's teaching hospitals for the purpose of the statutorily authorized reconciliation of FTE resident counts submitted by hospitals on an annual application to the CHGME Payment Program.  Therefore, the Government has determined that BC/BS is the only central source having the experience and expertise necessary to provide the work and services required under this contract.  The contact person for this acquisition is:  Frantz Y. Richard, Contracting Officer, HRSA Acquisitions Branch, DGPM/OMPS/HRSA, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 13A-19, Rockville, MD 20857-5600; phone number 301-443-0687; FAX 301-443-6038.  The electronic mailing address is: frichard@hrsa.gov.  See note 22.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, Air Vehicles Directorate, Control Sciences Division (AFRL/VACC) solicits research proposals for Distributed Infocentric Reliable Control Technology (DIReCT).  This effort will investigate and document infocentric requirements and develop methods for reliable control of UAVs.  Current technology does not provide a clear understanding of the information quality requirements for these autonomous control systems and thus they are not robust to degraded information and are not as reliable as desired. Current technology has yet to extend existing redundancy management algorithms to the management of distributed redundancy in a package of UAVs to ensure quality information and quality decisions.  This work will provide key design criteria to enable the reduction of mishaps of UAVs through reliability approaching that of manned systems.  Interested offerors may view and/or download the full PRDA/BAA  solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) homepage at http://www.eps.gov/. Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a contract for the "Study of the 'Unnatural' History of HIV" in the era of highly effective human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment.  The purpose of this project is to study the many manifestations, morbidities, and mortalities of HIV in the post-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era (since 1996), and to incorporate HIV prevention activities into HIV medical care.  Studies such as the HIV Outpatient Study (HOPS), the AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG), Adult Spectrum of Disease (ASD) and other cohorts are providing useful information about the long-term sequelae of HIV infection in this recent era of effective HIV therapies.  However, these studies are not designed to regularly and intensively monitor the several organ systems that may be affected by HIV or its therapy, or to incorporate HIV prevention messages and counseling.  Thus, the need for a fixed cohort study of well-treated, well-followed HIV-infected patients who are seen, examined, interviewed, and counseled at regular intervals, and who are tested and examined by a wide range of (non-invasive) tests, is evident.  This project will mainly: 1) supplement laboratory tests and clinical evaluations currently reimbursed by private insurance, public funds (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid) and from other sources; 2) systematize patient visits and evaluation to occur at least once every six months; and 3) to incorporate regular HIV primary prevention--by screening for risk behaviors and STDs and providing prevention messages-into HIV clinical care.  Accordingly, funding will be to augment and standardize applicant's already ongoing clinical activities.

The awarded contract shall be for a period of five (5) years, performed in five annual phases of 12 months each.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541710.  See Numbered Note 26.

Upon issuance, the RFP will be available on the Internet at www.eps.gov.  The date specified for receipt of offers will be approximately 30 days after the solicitation issue date. The solicitation issue date will be on or about May 15, 2002.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a contract for the "Vaccine Safety Surveillance and Assessment Projects."  The projects are divided into two major tasks - Task 1 entitled "Vaccine Safety Datalink" (VSD); and Task 2 entitled "Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Centers."  The VSD and CISA projects are in keeping with the mission of National Immunization Program (NIP) in directing epidemiologic surveillance and research to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of vaccines recommended or intended for routine human use.  These projects are authorized by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 Amendment to the Public Health Service Act.  Task 1 (VSD) provides scientific assessment of the potential risks, costs, and benefits of vaccination for policy purposes. VSD is broken into two parts.  Part A - infants, children, and adolescents <  17 years old; and Part B - Adults 18 and over.  Beginning in 1991 the CDC/NIP formed partnerships with several large health maintenance organizations to continually evaluate vaccine safety.  Over the ensuing 10 years, medical records of the VSD population have been used to study potential causal relationships between immunization and adverse events.  Task 2 (CISA) is to establish academic clinical centers of excellence with expertise in vaccine safety.  The CISA network, initially funded as a cooperative agreement in 2001, develops protocols for the clinical assessment, diagnosis and management of vaccination- complications, thus seeking to improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of rare vaccine adverse events at the individual patient level.  

The awarded contract shall be incrementally funded for a period of ten (10) years.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541710.  See Numbered Note 26.

Upon issuance, the RFP will be available on the Internet at www.eps.gov.  The date specified for receipt of offers will be approximately 40 days after the solicitation issue date. The solicitation issue date will be on or about May 15, 2002.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for aircraft payload services using the Proteus aircraft to fly high-altitude mission sorties out of various locations throughout the experiment performance period. The services will include integration of multiple sensors into the NASA-owned Prototype Airborne Science Instrumentation Carrier (PASIC) research instrumentation pod, engineering checkout, deployment to base of operations, payload removal following mission completion, and post-mission support by providing aircraft-unique flight data. The PASIC pod is uniquely engineered to fit the Proteus aircraft. Mission flight altitudes will range from a few hundred feet to above 55,000 feet.  The performance period for the intended Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) purchase order is a one-year base period and two, one-year Options.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)using FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Scaled Composites, LLC which is the only responsible source and no other services will satisfy the agency's requirements.  It would take a substantial duplication of time and money for another company to become qualified to provide the type of high-altitude aircraft services required and these costs are not expected to be recoved through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 10, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to modify contract number M67854-02-D-2000 with Litton Systems, Inc. (Litton Integrated Systems Division), Northridge, California to increase the scope to allow for engineering support and improvements to the Air Forces' AN/TYQ-23, Modular Control Equipment (MCE).   The MCE is the USAF equivalent to the USMC's AN/TYQ-23(V)4 Tactical Air Operations Module (TAOM).  The AN/TYQ-23 is a transportable, modularized, automated command and control element that provides automatic acquisition, identification and tracking of all aircraft, Air Breathing Targets (ABT) and Theater Ballistic Missiles (TBM) and directs air defense for its area of responsibility.  The TAOM and the MCE were manufactured by Litton under a USAF/USMC Joint Program.  The USMC recently completed upgrade of the system to (V)4 configuration under contract M67854-98-C-2111.  The USAF intends to undergo similar enhancements to the MCE to address added operational requirements, migration to an open system architecture, and correction of logistically unsupportable high failure items.  The modification will include all effort required to upgrade the MCE to (V)3a configuration.  The authority for this action is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The technical data package related to the actions described above are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  No RFP is available for competitive bidding; however, interested parties are encouraged to submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement within forty-five days after publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No telephonic requests will be accepted.  All communications shall be in writing to the Contract Specialist shown below.  Proprietary information shall be clearly identified as such and will be protected.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The United States (U. S.) Government, and specifically, the Minerals Management Service (MMS), a bureau within the U. S. Department of the Interior, has jurisdiction over all mineral resources on the Federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Public Law 103-426, enacted October 31, 1994, gave the MMS the authority to convey, on a noncompetitive basis, the rights to OCS sand, gravel, or shell resources for shore protection, beach or wetlands restoration projects, or for use in construction projects funded in whole or part or authorized by the Federal Government. Since enactment of PL 103-426, MMS has provided Federal sand for beach nourishment projects in New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana. In many of the areas in which Federal sand is presently being used or for areas where the use of Federal sand for beach nourishment material is being considered, or in areas where coarse sand and gravel deposits are known to exist and may be potential sources of construction aggregate, submerged archaeological properties may also be present. These properties could consist of drowned prehistoric or historic terrestrial sites or historic shipwrecks. In the case of shipwrecks, some of them are considered significant under criteria established for the National Register of Historic Places, others are not. Whether the wrecks are historic in nature or not however, shipwrecks and jetties are a focal point for certain fish and are now considered potential Essential Fisheries Habitat by the National Marine Fisheries Service, especially if these structures are the only hard habitat for miles around. Shipwreck sites are also used extensively by sport divers, recreational fishermen, and commercial fishermen. Offshore dredging has been known to result in the burial of wrecks by as much as 10 feet of sand and recovery is unlikely given the replenishment schedules and reuse of many borrow areas over a period of time. There have also been recent instances of shipwreck and historic artifact damage caused as a result of offshore dredging operations. Because of the potential for damage to important offshore archaeological resources, MMS intends to award a contract to examine the efficacy of the present buffer zones allocated for archaeological sites and their ability to protect archaeological resources. In addition, there is a need to examine the adequacy of current MMS requirements for archaeological surveys relative to the identification and mapping of archaeological properties within sand lease areas, given the scale and complexity of a typical beach dredging or offshore construction aggregate operation. SCOPE OF WORK: The Contractor will be required to review current MMS practices and procedures for the protection of submerged prehistoric and historic sites and shipwrecks during offshore dredging operations and to provide a plan and proposed specifications by which the MMS can ensure that significant drowned prehistoric and historic sites and shipwrecks that exist within potential Federal OCS sand borrow areas or aggregate areas are not adversely impacted by offshore dredging operations. This work will entail: a worldwide search of the existing literature base relative to submerged prehistoric or historic site and shipwreck damage or disturbance resulting from offshore dredging operations; a technological and engineering review of current dredging practices and procedures for the various types of dredges used in beach nourishment and construction aggregate dredging; a worldwide review of current practices and procedures to mitigate against adverse impacts to submerged prehistoric or historic sites, known shipwrecks, and possible shipwreck sites during offshore dredging operations; a review and analysis of the current MMS specifications for archaeological surveys in advance of offshore dredging operations proposed for the Federal waters; and a review of current MMS procedures for protecting submerged prehistoric or historic sites, known shipwrecks, and possible shipwreck sites during offshore operations.  A final scientific/technical manuscript/report will be required to be delivered. The period of performance of the resultant contract will be twenty (20) months with a cost range of $115,000 to $125,000. A scientific paper for publication in a refereed journal, as well as presentation of the study results at a scientific conference are required. In order to compete for this contract, an offeror must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, not later than COB May 29, 2002, a Capabilities Statement describing in detail:(A)The scientific personnel who would be responsible for the collection, interpretation and synthesis of information; (B) The organization's expertise with this type of work and a description of your facilities and resources; and (C) Specific references (including project identifier and description, period of performance, dollar amount, and client name and phone number) for previous work of this nature that your organization or personnel are currently performing or have completed within the last three (3) years.

<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior intends to competitively award a contract to a small business. PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CARFULLY. This requirement is set aside 100% to small businesses. In order to compete for this requirement your company must qualify under NAICS code 541990 All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services ($5.0M). PROJECT DESCRIPTION: In order to assess the potential environmental impacts of oil and gas leasing in offshore areas and the effects of new rules and regulations for offshore operations, MMS analysts forecast offshore oil and gas activities. MMS analysts currently predict offshore activities by a method that relies on "E and D" (exploration and development) base case scenarios. While the scenario method has merit, the present contract work will improve the data and methods: (1) More details are needed in variables that link activities to environmental impacts. For instance, the forecast of numbers of wells drilled is more useful if it separates deep wells and shallow wells, as the footage drilled relates to the amount of waste generated. (2)Policy analysis typically requires making a large number of base case and alternative forecasts to illustrate the effects of different policies, plus sensitivity cases using different market assumptions. To support policy analysis better, more variables and different sorts of equations are needed. To make these improvements, this requirement will create a new computer model. The new model will be used at MMS for making long-term annual activity projections for the western and central Gulf of Mexico areas. The work will address the needs for a formal equation structure and for additional variables. The new model will be used to make projections for environmental impact statements and similar documents. The model will also be used for projecting impacts of incentives (such as royalty relief) and for other policy analysis. Tasks required for building this model include the following. (1)Reviewing existing models, including but not limited to the MMS Exploration and Development scenarios; (2)Testing variables that might determine or relate to exploration, development, and production activity in the Gulf of Mexico; (3)Obtaining data from MMS and other public sources;(4)Investigating possible equations by theory and statistical analysis of the data;(5)Implementing the model in computer worksheets or in a stand-alone program in C++ or similar language;(6)Writing a user manual;(7)Completing the work within 14 months from date of contract. The work will involve meeting with MMS staff in Herndon and in New Orleans. INTRODUCTION: This will be a firm fixed price contract. The period of performance shall be no more than 14 months from the effective date of the contract. The estimated cost range is between $140,000 and $180,000. HOW TO RESPOND: In order to compete for this contract interested parties MUST demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, BY 4:00 PM EST, May 20, 2002, an original and four (4) copies of a Capabilities Statement detailing: A. Scientific and Technical Personnel For personnel responsible for collecting and interpreting information and for designing and building the new model, state: (1) Expertise in: industry and land economics; economic forecasting; building multiple-equation forecasting models; oil and gas supply modeling. (2)Your Expertise in: data management, computer programming, and writing and editing user manuals. Offeror shall provide specific reference (including project identifier and description, period of performance, dollar amount, and client name and phone number) for previous work of this nature that your organization or personnel is currently performing or has completed within the last five (5) years. References will be checked. Qualifications of any subcontractors or consultants will also be considered in these respects. B. Past Performance (1)Ability to complete projects on time, adhere to schedules and budgets, control costs, and make products of high quality. (2)Whether past projects worked on are comparable to this contract project (3)How well you as an organization and the key persons who will work on this project cooperated with past clients. C. Evaluation of Capability Statement . Your capabilities statement will be evaluated on the basis of experience and expertise of each of the key personnel, including those responsible for understanding MMS information needs, designing the model, data collection, computer programming, and preparing the user manual. Evaluation factors include: the length and quality of experience of persons pertinent to tasks they are assigned to; and the level and quality of education, as well as honors and recognition for work done in pertinent fields. We will also evaluate (1)The capability of the overall project manager to lead studies like this one, keep projects on schedule, and control costs; (2)The ability of the person responsible for data management to maintain working agreements with data sources like MMS; (3)The ability of persons responsible for preparing reports to create user-friendly, well-written, and well-designed manuals. Please send the original and four (4) copies to Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA 20170-4817, Attn: Anna M. DeGurse. Questions regarding this procurement should be faxed or emailed as soon as possible to 703-787-1387 or anna.degurse@mms.gov.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute, Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology(LCMB), proposes to enter into a sole source contract with Amersham Biosciences, 800 Centennial Avenue, Piscataway, NJ 08854, for a AKTA FPLC Frac 950 high performance liquid chromatography system with a Unicorn EVO 1.7 Ghz control unit.  The Laboratory  of Cellular and Molecular Biology requires a purification system to isolate active proteins from complex starting materials using affinity, gel filtration, ion exchange and hydrophobic interactions chromatography.  Many columns required to perform the chromatographic techniques that are within the LCM can only be used with a low pressure system that has the ability to make constant buffer gradients, maintain a steady flow rate upon increasing back pressure and perform in-line measurement of both UV absorbency and conductivity.  The LCMB has developed multiple purification methods using a current FPLC system that is compatible with current purification methods and columns.  In order to maintain current research development the LCMB requires a second FPLC low-pressure purification system that is compatible with current purification methods and columns.  Amersham Biosciences is the only source known to the Government that can provide the above items with the required features.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the Governments requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office no later than 1:30 PM EST on May 10, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The requirement will be procured as a commercial item in accordance with FAR 12.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  NAICS Code: 334513, business size standard is 500.  No collects calls will be accepted.

The USGS has been collecting data and studying surface-water sources (lakes and streams) in North Carolina since the late 1800's. There are 17 major rivers in the state of North Carolina and the USGS has collected data at thousands of surface-water sites in these major river basins. The number of these sites continues to increase as new locations are added to the N.C. District's ongoing data-collection operations and hydrologic investigations. 

When computer-card readers were in use, the North Carolina District systematically documented site characteristics on computer punch cards for all currently operated and pre-existing USGS surface-water sites in the State. Since that time, the practice of establishing and documenting site characteristics on computer punch cards (via typed or hand-written comments) for each new lake or stream site has continued. This process of establishing each new site has consisted of identifying the site's location on a map, and subsequently using the map to delineate the drainage area (DA) and determining the site's latitude and longitude (lat/long) location along with other characteristics (e.g., location, county, site type, period of record, etc.). Once all of the site characteristics have been determined, each site is assigned a unique "station" number that is used by the USGS to identify and track all records pertaining to that particular site. After determining site characteristics and assigning a station number, all of this information is recorded on a single computer punch card for each individual surface-water site studied by the USGS in North Carolina. These cards are arranged by river basin and stored in a single filing cabinet in the N.C. District Office.

The continuing practice of establishing new sites and documenting their characteristics on computer punch cards has resulted in the generation of approximately 16,000 cards. Originally, information that listed the characteristics about a given site had been typed or hand-written on the front and/or back of each computer card. Over the years, hand-written revisions to some of the original site characteristics have been made. These revisions have often been written in random locationson many of the cards.

At present, there is no complete, readily accessible computer database that lists all surface-water sites that have been studied by the USGS in North Carolina. Hence, there is no complete electronic database that includes all of the site characteristics that have been documented by the USGS. Likewise, there is no efficient means available to track historical revisions that have been made to the site characteristics over time. In addition, these computer cards and the information documented on them are extremely vulnerable to loss, damage, or misplacement. The site numbers, drainage areas, and other information recorded on the cards represent decades of detailed and specialized work that could not be reproduced if lost. The establishment of a computer database that lists all surface-water sites and includes all of the site characteristics documented on the computer punch cards, including revisions, is needed so that information can be easily retrieved, maintained, and added in the future. 

In 1997, a station-card data entry pilot project was completed and a computer database was generated for all surface-water sites within the Neuse River Basin in North Carolina. Using an established format, site characteristics listed on approximately 1,800 computer punch cards for sites within the Neuse River basin were entered into a database. The database generated by the pilot project consists of an ASCII file containing all of the information found on 1,800 individual cards. This database was developed without any specialized software and without any specialized computer language. The structure of this format was designed as a "catch-all" to cover all possible site information that may be written or typed on any given card. A description of the established format follows on the next page.
 

Computer Card Entry Line-by-Line Field Descriptions:

General Rules: 1. Typed and/or hand-written entries may be entered on front and/or back of cards and the      same information will not be consistently found in the same place on different cards.
 2. Revisions for station number, name, lat/long, and drainage area should be typed inside 
brackets with no intervening spaces at the appropriate location. 
 3. The word "County" does not have to be entered in the county (#11) field.
 4. Few, if any, cards will have information to enter for all of the fields.

Although all surface water sites and associated characteristics have been entered into a database for sites within the Neuse River basin, information documented on punch cards for sites within the 16 remaining major river basins (or approximately 14,200 cards) has not been entered. The North Carolina USGS District office does not have the necessary workspace, equipment, or resources available to enter this information into a database. With the need to have information from the other 16 river basins readily accessible, it was thought best to obtain a contract for card data entry from an outside source.

Since the computer punch cards contain original data that cannot be reproduced, they are too valuable to be mailed or shipped offsite. To reduce the potential for loss of the cards, any firm that is awarded a contract to complete the card data entry must be local, where cards can be hand-delivered. Local is defined as being located within 20 miles of the North Carolina USGS Raleigh District Office. Since there are many abbreviations and other terms on the cards that are meaningful only to people familiar with hydrologic principles, some explanation and training will be needed to make the potential contract firm aware of the nature of the information found on each card. 



ARTICLE II Statement of Work

The card data-entry contract requires creating a database that includes all of the information that has been typed and/or hand-written on approximately 14,200 computer punch cards. The work will be performed offsite and cards will be hand-delivered to the contracting firm. The contracting firm must be local. Local is defined as being located within 20 miles of the USGS Raleigh North Carolina District Office. Due to the irreplaceable nature of the information on them, the cards will be hand-delivered in groups of 200-500 cards. As the vendor completes data-entry for one group of cards, the next group of cards will be delivered and the previous group returned to USGS. The USGS reserves the right to retrieve the cards from the vendor at any given time should the need arise. To the extent possible, the resulting database must be consistent with the pre-existing database created when the Neuse River site cards were entered. 

The contracting firm is required to create a database that would be in (or could easily be converted to) an ASCII format. This database will contain all typed or hand-written information listed on approximately 14,200 punch cards. Information will be included from the front and back of each card. Not all cards will have information listed on both sides, however, most will. All information on the cards can be read by sight. No mechanized card reader will be necessary to obtain information from the cards. The database may be created directly in an ASCII format without the requirement of any specialized software. Creation of the database using Microsoft-based software, such as ACCESS or EXCEL, will be permitted provided that it can easily be converted to an ASCII format. The fields (listed in the example above) used to develop the Neuse River card database will be followed as a template for entering information from the punch cards for all sites within the remaining 16 river basins. The maximum number of fields that may be typed or hand-written on the cards is shown in the example shown on the preceding page. The maximum number of characters possible for each given field is not defined. All data entries must be double-keyed or otherwise 100% quality assured and verified by the contracting firm to eliminate data entry mistakes and other errors. Producing scanned images of the front and back of each card to accompany the corresponding card data will also be required. Each card is a standard IBM-type computer card that measures 7.25 inches long and 3.125 inches tall. Most of the cards are manila colored, however, cards of other pastel colors will be encountered. Scanned images may be in color or in black and white; color images will be preferred. 



ARTICLE III Deliverables

Upon completion of data entry for each group of cards delivered, a sample of the database will be provided to the USGS for review. The resulting database will be delivered to the USGS on CD or other common computer format.


ARTICLE IV Period of Performance

The work will begin on the date of the award and must be completed by September 30, 2002. Due to the availability of funds, the period of performance can be extended to September 30, 2003.

ARTICLE V Government Furnished Materials

Approximately 14,200-computer punch cards will be delivered in groups of 200-500 cards. Since the computer punch cards contain original data that cannot be reproduced, they are too valuable to be mailed or shipped offsite. To reduce the potential for loss of the cards, any firm that is awarded a contract to complete the card data entry must be local, where cards can be hand-delivered. USGS reserves the right to retrieve all punch cards at any time if needed.


ARTICLE VI Contracting Officer's Representative (COR)

	A.	The performance required herein shall be subject to the technical direction of the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).  As used herein, "technical direction" is defined as direction to the contractor that fills in details, suggests possible lines of approach, or otherwise supplements the scope of the work set forth herein and will not constitute a new assignment, and does not supersede or modify an article or clause of this contract.


ARTICLE VII Invoice and Payment

Invoices can be mailed monthly to U.S. Geological Survey, Water Resources, 3916 Sunset Ridge Road, Raleigh, NC  27607, Attn: Administrative Officer.  Invoice will be approved by COR and then processed for payment.

Description
This project calls for various repairs and/or complete reconstruction to base streets at Dyess AFB, Texas.  The project is a requirements type contract and work will be released to contractor in work packages via individual task orders.   The government reserves the right to utilize in-house forces to accomplish work on base pavements; however, the government guarantees that all task orders for work on this contract will be awarded to the contractor, except for those instances where government in-house forces are used.  In-house work forces are defined as government employees only.   Unit prices will be taken for the Base Year (year one) and one Option Year (year two).  Work may include, but is not necessarily limited to:  1) Portland cement concrete and hot mix asphaltic concrete pavement section replacement, 2) installation of asphalt overlays, 3) installation of pavement markings, 4) sidewalks, 5) curbs and gutters, and 6) surveying.  The North American Industry Classification Code that applies to the principal nature of the acquisition is 234110.  The successful contractor will be selected using Past Performance Trade Off (PPTO) procedures, resulting in the Best Value to the Government.  Past performance is significantly greater in importance than price.  The solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 22 May 2002 via the Federal Business Opportunities web page at http://eps.gov/.  The site visit is scheduled for 5 June 2002 at 9:00 AM CDT.    Once the solicitation is posted it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this website frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  It is anticipated that the following viewers will be needed to view the solicitation: Microsoft Word (.doc), Adobe Acrobat Reader (.pdf), WinZip (.zip or .exe.), and/or MaxView/SourceView (.svd).  More information concerning these viewers can be found on the EPS website.  Any prospective contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.

<DESC>Professional land surveying services for the monumentation and posting of Colville National Forest Boundaries. 

The project name is the Leona Fire Cadastral Survey and is located on the Republic Ranger District, Colville National Forest, Ferry County, Washington.  The project location is T. 38 & 39 N., R. 34 E., W.M., which is approximately north east of Republic, Washington.

The project consists of up to 1 records research, 12 each corner searches, 6 miles of control survey, 15 each corner monumentation, 6 miles of marking and posting, 1 job of records and reports and 38 each maintenance of existing corners.  Estimated contract time is 120 calendar days with an estimated start work date of June 24, 2002.  

Interested and qualified firms are invited to respond by submitting one copy of forms SF-254, SF-255 and supplementary narrative and samples as follows: (a) Provide a brief description of steps you will use to complete a project of this type, (b) Describe your corner search process; (c) What measurement and observation techniques will be used to assure compliance with contract specifications?  (d) Some examples of land survey problems you have encountered on similar projects and how you resolved them;  (e) How will corner monumentation be accomplished?  (f) How will marking and posting be accomplished?  (g) How will control survey be accomplished?  (h) How will you accomplish the research needed?  (i) Name, registration number and percent of time, Professional Land Surveyor in charge of project will spend on each phase, and  (j) Submit a copy of a recent survey plat that is representative of your cadastral work.  

Selection of firms for negotiation shall be through an order of preference based on demonstrated competence and qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the type of professional services required that include:  (1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services;  (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction and the use of recovered materials;  (3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time;  (4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules;  (5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified, given the nature and size of the project; and  (6) Additional points may be assigned or credit given to potential contractors that are or will subcontract with a Small Business Administration certified 8(a) contractor or other small disadvantaged businesses. This project is somewhat unique in that numerous corner searches are being asked for without the benefit of dependent resurvey.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), intends to procure fellowship training from Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Stanford Sloan Program, Room 400 Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305-5015.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 611310 and the business size standard is $5M.  A mid-level professional staff member of the NINDS recently applied and was accepted into the Stanford University Sloan Fellowship Program, a prestigious general management program that is designed to broaden and develop outstanding mid-career executives from the United States and international business, government, and non-profit organizations for general and senior management positions.  This programs features include four critical areas of trends and issues: 1) encourage a broader perspective that will make the participant a more effective manager and encourage a pattern of lifelong learning and personal growth; 2) develop a deeper understanding of fundamental management concepts, both through functional approaches such as accounting, finance, marketing, strategic thinking, and quantitative methods of decision analysis, and in cross-disciplinary work that encourages new approaches to business issues; 3) explore the increasingly global nature of the economic, social, political, legal and ethical responsibilities of management; and 4) expand abilities in group and interpersonal relationships through both peer group interaction and academic work in organizational behavior, human resource management, leadership, and related fields.  The program enables specialized thesis study as well.  In addition to the above features and the selectivity of the program (only 48 fellows per year are accepted and admitted to the program), this fellowship is unique in that an MBA or Master of Science in Management degree from Stanford is earned in only 10 months, and the program includes a very integrated curriculum that is different from other degree programs.  Core requirements and electives are taken in conjunction with seminars and mandatory field trips (i.e. to organizations and establishments in New York, Washington DC and other major cities), and much of the learning is through mutual groups.  Furthermore, the program totally removes the employee from his or her workplace since relocation to Stanford, California is required.  For the above reasons, this fellowship program is believed to be unique.  This is not a request for competitive quotation, however, if any interested party believes it has an established fellowship program with the above attributes, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  Information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NINDS to determine if the party can meet the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracts Office by 1:00 PM EST (local Washington, DC time) on May 8, 2002.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Malinda Holdcraft Purchasing Agent at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) is attached.  The cost arrangement for the production options are still under consideration.  The JSAM strategy for Oral Presentation wis under consideration.  The DRFP will be updated in these areas at a later date.  All comments and questions should be in writing and e-mailed to the POC.  

In the San Antonio RFP and Acquisition Highway (SARAH) Notice to Offerors dated 9 May 01, all potential offerors were requested to submit the following items by the listed deadlines in order to be a potential offeror for the SDD/Production contract:

Funding documentation to support their prorata share of Government Testing - 30 Jun 01
System Design Information (Conceptual Drawings) - 30 Sept 01
14 Test Samples each Material - 31 Oct 01
25 Prototypes - 30 Jan 02

.

During SDD, the successful JSAM contractor will translate their design approach into a stable, interoperable, producible, supportable, and cost-effective design; validate the affordability and producibility of the system, prove the production processes; and demonstrate system performance to specifications through testing.  During this phase the following activities will occur: Developmental Test &Evaluation (DT&E), man-rating, safe-to-fly certification, Operational Testing &Evaluation (OT&E), technical data development, provisioning of spare parts, Functional Configuration Audit (FCA), Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) and Production Readiness Review.  The Government will base its decision to enter production on the results of DT&E, OT&E, production readiness, and system affordability.  We anticipate a single award for the SDD/Production effort; production would be an option on the SDD contract.  Cost As an Independent Variable (CAIV) principles will be used to meet technical requirements at a price the user is willing to pay.  A small business set-aside is not considered appropriate for this program effort.    Teaming or partnering within industry allows for the most promising technical design and expertise.  Please indicate how teaming or partnering will be considered in your approach.  The SDD contract will feature cost-reimbursement contract type with a cost-plus award fee (CPAF) pricing arrangement.  Production is anticipated to be Firm Fixed Price options.

<DESC>This procurement is for one solicitation resulting in the award of up to five Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction Contracts to the responsible proposers whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, cost or price and other factors considered.  The Government reserves the right to award fewer than five contracts if sufficient number of acceptable proposals are not submitted to make more awards.  The work will consist of HVAC and mechanical with associated electrical work and incidental related work at Marine Corps Base, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, Marine Corps Air Station, New River, Jacksonville, North Carolina and Other Military Installations/Sites in North Carolina.  Projects assigned to the IDIQ contracts will use the Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) approach to scope and price the work.  After award of the initial contract(s), awardees, will compete for task orders based on best value, low price or low price technically acceptable to the Government.  The task order is written based on a Government/Contractor Team cooperative scoping of work.  The work will be demolition, repair, replacement, extension and modification of HVAC/Mechanical systems, steam and condensate lines, minor boiler repair, plumbing, piping, motors, controls, and incidental related work, including, but not limited to, painting, asbestos/lead paint abatement, architectural modifications, and related electrical work.  Each contract will be for one base year with three one-year options.  The total 4-year (base year and three option years) not-to-exceed amount for each contract is not to exceed $40,000,000.00 maximum per contractor.  Each contract has an annual value not to exceed of $10,000,000.00 maximum per contractor.  Construction schedules will be determined for each project at the issuance of each task order.  The five best value contractors will be selected for the award of either the seed project or the award of one of the four contracts with a minimum guarantee of $50,000.00 to each successful offeror over the full term of the contract to include option years.  The first IDIQ construction contract of the five will be awarded with a firm fixed price, 100% design as the seed project.  This is a RFP, which requires submission of technical and price proposals.  Evaluation for award will be based on technical factors including (A) Past Performance, (B) Management and Organization, and (C) Support for Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women Owned Businesses.  Management and Organization has subfactors which are:  (1) Corporate Experience, (2) Quality Control and Key Personnel, (3) Safety and Health and (4) Bonding Capability (i.e. Provide Bonding Capability for projects of size and nature envisioned in an amount of no less than $10,000,000.00 on surety?s letterhead.  Bonding capability shall be accompanied by a document authenticating the agent?s authority to sign bonds for the surety company pursuant to FAC5252.228-9305 in Section I).  Safety and Health has subfactors (a) Experience Modification Rating, (b) OSHA Lost Work Day Rate, (c) OSHA Recordable Incidents Rate and (d) Federal, State, and Municipal OSHA Citations.  Support for Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women Owned Businesses has subfactors for (1) Small Business Past Performance and (2) Subcontracting Plan Effort.  It will also be based on pricing full plans and specifications for the seed project, N62470-02-R-3357, Major Interior Repairs, BEQ?s G541 and G542 at Marine Corps Air Station, New River, Jacksonville, North Carolina, which has an estimated cost range of $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00.  After initial award of the seed project, the selected Contractor(s) will be required to participate with the Government in an on-site scoping meeting for any upcoming projects.  After determination of up to five Offerors who offers the best value to the Government, the lowest price Offeror will be awarded the seed project.  All five Contractors will compete on subsequent task orders.  These subsequent projects will be non-complex performance oriented tasks requiring minimal design.  They will be scoped by the Government/Contractor team and may not have traditional plans and specifications but may include sketches and requests for catalog cuts and other submittals.  The salient requirements of the task orders will be scoped by the Government/Contractor team in order to develop a mutually agreed upon Statement of Work (SOW).  Award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order; however, pricing will be weighted heavily.  The awarded task order will be a performance scoped, firm fixed price task with a specific completion date.  Should the second, third, fourth or fifth IDIQ Contractor be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award considerations may be modified in order to ensure each participating Contractor is awarded task orders meeting the minimum guarantee over the full term of the contract to include option years.   All initial awarded Contractors will be required to participate in all MACC walk-throughs and submit proposals.  Failure to participate responsibly in walk-throughs and failure to submit proposals may result in the Contractor forfeiting its minimum guarantee, the Government not soliciting the Contractor proposals for future task orders or exercising the option to extend the contract for an additional year.  The contract will be awarded to the best value offeror in accordance with the requirements of FAR Part 15.  Only the five selected Contractors will be permitted to propose on the task orders.  Proposals from another Contractor will not be accepted.  A minimum of two proposals will satisfy the competitive requirements of MACC and preclude the necessity of soliciting for a replacement contractor if for any reason one of the contracts is terminated or one of the proposers is not able to participate in the process.  Proposed contract is unrestricted with a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 235110 and Size Standard of $12.0 Million.  No public bid opening will be held.  A subcontracting plan is required, if the contract is awarded to a Large Business and Small Businesses are required to submit the information outlined in Section L.  Plans and specs will be available on or about 16 May 2002.  The estimated date for receipt of offers is on or about 17 June 2002.  This solicitation is available in electronic format only.  Official access to the solicitation is via the Internet at the NAVFAC E-Solicitations (ESOL) website:  http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil and may be downloaded free of charge.

<DESC>NA Due to size limitations, the complete Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) cannot be posted here.  Please visit the Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP) for the complete document.  The URL for the IBOP is https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.  The BAA can b e found by accessing the Army Contracting Activity drop down menu, selecting CECOM and then searching for DAAB15-02-R-0030. PART I - DESCRIPTION:  This document is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) sponsored by the U. S. Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Night Vision Electronics Sensors Directorate (NVESD).  This BAA is issued under provisions of paragraph 6.102(d )(2) and paragraph 35.016 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for competitive selection of research and development proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  Accordingly, proposals selected for award are considered to be  the result of full and open competition and fully compliant with PL 98-369, 'The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984'.  This BAA will be posted on the Interagency Business Opportunities Page at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.  Any amendments to this BA A will only be posted at the IBOP.  It is recommended that all interested parties register for the solicitation specific mailing list that will provide email notification of any updates to the BAA.  Prospective offerors should note that this BAA is an expr ession of interest only and does not commit the Government to make an award or pay proposal preparation costs generated in response to this announcement.  The cost of proposal preparation for response to a BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge t o any resultant contract or any other contract.  However, it may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  This BAA is intended for the development of research efforts in support of the NVESD - Counte rmine Division.  Specific information on program goals is provided in the following section, Program Description.  Potential offerors are reminded that only a duly warranted contracting officer may obligate the government to an agreement involving the expe nditure of Government funds.  Questions concerning contractual, cost or pricing, or proposal format matters may be directed to the Ms. Ellen Morris, Contract Specialist, 703-325-6152 or email: ellen.morris@cacw.army.mil.    Questions concerning technical i ssues may be directed to the attention of Mr. Tom Becker, NVESD, at tom.becker@nvl.army.mil with a carbon copy to the Contract Specialist.  No discussion is to be held with offerors by the technical staff after White Paper and/or Proposal submission withou t the permission of the Contracting Officer.  In order for any proposals to be considered, the proposed effort MUST meet the definition of basic or applied research and development found at FAR 35.001.  Submission of White Papers is mandatory prior to subm ission of a full proposal.  The selection of one or more proposals for award will be based on a peer and scientific evaluation of each offerors response (to include both technical and cost aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response  to this announcement.  Pursuant to the requirements of FAR 52.219-9, if the total amount of the proposal exceeds $500,000, a large business offeror(s) selected for award will be required at that time to submit a Subcontracting Plan for Small, Small Disadv antaged and Woman Owned Small Business Concerns.  PART II - PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  The NVESD Countermine Division is searching for technology approaches capable of detecting anti-personnel (AP) and anti-tank (AT) mines, at a minimum distance of 10m (measure d horizontally) in front of the detection sensor. The threshold is 10m standoff from the operator and the goal is 10m standoff from the sensor.  Size and weight constraints are for the sensor suite to be the payload for an autonomous robotic platform (thre shold) or soldier borne (goal).   The objective of this BAA is to solicit an expression of interest from industry and organizations through White Papers that describe a technological approach that has the potential to meet the performance capabilities defined above for the AMDS mission.  Based on the evaluation of the White Papers, the Army will select up to 8 technologies mature enough for a demonstration, most probably at Ft. AP Hill, Virginia, in late Fiscal Year (FY) 2002.  The Government does not intend to purchase the demonstrators during this phase; it will however, pay selected sources cost for round trip transportation of the demonstrator and labor and per-diem cost for operation of the demonstrator not to exceed a total of $25,000.  The purpose of the demonstrations is to exhibit  that the technology has the potential, starting in FY2005, to be integrated into a robotic vehicular platform and be ready for operational demonstrations by FY2007.   Based on the results of this demonstration, full proposals will be requested for multi-y ear technology development contracts from those companies whose proposed technologies successfully meet the stated performance criteria.  The Army anticipates awarding up to 6 multi-year technology development contracts before the end of FY2003.  The goals  for each development contract will be to mature the detection technology so that it is capable of detecting surface-laid and buried anti-personnel (AP) and anti-tank (AT) land mines at to meet the following exit performance critieria:  Probability of Dete ction (Pd): current:   95%, minimum: 98%; and goal: 99%-- False Alarm Rate (FAR): current: ~ 0.3/meter squared; minimum:  0.2/meter squared; goal:  0.03/meter squared -- Stand-Off Potential:  current:   ~ 1 meter;  minimum:  10(stand-off from operator);  g oal:  10(stand-off from sensor) -- Coverage Rate:  current:  ~ 1 meter squared per minute; minimum:  2 meter squared per minute; goal:  50 meter squared per minute -- Unit cost:  Minimum:  $15,000/production unit; Goal:  10,000/production unit.  The weight  goals for the detection sensor are defined as capable of being man-portable.  While it is currently TRADOCs intention to select an autonomous robotic vehicle in FY05 for use in a prototype demonstration, the platform decision could still be a soldier.  At  the completion of the technology development phase, the Army intends to award up to two-system development contracts in late FY05 for the design and integration of a pre-production prototype detection sensor package into an autonomous platform for an oper ational demonstration in FY07.  Operational prototype demonstrations will be conducted at Ft. AP Hill, Yuma Test Center, and Aberdeen Proving Grounds.  These contracts will be awarded under the auspices of the rules and regulations for Other Than Full and Open Competition.  This BAA constitutes the only announcement that will be made seeking participants for the AMDS STO.  Companies or organizations that do not participate in the FY2002 technology demonstration may not be considered later for participation in the technology development or the system development phases of the AMDS STO.  Sensors developed under this program may be incorporated into other Army countermine development programs or programs, such as the HSTAMIDS program managed by the Program Mana ger for Mines, Countermine and Demolitions (PM-MCD) as P3I.  Awards against this BAA can be made for two yeas after receipt of proposals.  Specific costs and terms and conditions will be negotiated prior to award.  The Government contemplates the awarding of Cost Reimbursement (Cost, CPFF) type contract (s); however, proposals based on other contract types will be considered.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the white papers and proposals received.  The maximum le ngth of an award will be three years.  There is no 'a priori judgement' regarding the number or size of individual awards or the allocation of total research an d development funds across the technology solutions listed above.   PART III - WHITE PAPER SUBMITTAL:  White Paper Content:  In order to be evaluated for participation in the demonstration to take place at Fort AP Hill in early FY03, vendors are required t o submit a white paper describing the technical capabilities of the proposed technology and the estimated cost for attendance of the demonstration.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort and expense by potential offerors in prepa ring a full technical and cost proposal for efforts not considered responsive or for efforts evaluated to have very low overall probability of obtaining support.  White Papers shall consist of two primary sections, Technical and Cost.  The technical sectio n shall be no more that 30 pages.  The Technical section shall consist of a clear description of the technology(s) being proposed, the objectives of the proposed effort, the technical issues to be resolved to accomplish the objectives, the approach to reso lving these issues, an assessment of the ultimate capability of the proposed technology.  The cost section shall consist of a one page cost breakdown of the actual cost of conducting a demonstration at Ft. AP Hill, Virginia, and in no cases shall be greate r than $25,000.  In addition to the above information, the white paper submission shall include the Non-Disclosure agreement required under paragraph 'Use of Contractor Evaluators'.  Evaluation Processes:  CECOM-Acquisition Center-Washington will respond t o each white paper with an invitation to propose or a notification that a proposal will not be entertained.  Only those invited offerors will be permitted to submit a full proposal.  White Papers will be evaluated as they are received, however, they may be  collected for periodic evaluation.   White Papers lacking scientific merit or relevance to Army needs, or those that may fall in areas wherein funds are not expected to be available may be rejected without further action.  Use of Contractor Evaluators:  T he Army has determined that it will be necessary to use the services of Institute for Defense Analysis (IDA) in a white paper/proposal evaluator role. The Army contracts with IDA and its employment contracts with its personnel prohibit the unauthorized dis closure of data to which IDA or its employees have access under this Broad Agency Announcement.  The firm is expressly prohibited from competing on the subject acquisition.  The exclusive responsibility for source selection remains with the Government. In accomplishing the duties related to the evaluation process, IDA may require access to proprietary information contained in the offerors' proposals.  Therefore, pursuant to FAR 9.505-4, IDA must execute an agreement with each offeror that states that they w ill (1) protect the offerors' information from unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it remains proprietary and (2) refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished.  It is requested that each offeror co ntact IDA to effect execution of such agreement as soon as possible to enable the completion of the evaluation of the white papers.  Each offeror shall submit a copy of the agreement with the White Paper submission (see Part III).  Contact information for IDA is provided below:  Institute for Defense Analysis, Attn: Harold Bertrand, 4850 Mark Center Drive, Alexandria, VA 22311-1882, hbertran@ida.org.

<DESC>The United States Department of Education has a requirement for a large, complex data collection.  The National Study of Faculty and Students [NSoFaS] is designed to collect  information on nationally representative samples of faculty, instructional staff and students. The study consists of two main components. The faculty and instructional staff component [Part A-NSoPF:2004] will be similar in scope to prior National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF) data collections.  The student survey component [Part B-NPSaS:2004], will be similar to prior National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) data collections, plus include state-representative samples of students enrolled at public 2-year, public 4-year, and private not-for-profit 4-year in 12 states. Data will be collected primarily via the web and include self-administered, telephone interview and web field work.  Although different modes of collection are anticipated, the system will be web-based. This study will result in documented data files, electronic codebooks, data analysis systems, and tabulations/descriptive reports for each main component.
 
The faculty and instructional staff component [Part A or NSoPF] will consist of a field test in 2002-03 and a full-scale sample in 2003-04. Data will be collected from a nationally representative sample of faculty and instructional staff in 2- and 4-year (and above) public and private, not-for-profit colleges and universities that are Title IV eligible, degree-granting institutions in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.  If additional funding becomes available, faculty and institutions in the private for-profit 4-year sector will be added to Part A.  

The student component [Part B or NPSaS] will consist of a field test in 2002-03 and a full-scale sample in 2003-04. NPSaS is a comprehensive nationwide study of how students and their families pay for postsecondary education.  It includes nationally representative samples of undergraduates, graduates, and first-professional students; students attending less-than-2-year institutions, community colleges, 4-year colleges, and major universities. For 2004, the sample will also include state-representative undergraduate student samples enrolled in public 2-year, public 4-year, and private not-for-profit 4-year institutions in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, Oregon,Tennessee, and Texas. Students who receive financial aid and those who do not receive aid participate in NPSaS.  Results of the study are used to help determine federal policy regarding student financial aid.

<DESC>INTEGRATED LIBRARY SYSTEM (ILS). The Library at the National Gallery of Art, a national resource for art research with a growing collection of over 200,000 volumes, 2,400 serials, 180,000 slides, and 2.5 million photographs, seeks to replace its existing library system with a modern, commercial library system. The ILS will manage the Library's core operations in technical services (acquisitions and fund accounting, cataloging and authority control, serials control, and physical processing), reader services (online public catalog, interlibrary loan, and circulation and inventory), and digital resource management.  This fully integrated system must support a wide variety of library functions, including some that may be unique to the NGA library, and allow staff and researchers to locate and manage information from internal (art collection management and financial management) and external digital resources, regardless of format, through a single interface.  The ILS must be able to import and export needed data in the internal systems without corruption or loss.  Three databases (main library catalog, slide library, and photo archives) reside on the existing VTLS Classic which the contractor must migrate to the new ILS.  Software must be commercially available and configurable for the Gallery's needs.  The contractor must provide the commercial ILS, engineering analysis, system design and security, configuration and customization, data migration, initial training, acceptance testing, in addition to software maintenance and support extending over a period of 12 months with options to extend software maintenance and support for a maximum of 48 months.  The goal is to have a fully operational system no later than the fall of 2002.  Offerors must demonstrate experience in providing ILS for libraries of the size and complexity stated above that have at least 50 full-time staff and one hundred concurrent users.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered.

<DESC>Description:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemental with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation number is RFQ-R8-02-13.  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-17.  The applicable North American Industry Classification is 325320; size standard is 500 employees.  The USDA-Forest Service is soliciting for the acquisition of the following herbicides/pesticides:  Item no. (1a) Glyphosate 4#/gal (no surfactant) 2.5 gallon containers (2 per box) 1160 gallons OR Item no.

(2) Velpar L (product specific; no substitutions) 1250 gallons (2.5 gallon container, 2 per box). Item no. (3) Arsenal Applicators Concentrate (Forestry 4 lb ai, (product specific; no substitutions)) 50 gallons (1 quart container; 4 per box).  Item no.

Products 2-6 are product and packaging size specific; products are specific to meet Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) labeling requirements, and package sizes are specific to meet desired storage and use safety standards.  While other products or packaging is available they are unacceptable due to either regulatory or safety constraints.  Products 1a and 1b are equivalent products, calculations reflecting the fact that different formulators package at different rates of active ingredient per gallon.  Either rate per gallon is acceptable if tendered product is labeled for forestry use and the formulation contains no surfactant.  Packaging other than 2 per box is acceptable but 2.5 gallon/container is the maximum volume container acceptable.  Proposed wording for the bid would be Glyphosate as a solution in water without surfactant ? 4640 lbs ai as either 1160 gals of a 4lb ai / gal formulation or 860 gallons of a 5.4 lb ai/gal formulation (2.5 gal containers, 2 per box); must be labeled for forestry use.  Quoters may submit a bid on item 1a, lb or lc.  (Two listings are given to allow purchase of existing4# ai/gal stock but then move to the newer 5.4# ai/gal products).  Product specific EPA requires that products be labeled for site of application.  Any product purchased from this contract must have appropriate labeling to permit forest, right-of-way, or wildlife site use.  Quoters must provide products meeting this label constraints or product will be returned at quoters expense.  All quantities are estimated.

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services, on a fixed price basis, from the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, of Texas A&M University.  The National Marine Mammals Laboratory is continuing studies to quantify the amount of genetic differentiation among populations or subspecies of Steller sea lions.  This research will facilitate management of  this endangered species.   The Government intends to negotiate solely with Texas A&M because this is a follow-on to work that the university has been performing, and because that institution has the unique ability to utilize Polymerase Chain Reactions techniques on marine mammals.  Only Texas A&M has developed unique primers that cut the genetic material at specific locations.  Any interested concern which believes it can provide these services should send a qualifying statement to the above address by 15 May 2002.  The period of performance is expected to be one year, with options for two additional years.  This is not a request for a competitive proposal.  This notice will be the only official notice of such solicitation.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Special Programs Administration, Office of Contracts and Procurement, DMA-30, 400 7th Street, SW, Room 7104, Washington, DC 20590 has a requirement for contractor support in conducting the Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) tabletop/area exercises and security analytical support as described below. This requirement is 100% SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES with the capabilities to perform this requirement as set forth in this announcement. The Government and industry representatives created the National Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP) through a series of public workshops in 1994.  PREP was designed to establish a workable program of tabletop and area exercises to further the provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) that relates to spill response preparedness, while being economically feasible for the government and the oil industry.  To assist the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) in meeting its PREP responsibilities, contractor support is required, including technical support for up to twenty (20) tabletop exercises, up to four (4) area exercises and the submission of policy papers, security assessment reports and after action reports. Tabletop exercises are strategic exercises focusing on the operator's spill management team and their approach to implementing their Facility Response Plan (FRP).  Area exercises are designed to show that all of the agencies, which have a role in responding to spills, are adequately prepared to do so.  Area exercises are meant to test the response by government, industry, and community players as detailed in the local Area Contingency Plan (ACP).  With RSPA's emphasis on pipeline safety as an integral component of safety, RSPA intends to expand its exiting exercise program under PREP to include security issues in the scenarios by the use of security analytical support.   In performance of the security analytical support services, the contractor will identify courses of action for RSPA to take to expedite the return to service of damaged pipelines. The exercises will also require that the contractor submit the following deliverables:  (1) Policy papers, (2) Security Assessment Reports, (3) After Action Reports, (4) Exercise Schedules (Calendar), (5) Tabletop Player's Manual ( i.e., notebook for each participant that contains information such as exercise scenario, ground rules, feedback forms, blank pages and lessons learned), (6) Exercise Synopsis, (7) Exercise Reports, (8) Operator's Performance Reports, (9) Area Exercise Scenario's and (10) Lessons Learned Reports/Input.  The contractor will use audio-visual and computer technology to enhance the realism of the exercises. Contractor personnel must possess requisite technical qualifications to perform this requirement. All contract staff must possess a secret clearance or be able to qualify for a secret clearance. REMINDER:  This requirement is 100% SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.  The contract period of performance is anticipated to be one base year (twelve months) with the possibility of two (2) option years (twelve months each).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541690 and the small business size standard is $6 million.  It is anticipated that this procurement will be awarded as a Cost Plus Award Fee type contract.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered.  All requests for notification of solicitation availability must be submitted in writing to the following address:  U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration; Office of Contracts and Procurement, DMA-30; Attn:  Ms. Cynthia D. Barzey, Contracting Officer; 400 Seventh Street, SW, Room 7104; Washington, DC 20590.  Requests may also be submitted by email to the following email address: Cynthia.Barzey@rspa.dot.gov.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled COLD SHROUD, SOLICITATION NO. 8-1-1-S7-D6602 which was posted on APRIL 1, 2002. This amendment is to post answers to questions that were received from potential offerors: (1) QUESTION RECEIVED:  Do you really mean the cylinder is to be made from and extrusion We think the cylinder should be made from a roll-up using 3/16" plate. RESPONSE RECEIVED:  The roll-up 3/16 plate would be fine. (2) QUESTION RECEIVED:  The original specifications state the shroud shall be made in two sections each one 45" long. The drawing shows a one-piece construction. Which is correct? RESPONSE RECEIVED:  One-piece contruction would be best. (3)  QUESTION RECEIVED:  If there are two sections, then the coolant line must be broken. Are the coolant lines to the joined by 3-3/8" conflat flanges? There is not sufficient room to connect outside the shroud:  48" I.D. chamber less 42-3/8" O.D. shroud only leaves 2.8" on each side, The coolant lines are only 1" therefore, 2-1/8" conflats would be large enough to make the connection. OK? RESPONSE RECEIVED:  No two sections. (4)  QUESTION RECEIVED:  The changes indicate only the end plates are actively cooled.  Is this correct? RESPONSE RECEIVED:  The end plates (i.e. 42" diameter) and 90"  shroud body need to be actively cooled.  Not the cover plates that cover the hole openings on the shroud or end plates. (5)  QUESTION RECEIVED:  Is aluminum plate permitted with attached “D” tube in lieu of extrusion to form the cylinder shroud section as well as the ends of the shroud? The shroud drawing seems to show a plate for the cylinder section rather that a grouping of extrusions. RESPONSE RECEIVED:  We actually want “D” tubing attached to aluminum plate. In the order of 1+” OD, with ¾” ID. (6)  QUESTION RECEIVED:  What are the required heat loads for the shroud? RESPONSE RECEIVED:  TBD (7)  QUESTION RECEIVED:  What is the flow, its properties, and allowable pressure drop through the shroud? RESPONSE RECEIVED:  The cooling available is 1kW @ 20 degrees Kelvin, the flow is 21 grams/second. (8)  QUESTION RECEIVED:  What is the temperature uniformity requirement if any of the shroud? RESPONSE RECEIVED:  The refrigerator outlet temp is 10 degrees Kelvin with a return temperature of 15 degrees Kelvin. (9)  QUESTION RECEIVED:  What is the width of the extrusions specified if these extrusions are mandatory? RESPONSE RECEIVED:  The extrusions is not mandatory. (10)  QUESTION RECEIVED:  Is there a specification for the maximum temperature of the shroud between the cooling tubes? If so, what is that temperature? RESPONSE RECEIVED:  No. (11)  QUESTION RECEIVED:  How many cooling tubes are there on the shroud? Only the inlet and outlet are shown. RESPONSE RECEIVED:  Approximately 10 tubes at 36 degrees apart. The cooling path will need to mate to our existing inlet and outlet. They are 3 3/8" conflats. (12)  QUESTION RECEIVED:  What is the anticipated heat load on the shroud? How much of that load isto be associated with the shroud support? RESPONSE RECEIVED:  TBD (13)  QUESTION RECEIVED:  The source of cooling is a helium refrigerator. What is the anticipated coolant inlet?  Outlet temperature?  What is the flow?  the delta T or cooling available? RESPONSE RECEIVED:  The output of the refrigerator will 10 degrees Kelvin and return will be 15 degrees Kelvin. The cooling available is 1kW @ 20K.   (14)  QUESTION RECEIVED:  The original solicitation referred to a drawing of the shroud support points and cooling path.   The drawings I received had no information about the cooling paths. Is there to be another drawing showing the cooling path?  Is there a preferred spacing of the cooling tubes? RESPONSE RECEIVED:  We really don't care what the flow path follows. Best design per chamber drawing, shroud dimensions and inlet & outlet locations. (15)  QUESTION RECEIVED:  Will there be better drawings of the chamber available or should the potential supplier include  a visit to the facility to take measurements? If so, where is the chamber located and is access available? RESPONSE RECEIVED:  The drawing of the chamber and mock shroud are on the internet. A visit is welcome if the vendor would like to see the existing chamber. (16)  QUESTION RECEIVED:  An interior coating of black paint has been added to the shroud. Can you supply a suggested source for this material? RESPONSE RECEIVED:  Johnson Supply Co., 50 South East Street, PO Box 449, Pensacola FL 32592, (850)434-7103. Part number 463-3-8 with CA 118, Flat black Epoxy topcoat and TL-29 thinner. (17)  QUESTION RECEIVED:  Item 8 of your additions refers to an additional evacuation port and additional supply and return ports are to be added to the shield. These are 1/2" VCR. Can you clarify? What are these fittings attached to? Is it to the cooling shroud or the cooling tubes?  Or both? One implies to the shroud while the other seems to be to the cooling. Is there a schematic or sketch? RESPONSE RECEIVED:  The additional fittings need to be attached to the cooling tube path. One fitting is for evacuating the cooling tubes. The other two are cooling a cold plate that we will use in the chamber. Therefore, the cooling tubes will need an inlet and outlet fittings. The fittings will be male 1/2" VCR. The due date for receipt of quotes is extended UNTIL MAY 9, 2002.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD announces its intent to contract for a Noise Reduction System for the C-9B (DC-9-32F) Aircraft.  This effort will require a Federal Aviation Administration Supplemental Type Certificate for Navy C-9B Aircraft that meets or exceeds the Stage III Noise Levels as specified in the Federal Aviation Regulations, Chapter 1, Part36.5(a)3, appendix C.  This is a non-developmental effort; the Government is seeking a Noise Reduction System with proven performance in the commercial fleet.  In addition, the modification must meet the following requirements:

1.	The current approved Aircraft Maximum Takeoff Weight of 110,000 pounds must be maintained.
2.	The current approved Aircraft Maximum Landing Weight of 102,000 pounds with 40 degree Approach Flaps must be maintained.
3.	The rated engine thrust of a Stage II Configured Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9A engines, as currently used on the C-9B Aircraft, must not be adversely affected.
4.	Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption of the currently installed Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9A engines must not be adversely affected.
5.	Reliability and maintainability of Navy C-9B Aircraft and JT8D-9A Engines, as currently configured, must not be adversely affected.
6.	Any increase in Aircraft Empty Weight must not exceed 350 pounds.
7.	The system must be supportable by 2-level maintenance concept, O to D.
8.	The system should require no new or critical logistics support resource requirements.
9.	Must not require any additional transportability requirements.
10.     System should have no adverse impact on aircraft range, as currently configured.

The Government will require pre and post-Hushkit engine and aircraft performance data regarding, but not limited to, such factors as; Thrust, Fuel Flow (TSFC, Total Fuel Burn) and Acceleration (Spool-Up) Time.  The Goverment also desires an on-site review of all technical data presented by the Contractor to the FAA, as the basis for granting of the Stage III Hushkit STC.

The Government intends to award either one or two firm fixed price contracts for two of the major tasks required to complete this modification: 1. Acquisition of the STC Data and airframe parts required; and, 2.  Installation/integration of the airframe parts and JT8D-9A Engines, following modification o fthose engines to a Stage III configuration.  All work is to be accomplished in accordance with the FAA STC, the Navy Approved Aircraft Maintenance Manual, and the Pratt & Whitney Approved Maintenance Manual for the JT8D-9A Engine.  Prospective offerors may submit proposals for one, or both, of these tasks.  The offeror who provides the best overall value to the Government will be awarded a contract for that task.  If one offeror provides the best value for performing both tasks, one contract will be awarded to that offeror.    

This procurement will be conducted using the principles outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 ACQUISITION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  The Navy intends to release the Request for Proposals, including any subsequent amendments, only over the Internet.

<DESC>Expanded Defintional Mission for Desalination Projects in Algeria and Jordan. The Request for Proposal (RFP) for this synopsis will be issued on/about MAY 13, 2002 on FedBizOpps website.  The closing date will be MAY 28, 2002.  

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA) wishes to announce an opportunity for small business to bid on a Competitive Total Set-Aside to conduct a definitional mission to analyze proposed desalination projects for Algeria and Jordan.  In Algeria, the state-owned electricity and gas utility has requested TDA assistance for the construction of a desalination plant at its 120 MW steam cycle power plant located at the Port of Algiers.  In Jordan, the Aqaba Special Economic Zone (ASEZ) has requested TDA assistance to establish a desalination plant in the Southern Industrial Zone.  The contractor will be required to travel to Algeria, spending 3 full business days, and spend 2 full business days in Jordan to review the proposed projects.  The contract must be qualified to evaluate the economic, financial and technical viability of the proposed projects. The contractor will be required to prepare a final report to TDA that consists of a full review of all potential projects, paying particular attention to the likely interest of U.S. firms in these markets, and the project's likelihood for financing and producing U.S. exports.

The estimated cost for this work does not exceed $30,000.

TDA, located in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, promotes American private sector participation in developing and middle-income countries, with special emphasis on economic sectors that represent significant U.S. export potential. Through the funding of feasibility studies, orientation visits, specialized training grants, business workshops, and various forms of technical assistance, we help U.S. businesses compete for infrastructure projects in emerging markets.  We assist in building mutually beneficial partnerships between American companies and overseas project sponsors, which result in increased U.S. exports and jobs, and the completion of high quality, successful projects in host countries.  

The Small Business Act, at 15, U.S.C. 252, authorizes procuring agencies to aside procurements or portions of procurements for the exclusive participation of Small Businesses Concerns.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this procurement is 541330.

Definition: Small business concerns for purposes of TDA award of this total set aside contract means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operating for which it is bidding.  In determining whether dominance exists for TDAs purpose for this contract, consideration is given to annual gross receipts.  Any concern that is annual gross receipts above $5 million dollars, averaged over a three year period, is not considered small and is therefore, NOT eligible for award under this contract.

All participating organizations involved with supplying professional services must be incorporated or chartered in the United States.  Consultants planning teaming arrangements must be U.S. citizens or resident aliens.  In accordance with FAR 19.301, offerors will be required to submit self-certification relating to business size.  The competitive proposals method of solicitation as set forth in Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR Chapter 1) shall be utilized for this procurement.  This solicitation does not obligate TDA to award a contract, nor does it commit TDA to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposal.  Any explanation desired by an offeror regarding the meaning or interpretation of this solicitation must be requested in writing and with sufficient time allowed for reply to reach the offerors before submission of their offerors.  All oral explanations or instruction, given before award of this contract will not be binding.  Anyinformation given to a prospective offeror concerning the solicitation will be furnished promptly to all prospective offerors as an amendment of the solicitation, if such information is necessary to offerors submitting proposals or if lack of such information would be prejudicial to uninformed offerors.

The contractor must be in the position to present fair and unbiased information pursuant to the statement of work. 

U.S. eligible small businesses interested in receiving the RFP should download the RFP from the FedBizOpps website.  If there are any technical difficulties with downloading the RFP, send an email to contract@tda.gov identifying the technical difficulties.  If the contractor does not have electronic/email capabilities, the contractor may request the RFP by sending a letter by U.S. mail to the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA), Contracts Office, Room 200, 1621 N. Kent Street, Arlington, VA 22209-2131 or send a fax request to (703) 875-4009.  The letter or fax request should include name, address, city, state, zip code and telephone number.  If the contractor request the RFP to be sent via Federal Express, the contractor must include the contractor's Federal Express account number.  The Federal Express does not deliver to P.O. Boxes.  Therefore, if requesting Federal Express delivery, include street address.  If the contractor's Federal Express account number is not included in the RFP, the RFP will be sent by regular U.S. mail.  Requests made by email, letter, or fax requesting RFP to be sent by email will not be honored.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

Expanded Definitional Mission for Port Projects in Tunisia and Jordan 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) for this synopsis will be issued on/about MAY 13, 2002 on the FedBizOpps website.  The closing date will be MAY 28, 2002.

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA) wishes to announce an opportunity for small business to bid on a Competitive Total Set-Aside to conduct a definitional mission to analyze areas of potential TDA support in the port sectors in Jordan and Tunisia.  In Tunisia, two major priorities for Office de la Marine Marchande et des Ports (OMMP) concern the establishment of a cruise terminal complex at La Goulette and the development of vessel traffic management systems for the ports of Birzerte, Sfax, and Gabes.  In Jordan, Aqaba Special Economic Zone (ASEZ) has requested feasibility study assistance for the port relocation as well as desalination plant for the future.

Due to the lack of English language capability on the part of the Tunisian project sponsor, the selected consultant will be required to have working-level proficiency in French.  The contractor will be required to travel to Tunisia and Jordan to review the proposed projects.  The DM consultant will spend one week researching the Tunisian and Jordanian port sectors, as well as additional project information that may be identified.  Upon approval by TDA, the consultant will then travel to Tunisia and Jordan, spending at least four (4) full business days in Tunisia and two (2) full business days in Jordan.  The contract must be qualified to evaluate the economic, financial and technical viability of the proposed projects. The contractor will be required to prepare a final report to TDA that consists of a full review of all potential projects, paying particular attention to the likely interest of U.S. firms in these markets, and the project's likelihood for financing and producing U.S. exports.

<DESC>This is an advance notice to the public of a project to demolish a large concrete reinforced building at Grand Forks AFB, ND.  The project cost is expected to be between $1 and $5 million.  The applicable NAICS code is 235940.  Funding authority for this project is expected in mid summer with the possibility of making an award by 30 September.  If award is made by 30 September, on-site work to demolish the building must begin before 1 January 2003.  The main portion of the building is 4 floors, 72 feet high, with a footprint of about 23000 sq ft.  The walls and floors are reinforced concrete.  There are reinforced concrete columns supporting the floors and roof.  The total footprint for the building is approximately 55,000 sq ft.  The other areas are vehicle bays, mechanical rooms, etc.  We are seeking sources with experience in demolition of larger heavily reinforced buildings.  If you are interested in this upcoming project, you are requested to provide email notice to duane.mann@grandforks.af.mil.  Include the following information within your response - Company name, company address, point of contact, telephone number, business type and size.  In response a CD-ROM containing as-builts (tif format) will be provided.  They consist of over 500 drawings.  Prospective offerors are asked to review the as built drawings for structural details.  The drawings are old and out of date, but the building structure itself remains the same.  The included image files will reflect this information, but it may take some searching to find it.  The numbering system separates the drawings into projects.

<DESC>J-- The Naval Air Systems Command is seeking sources for the following effort:

The Navy will have a requirement for Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for at least 6 aircraft (current fleet) C-40A aircraft beginning in Fiscal Year 04.  It is possible the fleet size could grow by three aircraft a year through FY 09.  It is anticipated that the contract will consist of the base year plus 7 to 9 options.  The C-40 is a derivative of the Boeing commercial aircraft, 737-700. 

Examples of CLS would be:
a.	Site support
b.	Inventory management and support to include tracking and control of limited number of serially controlled parts; lease of engines, APUs, landing gear and control surfaces; providing consumables and expendables.  The Navy has limited Government owned spares.
c.	Engine Condition Monitoring
d.	Component Repair and Overhaul
e.	Engine, APU, landing gear and flight control surface repair/Overhaul
f.	Field Service Reps
g.	Depot level support (Scheduled and un-scheduled)
h.	Drop-in maintenance
i.	Site activation (new sites)

Currently, the C-40 is supported in accordance with FAA/Commercial practices.  The Navy has obtained maintenance and operational manuals for the C-40 that would be available under the CLS contract in accordance with the rights as provided to the Government under the current prime contract.  The successful offeror would be obligated to execute a Boeing Customer Services General Terms Agreement (GTA) or other appropriate proprietary information protection agreement with Boeing.
 
The Navy is contemplating procuring this support under either Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 12 or Part 15.  Any responses to this Request for Information are requested to indicate  under which method submission of a proposal would be precluded.
 
It is requested that companies with an interest in performing the above effort provide a response to this notice by e-mail: lewisjd4@navair.navy.mil; Fax: John Lewis, 301-757-8988 or mail:  Naval Air Systems Command address above. Attn: John Lewis, AIR-2.4.3.1.2 Bldg 441.  Please reference this notice.

This notice is a request for information to ascertain the potential market and the acquisition method that market would support for Contractor Logistics Support of the Navy C-40 aircraft fleet.  The Navy makes no representation or guarantees that a solicitation will be issued or that there would be a contract awarded.  The Government does not accept any liability for costs incurred in responding to this inquiry.

Place of Contract Performance. Site Support JRB, Fort Worth, TX; NAS Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL; and a projected site NAS, North Island, San Diego, CA.  Depot level support would be at Contractor's facilities.

<SUBJECT>A--UNIVERSITY PARTNERSHIPS IN SPACEPORT TECHNOLOGY
<DESC>1) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has identified technical interests that can best be advanced through consolidated grants to colleges and universities having exceptional expertise in or understanding of one or more of the areas as they relate to the mission of NASA-KSC. Proposals submitted should include new ideas and advanced and innovative concepts for current and emerging principles.  The technology proposal categories are: A.	Thermal Management at Cryogenic Temperatures Current thermal switches rely on electronic sensors to measure temperature and then use that information to turn on or off the switch.  Such decoupled systems are more complex and less reliable than other integrated sensor/switch systems. Using advanced materials technology, thermal switches can be made that integrate the sensor element and the actuator element.  NASA KSC is interested in developing such thermal switches for a variety of Human Exploration and Development of Space (HEDS) applications.  Included in this are switches used to control liquid methane temperature and pressure in a zero boil off system, possibly dumping heat to a liquid oxygen tank in a common bulkhead arrangement.  Thermal switches can also be used to create a variable thermal sink to other cryogenic tanks for liquefaction, densification, and zero boil off systems for advanced spaceport applications.  Such switches can also be used as a temperature control device for a 3-way flow control valve, possibly for use on ammonia systems in a space environment.  KSC would like to develop a switch that is used for the first application mentioned above, to support methane liquefaction for Mars missions.  The switch should be able to allow a thermal conduction of approximately 8 watts between two liquid reservoirs held at 118 K and 92 K.  The switch would be tested in a common bulkhead tank arrangement at the cryogenic testbed. B.	Autonomous Harvester Current human space missions rely primarily on packaged, freeze-dried foods as the main form of nourishment for the crew.  As the mission durations increases, consumables resupply will become more costly due to constraints on mass and volume.  A remedy to this problem would be to supply fresh salad and fruits grown in controlled environments as a dietary supplement for the crew.  In addition to the trade economics of life support, there are potential psychological considerations relating to astronauts eating a diet exclusively of packaged foods.  Food requirements for long duration space missions will most likely incorporate fresh foods such as: tomato, spinach, lettuce, radish, carrot, green onion, herbs, strawberry, pepper, and others. Harvesting of these foods is another issue that must be addressed.  Automating harvesting activities to reduce the crew involvement would allow the crew to concentrate on scientific or technical activities.  One potential example crop that requires harvesting would be the tomato. The challenges or objectives of an autonomous harvester are to locate the fruit, harvest the fruit, and transport/store the fruit.  Locating the fruit is not as straightforward as one would think.  The autonomous system must have remote sensing capabilities to "recognize" the fruit from the plant canopy as well as determine suitable ripeness.  Also, targeting fruit at varying heights and obscured behind leaves poses another challenge.  The software needs to be able to adapt to these changing conditions as the plant matures.  The second objective of harvesting the fruit is difficult as well because of the soft nature of the fruit.  Harvesting the fruit requires an end effector that can close around the fruit and remove it from the plant without damaging the fruit or damaging the plant.  Transporting the fruit to a storage container is the final sequence.  The end effector must then be able to articulate such that the fruit can be gently placed in a storage bin without bruising the fruit.  Other desirable features of an autonomous harvester include the operation of the autonomous harvester through the three sequences above must occur within a reasonable timeframe to make it advantageous, the system must have low power, low mass, and be highly reliable, and the system should multitask (e.g. assist on pollination requirements and have applicability to other salad and fruit plants).   The project goal would be to demonstrate the feasibility of an autonomous harvester system for tomatoes.   The project schedule should be broken down into meeting each one of the objectives with a summary report and a laboratory demonstration.  Applications for such a system include extraterrestrial greenhouses/farms where the optimal conditions for plants may not be suitable for humans and may be separated from the crew areas.  Spacecrafts used for long duration missions may also require an autonomous harvester to reduce the crew time associated with those tasks.  An autonomous harvester and the technologies associated with the objectives will have direct applicability to food production on Earth.  (2) Pursuant to 32 CFR Sec. 22.315 and Sec. 22.320, this announcement is open only to eligible U.S. colleges and universities.  Proposals from minority universities are encouraged.

<SUBJECT>R -- Technical, Engineering and Management Support for the Navy Global Positioning System control Display Navigation Unit Computer Software Configuration Item including Software Activity Support
<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River, Maryland intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Raytheon Technical Services Company (Raytheon), 6125 East 21st Street, Indianapolis, IN 46219-2058. In 1996 NAWCAD Indianapolis was closed and privatized in-place in accordance with recommendations from the 1995 Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission.  Title to the preponderance of all personal property located at NAWCAD Indianapolis has been transferred to Raytheon.  Raytheon possesses land and facilities formerly comprising NAWCAD Indianapolis under the terms of a long term lease agreement with the City of Indianapolis acting by and through the Department of Metropolitan Development.  The requirement will provide for the furnishing of technical, engineering, and management support for the Navy Global Positioning System (GPS) Control Display Navigation Unit (CDNU) Computer Software Configuration Item (CSCI), including Software Support Activity (SSA) support.  These integrated functional capabilities were previously provided by the NAWCAD Indianapolis in support of the Navigation Systems Program.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-(1)(2)(iii) services may be deemed available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government?s requirements. The term of the resulting contract is planned to be a one-year base period with up to four one-year options.  Raytheon is the only known responsible source that can provide the required integrated functional capabilities and services.  Interested parties may submit questions relating to this requirement to the NAWCAD Patuxent River, Maryland.  The Government retains the right not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice.  See Numbered Note 22.
