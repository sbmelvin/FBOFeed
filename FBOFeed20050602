<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration, Integrated Computing Environment-Mainframe And Network (ICE-MAN) Program Management Office (PMO) officials are in the process of determining requirements for a follow-on to Reimbursable Agreement DTFA01-97-C-00026.  However, as a result of inconsistency in customer base and continued decline of platform utilization, the ICE-MAN PMO cannot currently and adequately size its requirement for a planned competitive follow-on, and is uncertain whether a requirement will exist at all.  For reasons discussed above, the PMO plans to extend the agreement performance end date (September 30, 2005) an additional six months to March 2005 with the incumbent source.  This extension will further accommodate procurement planning already in progress.

SCOPE:  The PHMSA Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) conducted a Government/Industry Pipeline R&D Forum in Houston, Texas on March 22 - 24, 2005. The 2.5 day event included approximately 185 representatives from Federal, State and international government agencies, public representatives, research funding organizations, standards organizations, and pipeline operators from the U.S. and Canada.  The R&D forum led to a common understanding of current research efforts, a listing of key challenges facing government and industry, and a compilation of potential research areas whose exploration can help meet these challenges and should therefore be considered in the development of new R&D applications. Only topics described in this BAA and identified at the R&D forum will be addressed.  Not all topics identified at the R&D forum fit within the mission of the OPS at this time and may not be represented in this BAA.  Further details on the research topics identified can be found in the R&D forum proceedings and technical report-out presentations.  To view the R&D forum proceedings and technical report-out presentations, please visit: http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/rd/mtg_032305.htm. 

To gain a historical prospective of the OPS R&D research goals, strategy and several previous pipeline stakeholder events as well as descriptions of all awarded research, visit the OPS R&D Program webpage at http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/rd/index.htm .  

Measuring how research outputs are transferred to the end user is a top priority for OPS R&D Program.  This BAA seeks research topics that: 1) Can produce results in the short-term (1-3 years), 2) Have progressed successfully past the proof of concept, 3) Contribute to the development of technology, strengthen consensus standards, or 4) Provide general knowledge for decision makers.  A response to this BAA must 1) Clearly identify the ultimate goals of the proposed project; or 2) Contribute technology or knowledge to organizations that supply technology in the field or to organizations seeking to develop or update industry consensus standards.  

The US DOT PHMSA is seeking white papers on individual projects and on consolidated R&D programs that address the following pipeline safety program areas.  A consolidated R&D program white paper from the team lead organization should identify opportunities for integrated R&D that could involve contributions from several organizations whose combined expertise will contribute greater efficiency and effectiveness to R&D in the proposed program areas.  Examples of program and project focus within the desired program areas are presented below.  Details of the intent of the listed projects can be located in the R&D forum proceedings and technical report-out presentations, shown at: http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/rd/mtg_032305.htm. 

1.  Damage Prevention --   

Technology development of avoidance sensors on digging/boring equipment - A project could identify current technologies to be refined or a new tool or avoidance sensor to be developed.  As part of the R&D, end users of this technology should be identified and provide technical specifications to develop best practice guidelines and increase the chances that the research output will be applied.  One Call procedures and pertinent insurance standards used by the pipeline industry could be factored to flow chart the entire process for the application of the technology.

2.  Mechanical Damage -- 

Enhance & validate Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) inspection technology for locating existing mechanical damage - A project could enhance assessment for qualitative screening and ranking of existing mechanical damage.  Field validation under real operating conditions could be used to benchmark the application of this tool or method. 

3.  Direct Assessment --

A.  Identify, develop and demonstrate tools and techniques to fill the gaps and expand the applicability of External Corrosion Direct Assessment (ECDA) - A project could survey existing technologies for applicability and short term potential.  Expand and demonstrate capability and reliability of the existing technologies identified without duplicating any existing efforts underway; or create new knowledge and technology to address the specific problem and capture applications in standard and/or recommended practice.  In any event, submitted projects must contribute to expanding the range of applicability of ECDA and to the demonstration of the effectiveness of ECDA in these expanded areas.
 
B.  Characterize the accuracy and range and applicability of Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment (ICDA) methods and characterize which models apply to what situations - A project could survey existing technologies and methodologies for applicability, and develop protocols on how to apply ICDA methods. The candidate ICDA methods and protocols should lead (especially those focused on wet gas and liquids) to quantifying and validating the accuracy, applicability and functionality of the models evaluated.  The project results can be incorporated into a standard and/or recommended practice.

C.  Identify and develop practical approaches to characterize the impact of and reduce the number of uncertainties in Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment (ICDA) application - A project could pinpoint locations and optimize length of ICDA excavations.  It could survey existing technologies and methodologies and applicability.  The project could develop protocols, demonstrate ICDA methods (especially those focused on wet gas and liquids) and incorporate results into existing standards. 

D.  Identify, develop, demonstrate tools and techniques for expanding their applicability and ability to detect Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) - A project should survey existing technologies for applicability and short term potential.  Expand and demonstrate capability and reliability of the existing technologies identified without duplicating any existing efforts underway; or create new knowledge and technology to address the specific problem and capture application in standard and/or recommended practice.

4.  Inspection -- 

A.  Investigate fundamentals and performance characteristics of current sensor technologies - A project could identify current capabilities of many inspection technologies used in the pipeline industry.  Currently there is a growing need to validate the data and assessment information captured during inline inspection while tying these results back to fundamentals and performance characteristics.

B.  Developing inspection technologies for non-metallic pipelines - A project could identify current technologies available to inspect non-metallic pipe.  Technology gaps identified could be used to develop technologies that will inspect these pipes in the methods and techniques similar to metallic pipelines.

5.  Leak Detection --

Enhancement of tools for computational pipeline monitoring - A project could identify how computational monitoring for leak detection can be enhanced through the development of new tools or methods.  The project could incorporate technology development with best practice guidelines to maximize effectiveness.

6.  Pipeline Design --

A.  Conduct testing to support a comprehensive set of design tools for pipeline strain based design - A project could provide engineering data to support and validate the existing government and industry research effort for strain based design.  The current effort has drafted a comprehensive design standard for strain based design.  Much of the guidance drafted from this research requires engineering data to support this standard.

B.  Improve predictive tools for pipeline loading under large scale movement and adverse environmental conditions - A project could consider a comprehensive investigation to address all associated engineering issues.  The current methodology for predicting loads on pipelines is not sufficient, particularly with regard to large scale ground movements and environmentally imposed loads. Further, the project could incorporate material and site property data to support application of predictive tools. 

7.  Other Safety Improvements --

A.  E-Communications – A project could work with public safety agencies, “One Call” centers, and the telecommunications industry to integrate voice, data, geospatial and graphical communications to enable common devices (cell phones, PDAs, computers, and others) to communicate effectively.

B.  Human Factors -  A project could discuss research on operator fatigue, human-centered systems, and man machine interaction. Research topics of interest include technologies and procedures designed to minimize operator error, research on the effects of managing pipeline controller shift change and potential solutions for minimizing those effects, human interface in incident/accident management, and other portions of the pipeline operating system.  An exisitng government and industry research should be coordinatded with to maximixe attainment of this topic’s goal. 

WHITE PAPERS: PHMSA is soliciting white papers on individual projects as well as consolidated R&D programs in support of the specified program areas.  Each proposal must include a cost sharing contribution of at least fifty percent of the proposed project's cost in order to be considered. Each white paper must not exceed five pages and must include the following:  1) A description of the state-of-the-art in the area being proposed; 2) Actions proposed to advance that state with a quantifiable method to measure the improvement anticipated upon completion of the project; 3) Examples of past performance that demonstrate the ability of an offeror to compete further from white papers to proposals; and 4) Examples, if any, of prior awarded research with DOT.   The entire White Paper submission package, including the White Paper itself (5 pages maximum), and all attachments, appendices and backup materials, must not exceed fifteen pages in total.  The package must include the contact information previously described, and sufficient information to evaluate the following areas: 
1. Offeror’s understanding and description of the state of the art in the proposed research area.
The degree to which the offeror identifies the current status of the technology in the research area it is proposing to address, including previous work done by the offeror and others in the proposed R&D area and appropriateness of how the prior work relates to the proposed application of the technology. Adequacy and feasibility of the applicant’s approach to achieving stated objectives.
2. Scientific and technical merit of proposal to advance pipeline safety.
The degree to which the proposed technology or methodology is based on sound scientific and engineering principles. The degree to which the proposal will advance pipeline safety, if the work is successful. 
3. Adequacy and feasibility of technical approach and realism of cost estimate.
Appropriateness, rationale, and completeness of the applicant's technical approach. The adequacy of the proposed project schedule, staffing plan and planned travel to complete the proposed work. The realism of the cost estimate to meet objectives and deliver products in the proposed timeline. The likelihood that the proposed work will be successful and develop a new successful technology.
4. Technical experience and capabilities of the offeror in Federal research programs.
Credentials, capabilities and experience of key personnel. Demonstrated corporate experience of the applicant and participating organizations in managing similar projects that are similar to the proposal in size, complexity, and technology. The adequacy of the facilities and equipment to perform project tasks.
5. Timeline to implement proposed technologies or concepts into practice into the pipeline industry. 
Overall potential timeline of the proposed technology to become an accepted commercial product if work is successful.
6. State of the application and coordination and collaboration with end users to implement proposed technologies or concepts into the pipeline industry. (Criteria to be used during full proposal evaluation only)
If applicable, the proposed research should identify whether the deliverable addresses technology or consensus standards.  The offeror could include scope items that coordinate with standard organizations and or vendor technology organizations increasing the chance that project results will be applied or commercialized.  Items such as invitations to project meetings, providing copies of milestone reports and drafting project outputs in formats recognized with that organization are suggested. The offeror could provide clarity, logic and likely effectiveness of project organization including subcontractors to successfully complete the project.  
7. As appropriate, information on capabilities of the lead company and other collaborators expected to participate in consolidated R&D Programs. (Criterion to be used during full proposal evaluation of Consolidated Programs only)
PHMSA is looking for the increased scientific and technical merit of the consolidated program itself versus that of its individual projects. We are looking not simply for project management assistance, but for the increased value added by adopting a more integrated approach to addressing a known technical challenge to pipeline safety. Therefore, successful proposals for consolidated programs will clearly articulate both how the individual technical projects interrelate and are sequenced to maximize the benefits. Such proposals will also clearly articulate how the proposed approach will deliver significantly greater improvements in either knowledge or technical solutions to clearly identified challenges than if these projects were pursued individually or in a different sequence; the adequacy and availability of the personnel, facilities and equipment to perform project tasks; and the demonstrated corporate experience of the applicant and participating organizations in managing similar projects.

All evaluation factors are of equal importance.

Solicitation No. DTRT57-05-Q-80138 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, replacing cancelled solicitation No. DTRT57-05-Q-80127, which was issued as a small business set aside. This document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-03. This procurement is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), and FAR Part 12, Commercial Item Procedures.  The NAICS Code is 541990 and the small business size standard is no more tha n $6.0 million dollars.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; competitive proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), an agency of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), supports the modal administrations of the DOT through the conduct of engineering studies and research and development activities necessary to evaluate and improve transportation safety and performance.  The Volpe Center is providing analytical support on behalf of the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) to provide evaluation and testing of the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) accuracy, availability, and integrity in maritime applications. The Volpe Center requires the serv ices of a Contractor to perform data analysis and provide documentation related to its analysis and evaluation of the impact of WAAS on marine radio-navigation users. INTRODUCTION: The FAA has developed the WAAS for aviation use. WAAS is an extremely accurate navigation system developed for civil aviation. WAAS is capable of providing horizontal and vertical navigation for precision approach operations for all classes of aircraft in all flight navigations, including en route navigation, airport departures, and airport arrivals.  The WAAS achieved Initial Operation Capability (IOC) in July 2003. FAA testing of WAAS confirmed accuracy performance of 1-2 meters horizontal and 2-3 meters vertical throughout the majority of the continental United States and portions of Alaska. Increasing number s of WAAS receivers have emerged in the public marketplace and are being used in maritime regions. As a result, comprehensive evaluation and testing of WAAS accuracy, availability, and integrity in maritime applications is required (e.g., buoy positioning, harbor entrance approach navigation, and inland waterway navigation). The evaluation and testing shall include an in-depth study of the differences between the performance parameter definitions and requirements for marine and aviation applications, a review of the existing model for WAAS coverage, adapting the concurrent or creating a new WAAS model(s) and then examining the performance of the model(s). The latter effort is expected to require collection of GPS and WAAS data from multiple sites within the United States. OBJECTIVE: The ob jective of this requirement is to determine whether the WAAS augmentation system satisfies the performance requirements for maritime navigation and positioning applications. The evaluation shall be conducted using processes similar to those used to determine whether Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS) meet these requirements and shall be supported by data collection efforts conducted in dynamic (navigation) as well as static (positioning) operations.

<DESC>P- High Frequency Single Side-Band Network


The U.S. Customs and Border Protection intends to award a requirements type contract for the acquisition of additional High Frequency Single Side-band Network Systems (HF/SSB). 

The following instructions outline the minimum requirements to Rockwell Collins Government Systems, 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, IA 52498 for the HF/SSB systems operating within the HF/SSB network.  The proposed network must be capable of operating with existing CBP HF/SSB voice operated signal-to-noise squelch, voice only equipment that is composed of HF/SSB radios of various styles and manufacturers. Due to the tactical nature of CBP operations, a voice privacy unit for unclassified, sensitive traffic and a Government furnished COMSEC unit for classified traffic protects the voice communications. Due to the large number of systems in service in the network at this time, significant importance will be placed on the degree to which the offerors systems can perform within the existing network.  Because of the urgency of the requirement and the fact that law enforcement officers operate the equipment, rather than by radio operators, link reliability, automation, user friendliness, network expansion, capability, history of field usage, documentation, and delivery are considered to be of paramount importance.  For this reason, only radios, automatic controllers, and voice privacy units with a production history will be considered.  The network shall consist of the following systems:


·	Fixed Station (FS)
·	Fixed Station Transmitter Selector (FSTS) System
·	Remote Command & Control (RCC)
·	Telephone to Radio Interface Communications System (TRICS)
·	Secure Link Interface Communications (SLIC)
·	Public Switched Telephone Network RCC (PSTN-RCC)
·	RCC Interface System (RCC-IS)
·	Marine and Airborne Mobile (MOBILE)
·	Tracking and Communication System (TRACS)
·	Transportable 
·	Vehicular Mounted Systems
·	HF Cellular System
·	Network Activity System (NAS)


The contract period of performance is from 10-01-05 through 09-30-06 with the possibility of  4 option years. 

This notice is for informational purposes only. No formal solicitation will be made available to the public.

Any inquiries shall be e-mailed to Elizabeth.Heitz@dhs.gov  No phone calls will be accepted.

The required period of performance for this requirement is six months after contract award.  The required delivery for the option items, if exercised, shall be 45 days after exercise of option. The requirement requires the contractor to provide the necessary personnel and material to develop a dust palliative in accordance with the Task Descriptions listed below. The objective of this requirement is to develop a dust palliative to control dust in helicopter operations with a single application process. The requirement will include an option to purchase up to 3,150 pounds of dust palliative chemicals to treat approximately one hundred and fifty-eight thousand (158,000) square feet of soil in Iraq if the product proves successful in Limited Technical As! sessments (LTA) conducted in the continental United States. TASK DESCRIPTIONS.  In conjunction with the development, the contractor shall perform the following functions: a. Successfully create palliative coatings developed and tested in the laboratory, and then apply the optimized solution in the field to test in a desert (arid soil) environment; b. Document efforts toward achieving contract efforts in the form of status reports. This shall consist of identifying accomplishments to date and difficulties encountered, and a comparison of the status achieved to planned goals and the resources expended; c. Scientifically evaluate the soil binders using x-ray diffraction equipment and mechanical testing techniques and provide the results in a report in accordance with industry standards; d. Determine toxicity data for proposed solution through a federally recognized hygiene laboratory to ensure safety of proposed chemical solution and provide a report on it in accordance with in! dustry standards; e. Coordinate with the Joint Rapid Airfield Construction (JRAC) Program Manager, Airfields and Pavements Branch, Engineering Systems and Materials Division, Geotechnical and Structures Laboratory, United States Army Engineer Research and Development Center ((ERDC) Vicksburg, MS) in regards to a government analysis of product material properties in a laboratory setting. This includes analysis of use with application equipment to support the dust palliative; f. Evaluate the performance of palliatives in reducing dust under rotary-wing aircraft traffic for each completed helipad using a variety of methods. This includes adhere to product evaluation criterion which will be provided in solicitation.  Note: researchers from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) JRAC program team (the lead federal agency in this field) on 13 April 2005, recommended that dust reduction levels should be greater than 30% of the total rating. This recommendation will apply to testi! ng requirements outline under Basic Requirement; and g. Develop instructional material for, and train designated Marine Corps personnel to handle and apply the palliative for approved purposes, and as part of designated conditions. The objectives are required to ensure the timeline is met for demonstration of dust control technology, which will be published by the MCWL project officer no later than 15 July 2005. BASIC REQUIREMENT. The contractor shall develop a palliative in accordance with CLIN 0001 and shall be used for testing in accordance with the testing required. Testing will be conducted in lab and field, and shall be ready for field-testing within thirty (30) days of contract award. The palliative shall have the following characteristics: (a) That it be in dry crystal or powdered form until mixed with agitated water; (b) Not clog or form clumps when agitated and or when being dispersed; (c) That can be stored in liquefied form for a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours!  without hardening or clumping; (d) That once dispersed will form a hard surface crust of a minimum of fifty (50) pounds per square inch per one (1) inch soil saturation; (e) That will harden (cure) for helicopter landing use within twenty-four (24) hours; (f) That once hardened the palliative shear strength withstand multiple helicopter landings per day for a minimum of thirty  (30) days from aircraft with a minimum gross weight of 11,000 pounds (from CH 46 aircraft 11,000 pounds and CH53 E aircraft 22,000 pounds); (g) That will not break down in ultra violet light for a minimum of sixty (60) days; (h) That is not sensitive to temperatures between twenty (20) degrees Fahrenheit, and degrees 120 Fahrenheit; (i) That is not hazardous if exposed to skin for less than twenty (20) minutes whether dry or wet; and(j) That product residue or runoff be removed from support equipment with simple cleaning solutions e.g. 5% bleach, eight (8) ounce baking soda per one (1) gallon of wate! r. The contractor shall provide performance data from laboratory or field research to confirm product capability prior to source selection phase in their response to the solicitation. The contractor shall carry our test objectives at a site to be confirmed by the project officer. The contractor shall carry out test objective and standard methods for this effort utilized by USACE in accordance with the Attached. This includes but is not limited to: a. The contract or shall collect samples of the surface soil at the test site and subject them to gradation and Atterberg Limit tests for classification according to the Universal Soil Classification System (USCS) prior to conducting field tests; b. The contractor shall evaluate the test site by structurally by conducting a suite of strength tests including the dynamic cone penetro-meter (DCP) tests, vane shear tests, and Torvane shear tests. Nuclear moisture/density data will be collected for each helipad for comparison; c. Test c! riterion for product evaluation will be in accordance with the attached; d. During aircraft trafficking dust samplers will be place downwind of selected helipads to collect samples of airborne dust generated during the traffic sequence.  The filter paper from the dust samplers will be weighed to compare the amount of airborne material generated by each helipad.  The wind direction and velocity along with pertinent temperature information will be documented periodically during the exercise; e.  Visual observations by the participants and pilots will be gathered for subjective evaluations of product performance.  In the absence of adequate rotary-wing traffic, small sections of each helipad will be subjected to controlled air blasts from a gas-powered blower to subjectively evaluate the palliative’s penetration depth and effectiveness.  The wind velocity produced by the blower during each test will be measured on site. Success in this effort will be based on the ability of the!  palliative to mitigate dust from the above listed test as well as in the following paragraph in; f. The palliative shall also be judged based upon comparisons of the qualitative and quantitative data collected by USACE on previous palliative product testing and control helipads.  The application procedures and material quantities will also be noted and considered as factors affecting the performance of each helipad.  Excessive logistical requirements in terms of support equipment, procedures, and material quantities will degrade the composite evaluation of each product due to the requirement for an “expeditionary” capability.  For the purposes of the MCWL evaluation, “expeditionary” capability is defined as a maximum product application rate of 1,600  gallons per 150 ft x 150 ft helicopter landing zone (LZ); and g. The palliative will be applied with an approved expeditionary application system designated hydro-seeder equipment via horizontal  spray bar, and hose and nozzle!  apparatus. Hydro-seeders manufactured by Finn Corp. (model T-90) are currently in use by Marine Corps units. The contractor shall prepare documentation that records the development and testing of dust palliative technology. The format may be based on contractor preference however when submitted to MCWL it must indicate its relevant to status reports and technical reports (Subparagraph 3.3). The contractor shall assist MCWL Technology Division personnel in the development and documentation of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures in support of dust palliative technology. This documentation shall be prepared for training of Marines to handle and apply the product. The contractor shall provide up two (2) days of training (approximately eight (8) hours per day) dust abatement training to a maximum of twelve (12) Marines at Vicksburg, Mississippi, MCAS Yuma Arizona, or Marine Corps Base, Camp LeJeune, North Carolina. The objective of the training shall be on application methods wi! th the palliative. Instruction shall be conducted with the aid of a user guide in ‘classroom environment’ followed by contractor demonstration, and student application. Actual training dates will be provided via contract modification. The contractor shall provide training manuals on the use and Application of the dust palliative to the project officer for review no later than twenty-one (21) days prior to the start of training instruction. The results of the project officer’s review will be submitted to the contractor within seven (7) days. Any changes suggested by the project officer will be made by the contractor within seven (7) days. If the option is exercised by the contracting officer, the contractor shall provide a minimum of 3,150 pounds of palliative for extended user evaluation by Marine Corps personnel. The contractor shall provide a minimum of seven (7) user guides over packed with shipment of palliative. The user guides shall include Material Safety Data Sheets,!  toxicity data, and palliative application instructions for different environmental conditions (temperature, moisture etc.), soil conditions,  pressure settings (based on ground distance), and ground saturation thresholds and objective.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations.  FAR Clauses: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation ! and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on cre! ating and entering your MPIN).The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for RENEWAL OF I-DEAS MAINTENANCE OF AGREEMENT INCLUDING TECHNICAL SUPORT AND UPDATES AND SOLUTIONS FOR I-DEAS CODE. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from UGS Corporation as the only known source available to provide updates and renewals to the software.  UGS is the manufacturer of I-DEAS and it would cost the Government thousands of dollars and hundreds of manhours in training and reconfiguration if the software were to be replaced.  It is determined that only one source is reasonably available for this effort.  Sole Source authority FAR 13.106-1 is applicable. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 06-17-05.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA MSFC plans to continue their Site Licenses Agreement (SLA) to allow NASA MSFC to use existing Visual Manufacturing software for up to five years, including any software updates developed during the term of the SLA.	The proposed SLA will have an initial period of performance (POP) of one year and an option provision to extend the POP in one-year increments for up to four additional years.  The proposed SLA will cover 1 license for up to 50 users for Visual Manufacturing software and will also require that the contractor furnish MSFC with all software updates.  NASA MSFC plans to continue the SLA with Infor Global Solutions on a sole-source basis pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. Competition is impractical for the following reasons:	 1.  Visual Manufacturing Software is currently used in the Center’s fabrication shop and a renewal of the SLA is needed for software technical support and upgrades.  Infor Global Solutions (who recently acquired Lilly Software Associates, the software developer) is the sole owner of the Visual Manufacturing software and the only source for the license agreements and software updates.   2.  The aforementioned software has a unique capability and is the only software available that will satisfy MSFC’s requirements.  It is the only software package that offers a scheduling capability, which is a critical function to the manufacturing services at MSFC. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 17, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The National Park Service at the Statue of Liberty National Monument is issuing a commercial solicitation (Request for Quotation - RFQ) for the cataloging of an estimated 2700 historic cylinder-format phonograph records at Edison National Historic Site (ENHS) in West Orange, New Jersey.  The performance of the work shall take place at Edison National Historic Site in the recorded sound storage vault: a high security, windowless, temperature, and humidity-controlled archival storage facility. The solicitation, to include the Statement of Work and Wage Determination, will be posted to the Governmentwide Point of Entry (GPE) website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about June 17, 2005.  The NAICS 2002 code for this project is 519120 with a size standard of six million dollars, ($6,000,000.00). The archive at Edison National Historic Site includes approximately a total of 10,000 cylinder phonograph records produced by Thomas Edison in West Orange, New Jersey, between the years 1888 and 1929.  Many of these have been at the Laboratory since Edison's lifetime.  Some of the earliest examples of recorded sound in existence are preserved within this unique collection.  The cylinder record objects are very fragile.  All of the cylinders are rare, many are totally unique.  The utmost of care must be used when handling and moving the items.  The subject matter of the recordings is mostly music, covering genres popular in the United States during Edison's era:  popular songs, instrumental classical, opera, brass band marches, ragtime, country, minstrelsy, dance bands, and spirituals.  Spoken word recordings include vaudeville comedy sketches, documentary speeches, educational lessons, and motion picture soundtracks.  Experimental recordings document research carried out at the Edison Laboratory to develop early-recorded sound technologies.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to award a contract for a coordinating center for the National Children’s Study (NCS or Study).  Background information on the NCS is available at www.NationalChildrensStudy.gov.  The NCS is a large, long-term longitudinal study of environmental influences on children’s health and development.  This Study will explore a broad range of environmental factors, both helpful and harmful, that influence the health and development of children.   For this Study, environment is broadly defined to include biological, chemical, physical, social and behavioral influences on children.  The range of outcomes include, for example, obesity, diabetes and physical development; injuries; asthma; pregnancy-related outcomes; and, mental health issues.  Likewise, a wide range of environmental influences will be examined for their impact on children’s health and development.  These include, but are not limited to air pollutants, drinking water contaminants, soil and dust contaminants, dietary nutrients, dietary contaminants, parental occupational exposures, infectious and allergic agents, infections, genetics, and social and behavioral characteristics.  The Study’s goal is to better understand the role of how these factors, alone and in combination, affect or are associated with children’s health, disease and development.  The NCS will include a sample of approximately 100,000 children born in the U.S.  Vanguard Centers will start enrollment in 2007 and full Study Centers are anticipated to begin enrolling in 2008. Enrolled women and, when possible, their partners will be assessed for a wide range of exposures and personal characteristics early in pregnancy or upon pre-pregnancy enrollment.  Monitoring of the mother’s exposures will continue throughout pregnancy to birth, and possibly beyond.  The child will then be followed for a wide range of health and developmental outcomes and NCS defined environmental exposures throughout childhood until at least 21 years of age.  A leading strategy for enrollment of Study participants is to recruit through approximately 30-50 Study Centers across the country using a probability-based sampling framework.  The Government intends to directly award competitive contracts to each of the 30-50 Study Centers, with a separate contract award for the coordinating center (the subject of this solicitation).  The NCS Coordinating Center (NCS-CC) will work with the NCS Project Officer (NCS-PO) and with the NCS Information Technology contractor (IT contractor, which has been previously awarded under a separate contract), the Study Centers, Central Laboratories, and Central Repository(ies) to complete the initial implementation of the Study, conduct pilot studies of proposed protocol elements, coordinate large-scale pilot field studies of the full protocol; conduct various statistical analyses; provide reports on Study results as needed and directed by the NCS-PO; and serve as an independent Study Center, when needed.  As an independent Study Center, the NCS-CC must be capable of handling the responsibilities of a Study Center, which will initially include those activities found in the Vanguard Centers RFP (see the http://www.fedbizopps.gov  listing for National Children’s Study Vanguard Centers).   An offeror for the NCS-CC must have the ability to:  1) organize, conduct, and manage large multi-site longitudinal studies involving the collection of interview, biologic, clinical, and environmental data; 2) develop a detailed Manual of Operating Procedures specifying procedures for participant enrollment, retention, confidentiality and ethics, plus data and sample collection, testing, management, transportation and storage; 3) organize, conduct, and manage a range of methods development and pilot studies, including pilot testing of the full NCS Protocol at the Vanguard Centers (however, not all methods development studies will utilize the Vanguard Centers); 4) assist the NCS Study Centers in designation and recruitment of Study participants; 5) demonstrate statistical expertise to assist the NCS Project Officer in identifying additional Study sites and participants following selection of the Vanguard Centers;  6) maintain and augment the nationwide network of Study Centers should the need arise for establishing new Study Centers to supplement recruitment of specific subgroups or follow-up of Study subjects that relocate out of the established network; 7) assist the Project Officer and Study sites in preparation of materials to be submitted for required reports and clearances e.g. reviews and clearances  by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), application(s) for Certificates of Confidentiality, etc; 8) assist Study Centers in gaining community support and input to optimize subject recruitment, retention and dissemination of Study findings and coordinate national public outreach; 9) track Study participants throughout the course of the NCS, including assisting sites in their participant retention efforts, as needed, and in tracking participants when they move from their original Study site; 10) schedule the collection of interview data and biologic, clinical, and environmental samples; cataloguing and tracking the data and samples from Centers to the NCS-CC, laboratories, or repository(ies); linking the data and results to the appropriate individuals; and identifying missing data components for individual participants; 11) collaborate with the NCS IT contractor to develop, maintain and provide the resources for the information systems needed to support such a large multi-site Study, including management of data from disparate sources described above, and potential data management issues associated with the collection and analysis of genetic data; 12) monitor the quality of data collection, editing, auditing, entry and analysis, including a plan for monitoring potential adverse events among Study participants; 13) develop and implement quality control procedures, including adherence to good clinical and laboratory practices, Center audits, in-house data audits, and database validation, audits of field data collection procedures including accompanying field data collectors for a sample of visits; 14) train and certify data collectors in each of the Study sites; 15) provide evidence of having qualified and experienced personnel to establish working relationships with Study sites (Vanguard and subsequent), Central Laboratories and Repository(ies)  and oversee all aspects of the Study; 16) prepare data for various statistical analyses, as needed; 17) conduct statistical analyses and provide results of these analyses to Study investigators, as needed; 18) carry out methods development and feasibility analyses to aid in the identification of the additional Study Centers and characterization of participants within each Study Center; 19) develop and distribute public use and restricted access datasets; 20) participate in the preparation of scientific articles and reports summarizing results of the Study; and, 21) implement a probability-based sampling framework for Study participant recruitment.   

The required service is defined as code 541990 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or after November 16, 2004 through the web site at http://FedBizOpps.gov  (FBO). It is imperative that all potential offerors also review the NCS Vanguard Centers’ RFP, as referenced in the FBO.  This acquisition is NOT set-aside for small businesses, i.e., all capable organizations are invited to submit proposals.  While this acquisition is being conducted using full and open competition, proposals must include maximum utilization of small business subcontracting, as appropriate.  Of course, small businesses may compete, alone, for the full acquisition.  A Pre-proposal Conference for the NCS-CC solicitation will be held on December 1, 2004 at a site to be determined, in the Washington DC area.  The specifics of this Conference will be included when the RFP is issued/released.   Questions should be sent to Virginia A.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,   (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with The Ambulatory Pediatric Association, McLean, Va.

Purpose:
The APA Young Investigator Research Annual Program and AHRQ encourage faculty to conduct research with emphasis on child health promotion, teaching, patient care and health care delivery projects in general pediatrics.  AHRQ encourages projects focused on translating research into practice. 
This program will provide training opportunities to conduct research focusing on one of AHRQ's priority populations (children) as outlined in AHRQ's strategic plan.  This is the only organization that has established such a program and AHRQ feels this is the only organization that can enhance research knowledge and growth for potential pediatric researchers.   The APA mission is accomplished through patient care, academics (teaching and research), and advocacy-Patient safety is a major initiative of AHRQ and HHS.  This APA program is vital to AHRQ because it will allow young investigators to continue to conduct important studies relevant to child health services research.  It also is important because significant research findings emerging from studies (e.g., emergency pediatrics, quality of health and healthcare for children, critical care, adolescent medicine, behavior and development, and neonatology) that translate research into practice are being published and disseminated through national health journals.  APA has the expertise and familiarity of child health services research and the understanding of the range of children's health care issues. 

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.106-1 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 05-08-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 should be submitted by 1 Aug 05; FY 07 by 1 Aug 06; FY 08 by 1 Aug 07; FY 09 by 1 Aug 08, and FY 10 by 1 Aug 09.  White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 31 Jan 10, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Motion imagery and conventional imagery both provide visual data sources for intelligence gathering purposes through the use of various exploitation technologies and methodologies that demand high performance and dynamic operations to meet mission tasking and exploitation timelines.  Data formats, sensor type and spectral characteristics are the determining factors that dictate the exploitation technologies that will be required to process the data and extract the information to obtain the mission objectives.  The streaming video data format require different strategies for processing motion imagery over conventional two dimensional imaging sensors, but these sensors also differ with some being active or passive and spectral range of operation that require other processing and exploitation considerations.  Although motion imagery and conventional imagery have differing requirements with respect to the implementation of the processing strategies, the types of processing strategies can be very similar.  These imagery collection systems and the resultant data are exploited by teams of analysts, operational and warfighter personnel.  Exploitation often includes object or target detection, material identification and producing a report.  The goal of this research and development activity is to produce better tools and procedures to support exploitation operations in deriving more accurate and timely information from motion imagery and conventional imagery sources.  Specific areas include: 
 

Ability to ingest, visualize, process, exploit and output imagery products in standard and planned data formats for motion imagery and conventional imagery sources.  These formats shall include evolving new data structure and compression schema standards.

Improved procedures for performing graphics annotation to create embedded non-destructive graphic, symbology and textual layers to accompany motion imagery or conventional image data files in standardized formats.

Object tracking paradigms that provide technologies for continuous real time object tracking of both stationary and moving targets of opportunity.  These technologies shall address the conditions where the target is temporarily obscured by intervening objects or shadows and then reappears.  Tracking shall be accomplished through graphic, text and symbolic overlays and shall also calculate speed and direction parameters for the target.

Enhanced algorithms to perform feature extraction and image segmentation.  These algorithms are required to provide enclosed line segment boundaries outlining targets and objects of interest in order to compute statistics for characterizing the feature's shape, size, material content and other identifying information for pattern recognition purposes and to support object tracking paradigms.

Optimized techniques for analysts to produce coherent change detection and two color multi-view products from synthetic aperture radar sources.

Refined spectral analysis capabilities to perform anomaly detection, surface material identification, atmospheric correction and the use of common signature libraries for multispectral and hyperspectral sensors.

Two-dimensional/three-dimensional visualization capabilities to support the presentation of multiple intelligence data sources, including motion imagery (e.g., visible, IR, etc.), imagery, maps, elevation data, text, graphics and symbology, in a common geospatial reference for exploitation purposes.
 

Effective methodologies for deriving accurate geo-positioning information and performing precise mensuration in which operations span the use of diverse data sets and evolving concepts such as smart images.

Software design and development strategies that follow accepted standards and provide intuitive motion imagery and conventional imagery exploitation tools for the analyst and implement and support Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) oriented scenario concepts such as publish and subscribe mechanisms.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a modification for the effort required to support integration of the Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) into the Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR) as well as integration of the SAASM-capable AUR into the Tomahawk Weapon System (TWS).  Incorporation of SAASM into Tomahawk Block IV missiles requires a redesign of the digital electronics in the missile’s Anti-jam Global Positioning System (GPS) Receiver (AGR) and the requisite integration and testing of the redesigned AGR to ensure it still meets AUR requirements.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Systems Company (RSC), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Since 1994, RSC has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the Tomahawk AUR.  RSC solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tactical Tomahawk missile.  RSC currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents of the TWS.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tactical Tomahawk missile is required to perform this effort, RSC is the only source capable of providing the design, integration, test support and analysis necessary to incorpoate SAASM into the Tomahawk Block IV missile in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS, PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR SUBPART 12.6 – STREAMLINED PROCEDUES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS – AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTATIONS ARE HEREBY REQUESTED AND NO FURTHER WRITTEN SOLITATIONS WILL BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS FOR FIRM FIXED PRICE QUOTATIONS. The Solicitation Number is NE-EK0000-5-00274.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition
Circular 2001-23. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541618.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Services (NESDIS), Requirements, Planning and System Integration Program (RPSI), has a requirement for studies to be produced developing business and technical approaches and preliminary prices for best-value-to-the-government solutions for current requirements of multiple government agencies.

BEST VALUE SOLUTIONS FOR SOLAR WIND AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS REQUIREMENTS

Introduction: Studies conducted over several years have demonstrated that several government agencies have requirements that could or must be met in earth-Lagrange 1 (L1) or Artificial Lagrange Orbits.  (See Attachment F) These requirements include acquisition of solar wind data, and telecommunications access to the Earth’s South Pole, and to the National Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) satellites.   NOAA, the National Science Foundation (NSF) , and the Integrated Program Office (IPO) are issuing this joint Broad Agency Announcement in the belief that many of these requirements can be met with a common architecture with resultant economies for all customers.  Other studies have indicated that a commercial solution may offer additional economies. We are particularly interested in commercial solutions that would allow us to buy our needed data and telecom services in a manner similar to current commercial communications services.  

Purpose:  
Task I.  To produce studies developing business and technical approaches and preliminary prices for best-value-to-the-government solutions for current requirements of multiple government agencies.   Responders have broad latitude in proposing solutions that may cover a range of strategies from a government owned satellite system to the commercial satellite provision of data and telecom services, or any other strategy that meets the requirements referenced herein. The government intends to award multiple study contracts in 2005 for up to $300,000.  

Task II. To develop innovative concepts for meeting some or all of NOAA’s requirements for Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) Imagery.  The government may award multiple study contracts up $100,000.

Responders may submit proposals for either #1 or #2 or both. 

Intent and Schedule:  Input from these studies will be used to guide the government in the strategy it employs to satisfy the requirements referenced herein.  Preliminary funding for a solar wind data acquisition might begin as early as 2008.  Proposals are sought from responders who legally eligible to be providers of the services that are the subject of this BAA.

Responders should be aware of a relevant program under consideration at NASA:

 NASA’s Centennial Challenges Program has announced a Partnership Opportunity that includes prizes for stationkeeping solar sail missions.   The government’s choice for solution of the requirements referenced in this BAA might include commercial services from an orbit that requires solar sail propulsion.  In that case, the government might include in its consideration for contract award any results from possible solar sail prizes awarded under NASA’s Centennial Challenges program.    Parties interested in competing for any Centennial Challenges solar sail prizes are advised to monitor the Centennial Challenges web site at www.CentennialChallenges.nasa.gov for further information.

Business Models for Requirement Solutions:  Develop a business model, preliminary costs, and supporting technical and architectural designs for meeting any or all of the current agency requirements listed herein. Business models should be supported with the fullest possible level of detail.  Responders are encouraged to include corporate plans, statement of assets, and any other relevant information.  Proposals may include any reasonable assumptions regarding ground systems for data reception and relay, and for satellite command and control e.g. commercially provided ground facilities, government owned facilities, commercial use of government assets etc.  However all cost assumptions must be clearly specified.  

Additional Customer Requirements:  Proposals to this BAA should be developed primarily for the Current Requirements referenced herein.  However responders may choose to propose a business model that includes additional customers, either commercial or other government requirements.  For instance, NOAA and NASA have been jointly considering architectures that meet NOAA’s requirements and provide communication and/or navigation services to the Earth and/or Moon to meet a portion of NASA’s future Space Exploration and Science needs.  The market research supporting the inclusion of any additional customers’ requirements should be included.


I.	Current Agency Requirements:

1. NOAA   Solar Wind Data Requirement:  NOAA operates the Space Environment Center in Boulder, CO, which has a requirement for specified solar wind measurements every minute from a defined area of space.  Responders are asked to provide yearly costs for provision of such service, and to propose any length of contract that provides best value to the government.  All solar wind measurement requirements must be met by any proposed solution.

Solar Wind Measurements:  Attachment A
Solar Wind Measurement Location:  Attachment B

2. NSF Telecommunications Service Requirements:  
The National Science Foundation manages United States Research Programs in Antarctica.  NSF is facing an acute data communications problem with regards to its rapidly growing scientific base at the South Pole.  Attachment C contains a Request for Information advertised in Commerce Business Daily in 1999 summarizing this deficit.  Responses to the 1999 RFI have not resulted in a solution of the problem listed therein.

NSF would optimally prefer to have a continuous (24-hr/day) Internet capability with data rates in excess of 50Mbps for interconnection to the U.S. Next Generation Internet infrastructure.  There is a growth potential to 100 GB/day in the post 2010 timeframe.
Cost is additionally a major concern, with a desire to remain within or better than current government rates from commercial service. 

Responders are encouraged to consider whether all or a portion of the NSF requirement could be satisfied in a logical and cost effective manner from a platform that is also monitoring solar wind data.  You may suggest any trade or number of trades between current South Pole ground assets and/or changes to South Pole assets, and the communication subsystem on the solar wind platform.  You should propose end-to-end service that delivers the data to Raytheon Polar Services Company in Centennial, CO.  

Responders should assume that uplink and downlink capability from a solar wind platform would have been demonstrated prior to contract service.  They should develop costs and a business approach for yearly prices for contracts of whatever length provides best value to the government. 

3.  Integrated Program Office (IPO) Telecommunications and Observations Service Requirements:  

a.  Telecommunications - The Integrated Program Office manages the procurement of the National Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS).  This satellite series will perform environmental monitoring for a joint NOAA/USAF program.   Its current proposed ground system architecture consists of 15 ground sites (Safetynet Attachment D) linked mainly by fiber connections with limited commercial communication satellite relay.  Earlier studies have indicated that the NPOESS High Rate Data (HRD), approximately 17 Mbps per satellite, could be cross-linked through two satellites placed out of the ecliptic, north and south, and such a strategy could result in large gross savings through the closure of most of the Safetynet ground sites, as well as an improved data latency for the NPOESS system.  

Responders are invited to further develop this concept in light of the potential opportunity presented by a solar wind platform.  Responders may propose any practical solution for the data cross-link between the solar wind platform and the NPOESS satellites.  
Responders should develop a scenario under which the cross-link capability is demonstrated; and then used in a secondary, back up mode to the baseline RF downlink on NPOESS satellites C1-3.  NPOESS C4-6 would use the solar wind platform cross-link as their primary data relay, while keeping their RF system for backup.  Responders may also suggest other transition schedules if merited.

b. Observations - NPOESS will also carry a suite of sensors that will allow the production of a set of Environmental Data Records (EDRs) defined in the Integrated Operational Requirements Document (IORD).  Several studies have examined the desirability of meeting EDR requirements in an orbit similar to the proposed solar wind platform. (See Relevant Studies at end of document.)  Responders are invited to assess the IORD and identify any NPOESS EDRs that could be met with at better-value-for-the-government from the solar wind platform.

Costs and business approach should be developed for:
      1.   The cross-link experiment between an NPOESS satellite and the solar wind platform
2.	A programmatic scenario for transitioning the NPOESS data relay system toward cross-linking data through the solar wind platform while diminishing reliance on the Safetynet ground sites.  
3.	NPOESS EDRs to be delivered from the solar wind platform


OPTIONAL REQUIREMENT

Task II. NOAA Coronal Mass Ejection Imagery:  NOAA has a requirement to track the progress of Coronal Mass Ejections as they transit from the sun.  Our prior assumed technical solution used a telescope with an occulting disk (coronagraph), mounted on the solar platform of the GOES satellites.  Some preliminary results have also recently been reported using the technique of all-sky imaging on the SMEI satellite.  A preliminary assessment has also suggested that it might be possible to meet some portion of the NOAA requirement for CME imaging by upgrading imagers flown on a solar wind platform for other purposes.  

We are interested in what new technical approaches might meet our requirements on any space platform.  We are also interested in innovative solutions that could meet some or all of our requirements from the solar wind platform if that is a good value solution.  Cost and mass are significant considerations.  Our requirements are reflected in Attachment E1 and E2.

SERVICE RELIABILITY

In general government services are required at be continuous and reliable at the 96-98% level with no breaks in service longer than 15 minutes tolerated.  We recognize both the novelty and complexity of providing operational services from a station located at as great a distance as the L1 orbit. Therefore in the development of costs we request that two sets (or more if desired) of cost figures be presented:
a.	The best value solution cost to the government and the estimated reliability that cost number supports
b.	Any suggested solutions and incentives that could make progress toward the 98% reliability level


DELIVERABLES AND SCHEDULE

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration, Integrated Computing Environment-Mainframe And Network (ICE-MAN) Program Management Office (PMO) officials are in the process of determining requirements for a follow-on to Reimbursable Agreement DTFA01-97-C-00026.  However, as a result of inconsistency in customer base and continued decline of platform utilization, the ICE-MAN PMO cannot currently and adequately size its requirement for a planned competitive follow-on, and is uncertain whether a requirement will exist at all.  For reasons discussed above, the PMO plans to extend the agreement performance end date (September 30, 2005) an additional six months to March 2006 with the incumbent source.  This extension will further accommodate procurement planning already in progress.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>The response closing date for this previously posted Sources Sought has been changed to 8 July 2005. The Sources Sought synopsis is provided as follows: The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC PC) at Panama City, Fl, is requesting information from industry for approaches in developing the concept in this Request For Information (RFI).   The U.S. Navy is in the process of determining the future of Unmanned Vehicle communications. This effort is being lead by the Joint Unmanned Systems Common Control (JUSC2) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) at NSWC Panama City and supported by SPAWAR Systems Center San Diego. The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Advanced Systems and Concepts (DUSD – AS&C) sponsors the JUSC2 ACTD.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center – Panama City (NSWC-PC) is the technical manager, PEO Littoral and Mine Warfare, PMS-420, is the transition manger, and the U.S. Joint Forces Command is the operational manager. The JUSC2 ACTD has been tasked with developing a system for controlling multiple unmanned vehicles. The main thrust of this work includes designing and implementing a command and control system that can accept vehicle status and sensor information from a wide array of unmanned vehicles and present the information in a coherent and useful manner to operators.  One issue identified in this concept of common vehicle control is a communications system that will allow multiple unmanned vehicles to operate without interference in a common operating area.  Some of the key requirements for the communications system include: mobile ad-hoc connectivity, effective quality of service provisions, support for user data in IPv4 and/or IPv6 datagrams, a system for network status and control, and extended range support through relays.  To that end, the ACTD is working on an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) paper for an unmanned vehicle communications system that will support multiple dissimilar unmanned vehicles. The concepts outlined in the AoA are to be investigated further for application to real world capabilities of current communications systems.   This RFI is the beginning of an effort to evaluate the capability of current commercially available technology to support the ACTD demonstration. The ACTD will demonstrate a Line-of-Sight (LOS) networked communication system that is capable of supporting up to twelve unmanned surface, subsurface, and air vehicles. Not only must the basic RF connectivity be demonstrated, there will be an actively changing, mobile ad-hoc network with variable data rates, latencies, and numbers of active nodes. This is a sources sought announcement only and is not a solicitation or Broad Agency Announcement.  A solicitation will not be issued as a result of this announcement.  If a solicitation is developed after consideration of all information received, it will be advertised in the Government Point of Entry (GPE).  Responses to this announcement should be sent to the address stated below not later than 30 days after posting.  Responders should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Mailing address for submissions is:  Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Code XPS1, Attn: Mark Ross, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL. 32407-7001.  Technical questions should be directed to Mr. Joseph Krajn! ak at (850) 235-5293 or email joseph.krajnak@navy.mil.

SUBJECT

This document is a Request for Information (RFI) about available Insider Threat Solutions to protect the DoD from those who conduct malicious activity against or across the network, system or data.  

Responses to this RFI are due NLT Tuesday, June 21, 2005, at 5:00PM Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) (GMT-4). 

 
DESCRIPTION

The Defense Information System Agency (DISA) in support of the Computer Network Defense (CND) mission established by the United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) is seeking information from industry, academia, and government that will assist in the deployment of a software product solution to assists in elevating the CND posture of the Department of Defense (DOD) computer network systems.

The current solution to our computer network environment currently provides inadequate protective measures:

Individual Host and Network-based protective mechanisms do not provide real time protection from malicious insider attack behavior.

Transformational technology provides hope but not proven concepts for deployment.


The DISA is in search of product solution that can address the requirements below for possible further evaluation.

REQUIRED CAPABILITIES

This section describes the high-level capabilities for the Insider Threat Toolset.

Protect against system compromise: 

1.  Prevent malicious code insertion, system modification, vulnerability exploitation, content manipulation, and deceptive content. 
a. Malicious code insertion involves prevention of virus-bearing portable/removable media, the execution of mobile code, and the insertion of malicious code.  
b. Prevent and protect systems, servers and network devices from implementation of untrusted patches; resource reallocation and/or redirection; and modifications to software files by other than system administrators.  
c. Track all critical system component modifications, protecting against administrator account lockout, and monitoring access and changes to
d. Protect against replay attacks, zero-day exploits, the use of covert channels, and the installation or use of steganographic tools.

2. Prevent unauthorized configuration changes, and monitor internal e-mail events
a. Prevent the manipulation of content including unauthorized workflow changes that enable product modifications or modification of data.
b. Prevent and protect against ignorant manipulation, strategic information manipulation, and deleting/withholding content from reports upon inception. 
3. Protect against the accessing of unauthorized files and information including the prevention of unauthorized use or misuse, hacking exploits, transitive trust exploitation, and spoofing.
a. Prevent unauthorized use/misuse and hacking exploitation using replay attacks that retransmit valid data.
b. Prevent and protect against unauthorized use and/or misuse of files/information. 
c. Implement a data tagging/classification system.
4. Minimize exposure time of un-patched systems.
5. Prevent the use of keystroke loggers and steganographic tools.
6. Implement sandbox technology to enforce policy requirements regarding protection of system resources.
7. Prevent covert channel use, internal e-mail attacks, telephone taps, and protect against database adjustments.
8. Prevent transitive trust exploitation by protecting data integrity, stopping exploitation of collaboration tools, and protecting against workflow changes to include or exclude other 
analysts (dissemination).
9. Prevent spoofing and protect against using assets to collect information that benefits an unauthorized party.
10. Prevent exfiltration of data/information by using hard media, copying to removable media, and by electronic means via a network.
a. Protect against unauthorized broadcasting or transmitting devices in classified areas or meetings and disallowing telephone tap recording. 
b. Prevent electronic exfiltration of data/information via network means by preventing the exploitation of web conferencing capabilities, along with the cutting and pasting of data between classification levels (high to low), and the usage of cameras to shoulder surf.
11. Prevent and protect against RF transmissions, in and around local facilities.  

Detect a potential insider threat

1. Detect the introduction of malicious code and usage of cellular and wireless data devices.
2. Create a comprehensive list of system and user behavior attributes that can be monitored to establish normal and abnormal patterns enabling anomaly and misuse detection.
3. Use of network mapping tools to detect alterations in the configuration of a network along with scanning and analyzing system and network audit logs to detect anomalous system and inside activity.
4. Monitor system and application logs using a structured monitoring approach
5. Check file and access permissions within the system(s) to flag potential problem areas.

Question: The requirements for our response (topics to be addressed, details to be provided,  page limitation, etc.). Is any additional information required, other than the hourly rate and the completed Representations, Certifications, and Provisions? Should our firm's proposal address primarily the five bullet points included in the Statement of Work's Requirements section? Should we  include references as part of our technical proposal? In addition to the completed RFQ and Representations and Certifications, what is the maximum number of pages of narrative that can accompany our proposal?  Does this include attachments such as company information, resumes, bios, figures,  etc.? Answer: " It is incumbent upon each prospective contractor to address each of the requirements listed in the attached Statement of Work. " There is not a set format for contractor responses. The topics to be addressed and the details to be provided are at the contractor's discretion. There  is no page limit, but contractors should keep submissions to a minimum and include only relevant information. Extraneous content, determined by the C.O. as not related to this requirement, shall be omitted from evaluation. Pertinent attachments (mainly resumes) will be allowed and evaluated. The  prospective vendor should include information that is relevant and will assist the evaluation panel in making a selection. 2. Question:  The evaluation factors that will be used to determine the awardees. Answer: " Each submission will be evaluated on the responses received in response to the  RFQ and the Statement of Work. " - Contractor responses will be evaluated on the content of the response and the manner in which the SOW requirements have been addressed. The Government will make award to the responsible offeror(s) whose submission conforms to the SOW and is most advantageous to  the Government in their cost and technical response. Please refer to the clause in the RFQ - Evaluation Factors for Award. 3. Question: Is there a specific electronic format required (Word, PDF, WordPerfect)? When we submit the proposal electronically, would you prefer to receive the proposal in  a Microsoft Word document or a PDF format? Answer: PDF format is suggested, but any of the three formats are acceptable. 4. Question: Are there any restrictions on where a company is physically located that can bid on this requirement? Answer:  There are no geographical restrictions for  performance of this requirement. 5. Question: Would the Contractor be considered responsive if we provide several rates (i.e., rates for different professional levels (PL))? Should a Supplemental Rate sheet be included or can the Hourly Rates of the individuals be included on the completed  RFQ? Answer: The Government will accept a performance-based proposal, which provides the option of several labor categories with corresponding labor rates. You must also include in your submission, the base labor rate for writing and editing services. You will not be found unresponsive if you also  include labor rates for additional labor categories that you feel will also benefit the Government. Please submit in writing how you feel this approach will benefit the Government. All rates shall be included on the RFQ. 6. Question:  In submitting a quotation, do we simply have to enter an  hourly rate on the SF 18, since there is no quantity of hours to be extended? Are their specific federal forms (GSA Forms or SF forms) that are to be included? If so, which one[s]? Answer: An hourly rate is the only price evaluation that will be performed. You are required to send the SF18  (Request for Quotation) with your proposed cost per hour. Make sure you fill out your information in Boxes 8, 13, 14, 15, and 16. 7. Question:  Since this is a three-year BPA, is there an opportunity to increase the hourly rate in Years 2 and 3, or is one rate to be bid for all three  years? Answer: The government prefers one fully loaded rate for all three years, since there are no option periods to be exercised. The rate will remain constant for the three-year period. 8.  Question: Can our quotation be delivered to the Durham, NC location via fax, and if so, what is the fax  number? Answer: Submissions for this requirement should be sent via e-mail to the Contracting officer.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-LCACSS050503
<RESPDATE>051805
<CONTACT>Greg Dougherty, Contract Specialist, Phone 407-380-8419, Fax 407-380-8399, Email gregory.dougherty@navy.mil
<DESC>The Department of the Navy is seeking potential sources with the ability to produce Service Life Extention Program (SLEP) Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Maintenance Training Courseware (curriculum, hardware, software, and training devices) that will be used for instructing students in the functionality, operation and maintenance of the SLEP LCAC systems in normal and casualty modes of operation.  Providing instructors is not a requirement.  This courseware will be a synthesis of existing LCAC legacy training and differences resulting from the implementation of an LCAC SLEP program.  It is estimated that 50% of the courses are changed as a result of the SLEP.

The SLEP LCAC Maintenance Training Courseware must provide a  predetermined (Government specified) blended solution approach (instructor led and alternative technology based instruction) to preventive and corrective action maintenance training to include instructions in troubleshooting and fault isolation procedures and techniques, parts removal and replacement, repairs (to the lowest repairable unit), and verification of corrective actions.  Predetermined numbers and types of training devices must be produced to reinforce student learning and enable students to perform preventive and corrective maintenance tasks directly correlated with maintenance course objectives. Through the use of the appropriate LCAC Operational and Maintenance Technical Manuals and Drawings, and simulated (virtual) and actual tools and test equipment, the SLEP LCAC Maintenance Training Courseware shall provide training at the system, subsystem and component levels.  Simulated interactions with SLEP LCAC on line and off line diagnostics programs and accurate simulation of operational symptoms as a result of instructor induced simulated faults are essential requirements of the SLEP LCAC Maintenance Training Courseware.  

Written responses to this announcement should consist of the following: 1) A submission of your firm’s detailed capabilities to meet the requirements listed above, 2) Your firm’s degree of familiarity with: a) the SLEP LCAC Program, b) the SLEP LCAC Technical Manuals and Drawings, c) the SLEP LCAC Operational and Diagnostic Software, and d) the VELCAC Trainer Software; 3) A discussion of any customary business practices that might affect the firm's fulfillment of the requirement or its relationship with the Navy customer; and 4) A statement as to whether the firm responding to this announcement is a small business for the NAICS code that pertains to the product being offered. A set aside decision will be made based on submission of this data.

This announcement is published for informational purposes only. It does not constitute a solicitation and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement.

It is requested that written responses be submitted as an attached Microsoft Word document, limited to three pages, via Email, and in time to be received by 1:00pm Eastern Standard Time on 18 May 2005.

Emails should be addressed to:

There are no other prescribed format requirements for the response to this announcement.

All firms responding to this announcement will be notified if a requirement is solicited. Small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women owned small business concerns are encouraged to submit responses to this announcement. 

The Department of the Navy will use the responses to the announcement to make an informed decision concerning the strategy it will pursue to meet its objectives and, if the Department of the Navy elects to proceed with a procurement, to structure the solicitation to maximize commercial sector interest and encourage truly innovative and imaginative proposals.

Questions/Answers

1.	What is the difference between hardware and training devices?

Training devices can be anything from a deck of cards for recognition, to a Full Mission Trainer.  The significant difference is that training devices (as we in the Navy identify them) are inducted into the Cog 2”O” inventory.  Hardware is something you can hand me, that I can measure with a ruler, or a weight scale.

2.	What company is doing the Media Analysis?

The Media Analysis will be Government owned information and will be made available for this requirement.


3.	What is VELCAC?

Virtual Environment LCAC (Landing Craft Air Cushion).

4.	Will we accept teaming arrangements as capabilities?

Capabilities submitted for this requirement should state the capabilities of the Prime contractor for the work.

5.	The current courseware. When was it developed? By whom? What tool was it developed in?

Textron Marine developed the original courseware in the 1980’s.  In the early 1990’s, TSM Corporation made major revisions to the courseware. Courseware was developed under MIL-STD 1379B using WordPerfect software.

<DESC>POC:  Tangee Brookie, U. S. Geological Survey, P. O. Box 25046, MS-204A, Denver, CO 80225, e-mail:  tbrookie@usgs.gov.  The U. S. Geological Survey, Iowa Water Science Center has a need for a custom-built mobile water-quality laboratory built upon a Dodge Sprinter 3500 158" wheelbase cab and chassis.  (Contractor is to provide above-referenced Dodge Sprinter 3500.)  The minimum requirements for the mobile laboratory are based upon the site acessibility restrictions in the field and access height restrictions in the underground entrance to the Center water-quality laboratory facility in Iowa City, and working accessibility restrictions within the laboratory section of the vehicle.  Those minimum requirements are a maximum vehicle length of 264 inches, maximum vehicle height of 108 inches (clearance), maximum vehicle width of 96 inches, a minimum payload capacity of 4600 pounds, and a minimum of 78" head clearance within the laboratory section of the vehicle.  The Dodge Sprinter is currently the only available vehicle that has a low enough chassis profile and large enough payload capacity to meet the exterior and interior accessibility requirements.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with with 41 U.S.C. 253(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the services specified as a sole source from Faber Speciality Vehicles, 7052 Americana Parkway, Columbus, OH 43068, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required custom-built mobile water-quality laboratory built upon a Dodge Sprinter 3500 158" wheelbase cab and chassis are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

NOTE: This information is for market research only. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), solicitation, or an indication that the government will contract for this requirement. The government will not pay for information received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.
1. Summary:
AETC/DO is considering purchasing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) ground-based spatial disorientation countermeasure trainers, termed the Advanced Spatial Awareness Trainer (ASAT). The ASAT must be capable of providing spatial disorientation (SD) illusions of both the vestibular and visual nature. Additionally, the ASAT must be capable of providing 1) routine flight simulation with momentary accelerations in the traditional six degrees of freedom (pitch, roll, yaw, heave, surge and sway) and 2) display a visual scene of at least 100 degrees horizontal and 40 degrees vertical.
2. Pre-proposal Conference and Site Visit:
A pre-proposal conference and site visit will be held after the request for proposal (RFP) is issued.
3. Pricing:
Responding vendors are requested to provide pricing data on additional pre-priced options that exceed this baseline performance specification.
4. Warranty Information:
Vendors should supply overall warranty information on their ASAT devices, parts, subassemblies, and subcomponents including parts warranted by individual manufacturers. Any expected annual maintenance costs, and any anticipated computer upgrades should also be included.
5. Basic Method of Acquisition:
AETC’s intent is open to either purchasing or leasing the device(s). We are looking to acquire a total of 6 devices as funding becomes available. It is anticipated that the follow-on purchases will take place about one year from the acceptance of the first device.
6. Governing Product Directives:
No specific MILSPEC Standards apply to this purchase, but it is anticipated that vendors should be able to show the government that similar devices have met some type of FAA flight simulator standards.
7. Specific Mandatory Specifications/Requirements/Capabilities:
a. Cab or Cockpit Configuration:
1) Cockpit Size: Any pilot candidate in the Joint Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (JSUPT) program must be able to sit comfortably in the cockpit. In other words, if the person is of an anthropometric size to enter pilot training, then that person must be able to fit just like they would fit in the actual USAF T-6 Texan II aircraft. 
2) Seat and rudder pedals: The seat should be adjustable in forward-backward and up-down directions. It is highly desirable for the rudder pedals to be adjustable as well (forward-backward), and include the traditional aircraft toe-brake feature.
3) The cab must be light tight to produce the auto kinesis illusion. It must also contain adjustable background lighting and/or adjustable flood lights. When needed, the entire cockpit must be able to remove any background lighting, i.e. display screens must look as if they are turned off.
4) Instrumentation or head-down displays must reflect the same instrument arrangement as the T-6A aircraft, as much as possible. When this requirement cannot be met, the vendor will inform the program manager for written acceptance of the deviation. Photos of the T-6A instrument panel are attached. 
5) It is desirable that several of the instruments have interactive capability; e.g. an adjustable altimeter for changes in barometric pressure altitude, an adjustable airspeed set marker, a course set knob, and a heading set knob, etc. Standard flight simulation navigation (including instrument approaches and en-route navigation) and communication (UHF/VHF) capabilities are required.
6) Out-the-window (OTW) viewing scene: This feature is critical when producing visual illusions. It is also very important when producing flight realism. The OTW viewing scene of the virtual world must be at least 100 degrees horizontal and at least 40 degrees vertical--as measured from the eyes of the pilot when their head is in the normal sitting flight position. Larger is preferred. The scene itself must be of a high enough resolution so that it doesn't appear to be "jumpy" or partially rendered.
7) Headset: A functional, adjustable standard headset must be incorporated in the cab. Constant communication to the console operator is a requirement. Communication should be free of distortion and background noise. The console operator must be able to cut all verbal communications to the cockpit with one keystroke action.
8) Camera: An infrared camera for observing the pilot in the cab is required.
9) Night-Vision Goggle (NVG) compatibility:  A desirable feature is that of being able to use a NVG when flying the ASAT.
b. Motion Platform
1) The motion platform must be able to produce six degrees of freedom (DoF) motion--pitch, bank, yaw, heave, surge and sway. Pitch motion must be at least +/- 20 degrees from level. Bank must be at least +/- 20 degrees, and yaw must be capable of sustaining constant rotation in either direction without any limits. Total linear displacement, except heave, is not specified but the ASAT is required to produce momentary accelerations in the linear displacement directions of surge, sway and heave. These are minimum acceptable criteria.
2) Standard 220 AC (3 phase) electrical requirements are recommended, but if more (or unique power) is required, please specify in your proposal. (E.g. Line conditioning, clean power)
3) Sub-threshold motion in pitch, roll and yaw is required.
4) Facility environmental restrictions should be defined by vendor (Air conditioning, temperature limits, air flow requirements, etc)

Degree of Freedom	DisplacementRequirement	VelocityRequirement	AccelerationRequirement
Pitch	+/- 20 °	0.5 – 20 °/sec	0.5 – 60 °/sec²
Roll	+/- 20 °	0.5 – 20 °/sec	0.5 – 60 °/sec²
Yaw	Continuous	0.5 – 120 °/sec	0.5 – 10 °/sec²
Heave (if provided)	+/- 10 cm	0.5 – 40 cm/sec	Acceptable turbulence characteristics
Surge	Not specified	Not specified	Not specified
Sway	Not specified 	Not specified	Not specified
TABLE I. Motion Requirements
c. Console (workstation)
1) Color monitors for all displays at the workstation are required. The total number of displays is not specified, and the display surfaces should be shielded from overhead lights.
2) The graphical user interface should contain multiple features. Control of the imagery is critical. Features like time-of-day, in-flight visibility and associated changes of in-flight visibility (fog conditions, ceilings, in and out of cloud effects), and adjustment of runway dimensions (width/length) and sloping are all necessary. In addition, individual pre-programming of the motion is required, and pre-programming of many of the visual features should also be available. It is absolutely critical to allow for “conditional” events to occur. Conditional events are those motion and visual changes which happen at pre-determined points in space, or at a specified run time in the simulator space-time world. This important feature will be discussed further during the site visit.
3) Simulated flight and changes in the cockpit instrumentation must be controlled at the workstation. The console operator can demonstrate the flight characteristics without getting in the cab, and that any and all of the flight instruments have a feature where they can be frozen, blanked, or removed at the wish of the same console operator. These features must also be tied into the conditional event feature. The console operator must be able to either freeze an instrument whenever they desire, or an instrument can be pre-programmed to do the same thing when a conditional event is reached.
4) The console operator must be able to move the aircraft throughout the database in the traditional three dimensions (latitude, longitude, and altitude) with the aid of a cursor. Instantaneous altitude changes are also requested.
5) Recording of the total simulator profile is desired, but not required. However, the capability to display, record, and print a portion of the profile, like the ILS approach is required (in both glide slope and localizer). Please provide a list of cost options for various levels of recording capabilities.
d. Specialized Features
1) The ASAT must be able to generate acceptable SD illusions of both vestibular or visual origins and combinations of both sensory types. Acceptable illusions will be decided by the government.
2) The workstation must be able to generate formation profiles so the operator in the cab can fly with the virtual lead aircraft. Simulated air refueling is also a desired feature. So a pre-programmed tanker should be included in the data base.
3) Although the distributed mission training concept (i.e., linking several devices together via the WAN/LAN) is not a requirement, AETC would like to know about the cost of this technology.
8. Vendor Solution:
Interested vendors should propose their best solution for the above requirements and features. Because there are no specific military standards for such a device, we are hoping to work with the potential vendors to make sure they understand the different levels of importance of the listed requirements. Not all features may be required in the final product, but knowing more about the capabilities is important to the final product. We would like to better understand the vendor’s capabilities and options for both flight simulation and SD illusions. Supportability/ maintainability/reliability parameters and maintenance concepts are to be included in the proposal. First level maintenance will be done by Air Force personnel; vendors should define follow on maintenance options, e.g. on-site, on-call, etc. The requirements mentioned in this document are intended as threshold minimums. Options can be priced separately.
9. Technical Manuals, Operator and Maintenance Training
The Government will request that offerors include all applicable technical manuals and one week of on-site operations and maintenance training at Randolph AFB, TX upon delivery of the first device. Any additional training needed at the vendor’s factory, or third party site, should be mentioned in the response to the RFI. The intent is that the vendor delivers a fully functional commercial-off-the-shelf Advanced Spatial Awareness Trainer (ASAT) system. It is incumbent that the vendor identify to AETC the training plan recommendations and typical costs for that training in the response to this RFI.
10. Location/Operation Parameters:
This first device will be operated/maintained at Randolph AFB, TX by the 12th ADS. Subsequent devices will be shipped as specified by the AETC program manager.
11. Definitions:
a. Spatial Disorientation Countermeasure Trainers – a ground-based device capable of producing visual and vestibular illusions, while at the same time producing motion sensations typical of a flight simulator. Several of the specific illusions are spelled out in text Spatial Disorientation in Aviation, published by AIAA, 2004. Continual yaw motion is critical. Details will be provided if requested.
b. Flight Simulator – a ground-based device capable of producing flight simulation sensations of both motion and visual specifications. Those specifications may vary and it is recommended that vendors interested in this RFI review practices used by the FAA when certifying the motion and visual characteristics of a flight simulator. Cab motion and visual scene motion should be instantaneous, while the difference between stick inputs and cab motion should be less than 150 milliseconds. Less is better.
c. NVG capability – Using an NVG while in the flight mode is desired. The pilot should be able to look through the intensification tube when viewing the outside world and see a realistic NVG image, and look underneath the tubes while looking at and seeing the cockpit instrumentation.
12. Contracting Officer Data:
It is the Government’s intention to award to ONE contractor. All interested business concerns shall indicate interest in this acquisition by providing the company name, capabilities stated above, mailing address, phone number, and electronic mail address to the Contracting Officer. All responses must be sent to Jerry Strubbe AND Debbie Aguirre at AETC/CONS.

In addition to any pricing data submitted as a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM), Vendor Catalogs and/or Price lists, it is requested that potential offerors provide sufficient written information supporting their capability to provide the commodity requested. This information should, as a minimum, include (a) degree of experience in SD trainer development, and (b) provide past corporate information with commercial and Government contracts with references and points of contact and (c) Vendor Catalogs and/or Price lists. Provide this required information via electronic mail. Perspective bidders must have the financial backing to defray mobilization and operating costs for at least ninety (90) days. Internet and e-mail capabilities are a must! Central Contract Registration (CCR) mandatory.
13. Point(s) of contact:
AETC/CONS – Mr. Jerry Strubbe or Ms. Debbie Aguirre, DSN 487-2122, Comm (210) 652-2122. Email: jerry.strubbe@randolph.af.mil or debbie.aguirre@randolph.af.mil

<DESC>The Department of the Navy is seeking potential sources with the ability to produce Service Life Extention Program (SLEP) Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Maintenance Training Courseware (curriculum, hardware, software, and training devices) that will be used for instructing students in the functionality, operation and maintenance of the SLEP LCAC systems in normal and casualty modes of operation.  Providing instructors is not a requirement.  This courseware will be a synthesis of existing LCAC legacy training and differences resulting from the implementation of an LCAC SLEP program.  It is estimated that 50% of the courses are changed as a result of the SLEP.

The SLEP LCAC Maintenance Training Courseware must provide a  predetermined (Government specified) blended solution approach (instructor led and alternative technology based instruction) to preventive and corrective action maintenance training to include instructions in troubleshooting and fault isolation procedures and techniques, parts removal and replacement, repairs (to the lowest repairable unit), and verification of corrective actions.  Predetermined numbers and types of training devices must be produced to reinforce student learning and enable students to perform preventive and corrective maintenance tasks directly correlated with maintenance course objectives. Through the use of the appropriate LCAC Operational and Maintenance Technical Manuals and Drawings, and simulated (virtual) and actual tools and test equipment, the SLEP LCAC Maintenance Training Courseware shall provide training at the system, subsystem and component levels.  Simulated interactions with SLEP LCAC on line and off line diagnostics programs and accurate simulation of operational symptoms as a result of instructor induced simulated faults are essential requirements of the SLEP LCAC Maintenance Training Courseware.  

Written responses to this announcement should consist of the following: 1) A submission of your firm’s detailed capabilities to meet the requirements listed above, 2) Your firm’s degree of familiarity with: a) the SLEP LCAC Program, b) the SLEP LCAC Technical Manuals and Drawings, c) the SLEP LCAC Operational and Diagnostic Software, and d) the VELCAC Trainer Software; 3) A discussion of any customary business practices that might affect the firm's fulfillment of the requirement or its relationship with the Navy customer; and 4) A statement as to whether the firm responding to this announcement is a small business for the NAICS code that pertains to the product being offered. A set aside decision will be made based on submission of this data.

This announcement is published for informational purposes only. It does not constitute a solicitation and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement.

It is requested that written responses be submitted as an attached Microsoft Word document, limited to three pages, via Email, and in time to be received by 1:00pm Eastern Standard Time on 18 May 2005.

<DESC>U.S.  DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION	

VEHICLE ASSIT AND AUTOMATION SYSTEMS; REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
AGENCIES:  Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and Federal Transit Admin. (FTA) 
ACTION: Notice; Request For Information.
SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) is seeking information for its Vehicle Assist and Automation (VAA) System project. The VAA project may be proposed as a major initiative under the USDOT’s Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) program to improve transportation safety, and enhance mobility and productivity for both transit and commercial vehicle operations.
	The VAA project has been set up to create a comprehensive research and development plan to develop, deploy and commercialize vehicle assist and automation technologies and systems. This initiative is one of many exploratory projects that have been jointly set up by the USDOT’s ITS Program to foster and incubate future research programs. The long-term goal of this initiative is to explore the application of VAA systems to improve mobility and productivity of vehicle operations in varying environments, such as maintenance/port/warehouse facilities and alternative right-of-way situations (e.g., dedicated lanes, narrow lanes and shoulders).
	Currently, the VAA project is focused upon four applications of VAA systems in the transit industry: precision docking, vehicle guidance, platooning (or electronic coupling of vehicles) and automated vehicle operations. The application of these four systems has been detailed by way of eight operating scenarios presented in Appendix A. Additional information regarding these operating scenarios (and any other scenarios that you wish to propose) and the use of these systems within commercial vehicle operations is requested. 
	For more information on the VAA project, please refer to the Vehicle Assist and Automation System for Transit Operations research documents available at www.its.dot.gov.
OBJECTIVE:
		The objective of this RFI is to seek broad stakeholder input and interest on the application of VAA system within the transit and commercial vehicle industry, identify potential impacts and benefits of using the VAA systems, and gather information on tried, existing, and potential VAA system operations strategies. The information will assist the USDOT in identifying some of the barriers to deploying VAA systems, and will support the development of a VAA program. The USDOT may select various innovative and pioneering VAA operations strategies for further study. Moreover, entities (public agencies, private sector companies, and other organizations) associated with the selected VAA operations strategies may be asked to provide continued stakeholder input in the development of the VAA program. 
DATES: Responses to this announcement should be submitted on or before  August  3, 2005. See the "Supplementary Information" section for electronic access and filing addresses.
 NOTE: This is neither a Request For Proposals nor an Invitation For Bids.
POINTS OF CONTACT: Mr.Venkat  Pindiprolu, (202) 366-8061 and Mr. Brian Cronin
(202) 366-4881.  They are located at the United States Department of Transportation,  FTA,

APPENDIX A
VEHICLE ASSIST AND AUTOMATION SYSTEMS 
FOR TRANSIT OPERATIONS OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS

Maintenance Operations
A bus maintenance yard performs the daily functions of fueling and washing the buses, as well as performing routine maintenance and taking buses out of service for more extensive repairs.  Depending upon the size and complexity of the operations, lining up buses in the order that they are to be used the following day can also be a complex and time-consuming task.

All four components of VAA could be applied to this aspect of operations.  

§	Precision Docking could be used to guide buses into refueling, washing, and maintenance bays and parking spaces

§	Vehicle Guidance could be used to “drive” buses through the yard in narrow lanes on precise paths

§	Platooning could be used to guide a linked chain of buses through the bays 

§	Automated Vehicle Operation is technically possible, but may not be operationally appropriate, as some buses will still require human attention for non-routine maintenance.  A fully-automated system would need to divert the buses requiring non-routine maintenance to a special holding area.  Full automation could be used for short journeys between different areas of the maintenance facility.  		

Currently, the operations of the maintenance yard require a number of workers (bus servicers, hostlers, or jockeys) to be available to move buses among the various fueling, cleaning and maintenance functions.  If these operations were assisted or fully automated, the number of workers could be reduced and the employees could be utilized to work on more skilled tasks.  Balanced against the labor savings would be the costs of the infrastructure and vehicle sensors, as well as the costs for maintenance of the automation equipment itself.  The MTA estimates that 12 people at most process 200 buses per night, spending an average of 15-18 minutes per bus.  Similar results were seen at WMATA where 12 people serviced approximately 220 buses in an overnight shift. 
Existing Vehicle Maintenance Facilities
This scenario assumes that the bus fueling through exterior washing functions would be automated through a mechanical system. The refueling would be conducted via a robotic refueling system and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology would be used for data capture and parking management.  
New Vehicle Maintenance Facilities
This scenario assumes that the staging after fare box drop through staging for next day would be automated through a non-mechanical system. The refueling would be conducted via a robotic refueling system and RFID technology would be used for data capture and parking management. 

Suburban Collector
The suburban collector operating scenario is seen as operating in a medium- to low-density environment. These systems would likely include precision docking to better facilitate passenger boarding and alighting. It might offer point-to-point service with relatively few stops, such as an office park shuttle or an airport parking garage shuttle. In this case, due to the nature of the environment, and the likelihood that right-of-way acquisition would not be an issue, vehicle guidance is not analyzed. The collector systems may include platooning, but it isn’t required unless there is sufficient passenger load that headway between vehicles is an issue. A system operating at an amusement park in Japan includes platooning on days when the park has many visitors, but only single vehicles on days when attendance is light.  

VAA-equipped suburban collectors could be used for low-speed operations in gated communities such as retirement centers.  The precision docking technology could be particularly helpful for boarding passengers with physical limitations.  The appropriate size for the vehicle would depend upon ridership demand. This is also the case with the FlexBRT system proposed for Orange County, Florida.  Operational models typically envision relatively fixed routes, or free travel within a small fixed perimeter. 
Urban Circulator
The urban circulator operating scenario is seen as operating in a high density environment, such as downtown circulator systems currently operating in major cities throughout the U.S. Similar systems have been tested in both Europe and Japan not so much for their projected benefits, but as a low risk way to test a new technology.   Currently, the only two systems operating with VAA technologies are one at an amusement park in Japan and a high-density business park in Rotterdam, Netherlands. The system in Japan operates on a private road,  so it did not have to be certified for public roadway use.  Also, it is not by most definitions a public transit system; it is considered in this study because it uses fully automated buses operating in platoons. The Rotterdam system is currently a demonstration.

An urban circulator system would likely operate on some type of dedicated facility either for exclusive use by the circulator system or transit vehicles in general. The use of precision docking would be advantageous to better facilitate boarding and alighting passengers. Vehicle guidance would likely be deployed as well since there would be a dedicated facility. Platooning would only be required if passenger demand is so great that passengers queuing at stations becomes a problem. Automated Vehicle Operations, while demonstrated in both Japan and Netherlands, was not analyzed since both require highly specialized vehicles and typical applications in the U.S. would use either existing vehicles or standard transit buses.

So far, urban circulator systems that have been deployed are more typical of a free “people mover” operation, not public transport. However, urban circulators have been considered in Europe and Japan as part of a public transit system that uses specialized small vehicles (Cybercars in Europe, Crayon in Japan) for short typically fixed commuter routes, such as from a park-and-ride lot to the central city, or from a remote parking lot to a university or office park.  These personal transit operations could be done without automated vehicles. The key issue would be whether these operations themselves, independent of the automated vehicle aspect, would be appropriate for the U.S.

Mixed Flow Lanes
In this scenario, transit buses operate in the same lanes as regular traffic, on limited access highways/interstates, arterials, or local streets.  Mixed flow lane operations are typical of many transit systems in the U.S.  In theory, all four VAA applications could be applied, while in reality, precision docking and vehicle guidance would be the most likely. While in reality, since there is no dedicated right-of-way, only precision docking will be analyzed. For platooning or fully automated guidance to be implemented in mixed flow lanes, all the other vehicles would have to be equipped, which is not likely in the next ten years.

Designated Arterial Lane
In this scenario, transit buses operate on a dedicated lane adjacent to regular traffic primarily on arterials and local streets. More U.S. cities are utilizing designated arterial lanes for transit operations in order to improve transit service. However, many localities are encountering barriers to creating a designated lane due to right-of-way constraints. A benefit of vehicle guidance is the ability to have a smaller lane width thus improving the odds of creating a designated lane in an already crowded environment. In theory, all four VAA applications could be applied, while in reality, precision docking and vehicle guidance would be the most likely. For this operating scenario both VAA applications will be analyzed. Platooning would only be warranted if passenger demand was high enough that queuing at stations and stops became a problem. For automated vehicle operations to be implemented in designated arterial lanes, all the other transit vehicles would have to be equipped, which is not likely to occur.

Narrow Lane/Roadway Shoulder Operations
There are several different options for this scenario, including:
§	Driving on the shoulder
§	Driving in the HOT/HOV lane
§	Building new narrow lanes

Roadway shoulder operations is when a transit agency allows buses to use a roadway shoulder in order to bypass congested areas. Currently, a few transit agencies operate buses in a bus-only lane on the shoulder, although not at full highway speeds. In all instances transit agencies have teamed with the respective DOTs to ensure that the existing roadway shoulder is suitable for buses to operate on. In cases where the current roadway shoulders do not meet the operationally required design minimum, DOTs have made improvements to the roadway shoulder. Normally, buses would only use the roadway shoulder during operating peak periods when congestion is present. Anecdotal evidence has shown that driving buses in these conditions is stressful for drivers.  

Minnesota’s Metro Transit found considerable operating benefits in creating a bus-only shoulder lane without assistance technologies.  Passengers perceived that their trip on the shoulder was 15 minutes faster than driving in mixed traffic, although in reality their trip was only 8 minutes faster.  However, they had significant issues with passengers calling in to the transit center to complain that their bus wasn’t driving on the shoulder or wasn’t driving fast enough.  There were also issues with “jealous motorists” in passenger cars blocking the bus lane or illegally driving in the bus lane. 

Minnesota’s Metro Transit found that although there are no legal restrictions to using roadway shoulders for transit use, only three U.S. transit agencies currently operate this type of service. Also, several jurisdictions in the U.S. are in the process of implementing bus use of shoulder programs.   It appears that VAA applications are needed to effectively realize the congestion reduction and improved service benefits of narrow lane operations.  

There appears to be renewed interest at the Federal Congressional level in High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes, which may be funded in the new transportation authorization.  If that occurs, vehicle guidance would be one way to safely allow buses to join a lane that might otherwise be too narrow for safe operations.  Platooning with mixed traffic in a HOT/HOV lane would be also possible, but unlikely.

Roadway shoulder operations has the same operating characteristics as narrow lane operations.  The operational concept is that the bus operates on a lane that would be too narrow for a driver to operate safely at normal speed, typically a 10 foot wide lane for a 9 foot wide bus .  This allows the agency to deploy a bus-only lane on the existing highway shoulder or an HOV/HOT lane without investing in building new lanes.  If a new lane is required, a narrower lane would require less ROW.

Narrow lane operations might use vehicle guidance/automation combined with side collision warning for merging into/out of bus lanes.  The narrow lane systems tested so far have been vehicle guidance, not automation, except for one demonstration of a fully-automated snowplow in Japan.   There is no technological reason why vehicle automation wouldn’t apply to this operational scenario, but it is perceived as a more futuristic (and hence risky) technology than vehicle guidance.  Also, there is not much additional benefit to doing automated vehicle operation in addition to vehicle guidance for narrow lane operations, unless the bus service is so heavily used that buses need to run at very short headways in bus “platoons” to improve system capacity. (The snowplows were fully automated so that the crew could focus attention on operating the blower machinery, not so that headway could be reduced.)  However, since the Metro Transit survey did show considerable interest in platooning, more research needs to be done as to which of the operational scenarios with platooning would improve transit operations.

This operational scenario is most appropriate for buses that drive on limited-access highways in relatively straight lines, because if there are sharp curves the lane can’t be narrow and permit a 40 foot bus to safely navigate at highway speeds. Vehicle guidance appears to be the most appropriate application subsystem for this scenario at this time, although platooning and vehicle automation would be possible if demand was sufficient that reduced headways between buses (measured in feet, not in minutes) would help increase system capacity. 

At-Grade Transitway
In this scenario transit buses operate on a dedicated transitway where only transit vehicles are operated. The transitway is physically separated from other traffic lanes but is not entirely grade separated. In most instances transit vehicles operating on the transitway will still have to interact with pedestrians, traffic signals, and other vehicles at intersections. All of the four VAA applications could be used for this scenario. Similar to the designated lane scenario, a benefit of vehicle guidance is the ability to have a smaller lane width thus improving the odds of creating an at-grade transitway in an already crowded environment. Platooning is also a definite possibility in instances where there is high passenger demand. For automated vehicle operations to be implemented, all the other transit vehicles would have to be equipped, which is more likely in this scenario than others. Another potential benefit of an at-grade transitway is that if it exclusive to transit, it is likely to be eligible for New Start; thus another funding mechanism to pay for the technology.

There are existing deployed systems in Europe, Australia, and Japan that use at-grade transitways with VAA applications.  In some cases, such as Australia and UK, the mechanical guideway technology required exclusive lanes.  In other cases, the technology did not require exclusive lanes but exclusive lanes were deployed in order to provide more reliable bus service, or because of perceived safety issues.  

Fully Grade-Separated Exclusive Transitway
In this operational scenario, transit buses operate in exclusive lanes separated by grade, concrete barriers, or other devices. This has similar benefits to narrow lane, but with significantly greater infrastructure costs. Most current operations of VAA applications use an at-grade transitway, not a fully grade-separated exclusive transitway. There might not be additional safety or mobility benefits to using fully grade-separated lanes versus an at-grade transitway, depending on the signalization issues, but with regards to VAA applications, there are no real differences in terms of technology required. A separated lane with no traffic signals would definitely be faster than a separated lane where buses must stop at signalized intersections.  A fully-grade separated lane would remove all possibility of SOV motorists encroaching or conflicting with the VAA bus, but at significant infrastructure cost.  

All of the four VAA applications could be used for this scenario. Similar to the designated lane scenario, a benefit of vehicle guidance is the ability to have a smaller lane width, thus improving the odds of potentially creating a fully grade-separated exclusive transitway in an already crowded environment. Platooning is also a definite possibility in instances where there is high passenger demand. For automated vehicle operations to be implemented, all the other transit vehicles would have to be equipped, which is likely in this scenario. Another potential benefit of a fully grade-separated exclusive transitway is that it is likely to be eligible for New Start; thus there is another funding mechanism to pay for the technology. However, the drawbacks are great: costs would be in the range of $12 to 30 million per lane mile for aerial installations, and $60 to 105 million for underground installations.

<SUBJECT>A -- Development, Fabrication, Testing and Validation of Forensic Analysis Techniques
<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to negotiate with the University of Colorado at Denver (UCD), Campus Box 129, and P.O. Box 173364, Denver, CO for the development, fabrication, testing and validation of forensic analysis techniques.    BACKGROUND: The mission of NIST’s Electromagnetics Division includes providing methods of measuring and mapping magnetic fields for various analysis requirements.  To this end, the Magnetic Recording Metrology Project of the division is devoted to investigating methods of high-resolution imaging of fields above magnetic recording media. This imaging has applications in both data storage technology as well as forensic analysis of the samples. In addition to this work, the Magnetic Recording Metrology Project receives other-agency support to investigate related problems in magnetic data storage evaluation.  This other agency work supports the division's efforts on magnetic field metrology.  SCOPE: The specific work described here is to carry out a key component of the division’s contract with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to build prototype magnetic imaging systems for forensic analysis. This project supports the broader NIST internally supported Competence program in magnetic sensors. The scope of the work will be to construct real time systems for forensic analysis of cassette, Digital Audio Tape (DAT), and Digital Data Storage (DDS) tape for the FBI and conduct validation studies using samples provided by the FBI.  This work is based on the fact that the FBI is still receiving many analog audio cassettes for investigation. In addition, DAT tapes are also beginning to be submitted in ever increasing numbers. Finally, the DDS format (used in 911 logging systems) is expected to be used for the next decade. Currently, there is no way to verify the authenticity of these tapes. Because recent court suits have set the precedent for use of these tapes in court, it is important to evaluate new methods for this format.  In these systems, arrays of magnetoresistive (MR) elements will be used to detect stray fields from the tapes. UCD will fabricate large linear arrays (256 element) of Nickel-Iron alloy magneto-resistive arrays in the cleanroom at NIST in Boulder, CO. UCD will be responsible for integrating the arrays with custom multiplexing electronics and mechanical tape transport systems, for each different format, to allow investigators to visualize the magnetic patterns on the tapes as it slides past the sensors. These designs will include, but not be limited to, development of a 4 mm wide, offset array that is compatible with the digital audio tape format and a 13 mm wide version that is compatible with video tape format. The sensors should obtain the strength of the magnetic field perpendicular to the tape at a nominal distance of 5 micrometers, with a signal to noise ratio of 40 dB. In addition, UCD will conduct validation studies for the FBI. These studies will be done on-site in the NIST laboratory located in Boulder, Colorado and in collaboration with the FBI to ensure independent verification of blind studies and tests.   PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The contract to be negotiated is for a 12 month study. SOLE SOURCE: NIST has determined that UCD is the only contractor that can provide the technical expertise necessary to carry out this work in a timely fashion.  Dr. Fabio da Silva through the Physics Department at UCD is uniquely qualified to carry out the completion of a realtime magnetic imaging system that is compatible with both analog cassette and digital audio tapes.  NIST requires an individual with these minimum skills: (1) proficient at using the NIST Object Oriented Magnetic Modeling Framework to analyze the magnetic response of micro- and nano-scale magnetic elements; (2) able to quickly develop the computer software to directly create computer files from the Object Oriented Magnetic Modeling Framework for input into the NIST-Boulder mask design software (XIC) needed to create the reticle masks for device fabrication , (3) able to develop,  troubleshoot, and personally conduct a process, from scratch, in the NIST cleanroom to fabricate the arrays on 3” silicon wafers. This includes 500 nm liftoff process, ion mill, reactive ion etching, photolithography, and chemical vapor deposition of silicon dioxide, (4) a proven track record of designing and fabricating magnetic arrays of at least 64 elements on a 64 micron pitch, (5) the individual must be proficient in the area of: (a) anisotropic magnetic sensors, (b) magnetic force microscopy, (c) Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometry, (d) Vibrating Sample magnetometry, (e) and making ultra-soft amorphous magnetic alloys. Dr. Fabio da Silva is the only individual qualified to carry out this specific component of the FBI supported work.  Dr. da Silva has the required experience described above and has worked on this and related projects for the past 4 years.  This is not a formal solicitation.     This notice may represent the only notice. See note 22.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Notice of Second Public Meeting on GSA's proposed reorganization of the Federal Technology Service and Federal Supply Service
<DESC>AGENCY: GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION 

ACTION: Notice of public meeting. 

SUMMARY: General Services Administrator Stephen A. Perry testified on March 16, 2005, before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform regarding the agency's efforts to improve performance by reorganizing and consolidating the General Services Administration’s (GSA) Federal Technology Service (FTS) and  Federal Supply Service (FSS) into the Federal Acquisition Service (FAS). In his testimony, Administrator Perry stated: We believe that it is important for organizations that desire to achieve high performance and continuous improvement to periodically review their operations and organizational structures in order to make improvements where possible. He also emphasized that this initiative is designed to: strengthen GSA's ability to meet increasing customer requirements for excellence in the acquisition of information and other products and services; make it easier for industry contractors to understand and use our acquisition process; and enhance the efficiency of GSA’s administrative support functions by consolidating certain activities that are now performed in separate units. Visit gsa.gov (http://www.gsa.gov//Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?pageTypeId=8199&channelId=-13338&P=S&contentId=18335&contentType=GSA_BASIC) to view a copy of Administrator Perry's prepared testimony.

On April 21, 2005, GSA conducted an industry day meeting to obtain viewpoints from participants concerning the proposed reorganization.  GSA continues to be committed to obtaining industry input and is seeking additional input on the draft reorganization plan.

<DESC>SCOPE OF WORK

Project Name:  	CA PRA GOGA 210(1)/418(1) EAST ROAD
			CA PRA GOGA 108(1) FIELD ROAD
			CA PRA GOGA 109(1) CONZELMAN

Project Location:  Marin Headlands inside the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Sausalito, California.  This geotechnical and pavements investigation is along 11 roads of various lengths from a couple hundred yards to 4 miles.  Total length of the investigation will be approximately 9 miles.

Scope of Work:  

Part I.  Every quarter of a mile, auger the pavement with a 6-8 inches diameter core bit.  We anticipate 50 cores. Provide a truck-mounted drill capable of rapidly being mobilized after completion of each coring.  The equipment should be able to complete 3 to 4 coring per hour under normal circumstances.   FHWA personnel will conduct a Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) test at these dry core locations and sample the base course.  The base course cannot be wet or disturbed except for a minor ring caused by the core bit.  This work will be performed within the traveled way.  Cold patch supplied by the driller will be used to backfill the core holes.  Cold patch must be compacted with a flathead rod or other appropriate device.

Part II.  Drill approximately 17 borings (about every mile), 3 ft. – 5 ft. deep along the roadway and parking areas of the 9-mile proposed projects.  Again, all work will be performed within the traveled way.  Provide a truck-mounted drill capable of rapidly being mobilized after completion of each boring.  The equipment should be able to complete 3 borings per hour under normal circumstances.   Provide 8 in – 12 in. diameter solid or hollow stem augers or an equivalent capable of providing minimum 75 lbs of subgrade sample per boring.  Boring shall be backfilled and compacted with remaining cuttings or native material, and plugged with asphalt cold patch supplied by the driller.  To speed the process along, Part II will be combined with Part I.

Part III.  Core the pavement at 4 to 6 locations with at least a 15-inch cookie cutter type core.   Asphalt pavement, base course, and subgrade soil will be sampled at these sites.  Approximately 150 lbs of each material will be collected at each of these sites.  Three or four 15-inch cores per location maybe necessary to obtain sufficient sample size.  Cold patch supplied by the driller will be used to backfill the core holes.  Cold patch must be compacted with appropriate equipment.

Part IV.  Advance approximately 15 geotechnical borings at various locations along the subject routes.  All borings will be conducted from the roadway prism at proposed retaining wall, cut wall, and slope failure locations.  Borings will be advanced with either hollow stem augers or casing advancer system through soil and into bedrock consisting of fractured greywacke and chert.  Maximum boring depths are anticipated to be up to 50 feet, with a majority of borings being conducted to a termination depth of approximately 30 feet.  Core drilling will be required to a minimum length of 10 feet in each boring.  Standard penetration tests (SPT) will be taken at 5-foot intervals in soils.  
 
Proposed Equipment:  Include a list, which specifies the equipment to be used for the above noted work (type of drill rig, SPT hammer, etc.)

Required Time:  This work should take approximately 7 to 10 working days to complete.  Work to begin at 8:30 am, July 12, 2005.  Meet FHWA personnel at the parking lot at the east portal of the Fort Barry Baker Tunnel, intersection of Bunker Road and Danes Drive. 

Other Notable Information:  FHWA will provide personnel on-site to determine the locations and depths for each boring and log the borings and sample bags.  The contractor shall provide asphalt cold patch for each boring cored location and method for compaction of soil and cold mix.   Drill cuttings can be dispersed at the site.  Water is available nearby.  FHWA will obtain all required permits, provide utility locate, and provide traffic control.
   
Information to be Included in Each Proposal:

1. Mobilization/Demobilization (Lump sum cost)

2. Drilling Costs. (Hourly rate, to include equipment, operator helper, support truck, water truck, and minor equipment and supplies required to perform drilling).  

3. Stand-by (Hourly rate), if required.

4. Per Diem (Daily rate per person)

5. Estimate of miscellaneous materials to include, core boxes, asphalt patch, etc.  

6. 5-gal buckets w/lids (approximately 20 to 32 buckets) suitable for shipping samples.  These buckets will be used for samples from Part III.

7. Miscellaneous expenses.  (Replacement auger bits, etc.)  If there are no charges for a specific item please note.

8. Business Classification

9. Tax Identification Number

10. DUNS Number

HSAR 3052.209–70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE 
                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

 (a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002.

Questions 22 Apr 05

1)  The budget seems to be $50-$60K and I am unclear as to whether or not the trash cans, squeegee, and the fencing with access gates needs to be included in the budget price?

The budget includes all tear down and clean up.  We will not have huge trash cans in the area.  Not sure what the need for squeegee’s are.  The company will have to take the current fence off (or a portion of it) in order to get the equipment in and set up.  They will be responsible for putting the fence back on as well. 

 
2)  The dimensions are listed as "two end-to-end tennis courts".  Would you have the exact dimensions because even "official" sized tennis courts vary in size.  Our recommended design may change even if there are only a few feet difference in pad dimensions.

The dimensions are 100 ft long by 45 ft wide

 
3)  Do you have a design that you currently like or a list of ramps that you would like to see in the design?

  We do have a design that we like – we can show it on the site visit. 

 
4)  We will give a design and quote for the requested specification. We also want to know if we can submit another quote for a different option.
 
   We would like to see a quote for all designs, and we will accept different options as long as minimum requirements are met.
