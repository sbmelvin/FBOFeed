If the use changes, those exemptions may no longer apply and the tank<br />must be removed and if still needed will require replacement with an above<br />ground tank.<br /><br />4.4.5 Removal must follow the standards for removal and closure of registered tanks as outlined in the Georgia Underground Storage Tank Management Program (GA<br />USTMP) guidance document (ref GA Rules 391-3-15-.11). As a minimum oil samples<br />must be taken and analyzed from the excavated pit's walls and floor. A groundwater<br />sample must be taken if a soil sample is not possible from beneath the UST. Soil and<br />groundwater samples must be tested for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX), total petroleum hydrocarbons-diesel range organics (TPH-DRO), and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The USTs and associated piping must be removed and triple rinsed with water. Rinse water must be containerized (in drums or a tank) and analytical testing conducted by a certified Georgia laboratory, so the product can be correctly coded/classified on a Non-hazardous Manifest signed by an authorized representative from the Installation DPW Environmental Division. Disposal of materials (soil/rinseate) must be coordinated with the Installation DPW Environmental Division.<br />

However, interested parties may submit a description of their firm's capabilities for satisfying this requirement, which demonstrates they possess the ability to successfully perform this effort.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Somalogic Inc, 2945 Wilderness Pl, Boulder, CO 80301, to procure a SOMAscan HTS Assay Kit that is required by the Center for Human Immunology for plasmatic protein detection.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The research performed in the Center for Human Immunology's (CHI) Flow Cytometry Section involves characterizing the protein expression in human sera. Previously, the lab had used a Luminex platform for proteomics, but has now installed a SOMAscan machine to do this work. In order to run assays on the SOMAscan, CHI needs to purchase kits for plasmatic protein detection.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire a SOMAscan HTS Assay Kit, that the laboratory will use for plasmatic protein detection on the SOMAscan machine. The laboratory will now purchase these kits in the 84-sample format instead of the 24-sample format that has been purchased previously, because this will allow the lab to reduce "batch effect" and improve sample consistency.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the following:</p>
<p>&bull; SOMAscan HTS Assay Kit 1.3k, Human Plasma</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>

<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source (for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold) and only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 325414, Biological Product (except Diagnostic) Manufacturing, and the Small Business Size Standard is 1250 employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). The resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-88 (May 16, 2016).</p>

It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement. The product shall be delivered within 30 days, from award of the contract.</p>
<p>The Intramural Research Program (IRP) is the internal research program of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), known for its synergistic approach to biomedical science. The Intramural Research Program (IRP) is the nation's biomedical research enterprise, with 1,200 Principal Investigators and more than 4,000 postdoctoral fellows conducting basic, translational, and clinical research.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Mental Health, Unit on Statistical Genomics requires upgrades to their existing PowerWulf Compute Engine Server for the units multiple ongoing projects. These projects focus on the identification of mechanism of mental health disorders' development. The NIMH researchers are currently using a PSSC Labs PowerWulf Cluster for its research needs. At this time, to meet our researcher's growing demands an upgrade is necessary to this system. The cluster serves as storage as well hosting analytical tools for genomic studies of mental disorders. The unit which was purchased originally in fiscal year 2011, has limited capacity. Therefore, in order to increase power, and have additional storage space the branch requires the upgrades from PSSC Labs, where the original server was purchased.</p>
<p>Product Description:<br />The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) requires an upgrade to the NIMH-owned PowerWulf Cluster. The contractor is responsible for the following:</p>
<p>&bull; 3 Additional Compute Node &amp; 1+ Pbyte Advanced Storage Solution<br />o Node Configuration Details on Following Page<br />&bull; Total 36 Intel Xeon Cores on Compute Nodes / 2.4 GHz<br />o 12 x Intel Xeon Cores Per Compute Node<br />&bull; 384 GB High Performance ECC Registered Memory on Compute Nodes<br />o 128 GB Memory Per Compute Node<br />&bull; 1+ PByte Advanced Storage Array Includes<br />o 6 x SureStore U4000HD Storage Platforms<br />o Each SureStore U4000HD includes 200+ TB Raw Storage Space<br />o Each SureStore U4000HD includes 12 Processor Cores<br />o Each SureStore U4000HD includes 128GB System Memory<br />o Each SureStore U4000HD incldes 2 x 10GigE Network Connection<br />&bull; 10 GigE High Speed Network Backplane<br />&bull; Management &amp; Monitoring Network Include<br />o 48 Port GigE Network Switch<br />o IPMI / iKVM Management Backplane<br />&bull; Rack &amp; Power Infrastructure provided by NIH<br />o Professional Integration of Network and Power Cabling<br />&bull; Hawkeye Cluster Management Toolkit<br />o CentOS Linux Latest PSSC Labs Supported 64 Bit Operating System<br />o Hawkeye Feature Details on Following Page<br />&bull; Free NAS Operating System offering the following features:<br />o Replication<br />o Data Protection<br />o Encryption o Snapshots o File Sharing<br />o Web Interface<br />o Performance Testing &amp; Benchmarking Included<br />&bull; Onsite Spare Maintenance Kit Included</p>
<p>Thus, NIMH, Unit on Statistical Genomics, on a sole source basis plans to procure a CLOUDSTORE STORAGE SOLUTION &amp; POWERWULF UPGRADE, PN: PS-CLOUDSTORE-NIH-CSTM-3 from PSSC Labs. PSSC Labs is the only company that can perform the upgrades, as the company does not permit any third party companies or resellers to sell or perform upgrades on our PowerWulf Cluster systems. Any work performed by an unauthorized third party on a PowerWulf Cluster would result in immediate hardware and software warranty termination.</p>

SET-ASIDE: This project is set-aside 100% for small businesses under applicable NAICS codes, including series 236***, and 238990. Your SAM record must reflect that your company is small under the related NAICS code. If you are not sure of your business size, please email KimberleyRobinson@nps.gov with your companys DUNS number. Your company must have been registered in SAM at some point to ascertain the business size at the time of enrollment. The Contracting Officer encourages vendors who are new to working with the federal government (those that have not been awarded a federal contract, or have never been awarded a National Park Service contract) to submit bids.
MAGNITUDE: The magnitude of this project is less than $25,000.00.
BONDS: No bonds are required for this project.
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Petrified Forest National Park, Coconino County, Painted Desert Inn, Petrified Forest AZ 86028. This park is located in eastern Arizona off of Interstate 40. www.NPS.gov/PEFO.
REQUIREMENT: This is a construction contract with a supply requirement, also referred to as provide and install. The construction portion involves removing, cutting, crating, and possible demolishing. Please refer to the scope of work. The supply is a Greenheck GB-420 Belt Drive downdraft exhaust fan with 2HP, or an approved equal. The Painted Desert Inn is a historical structure. The contractor who is selected for this project is responsible for providing all materials, labor, & supervision to complete it. 
PAST PERFORMANCE: With your bid, please submit one project your firm has completed in the past five years of a similar scope and magnitude. If your company is newly formed (a bunch of really smart construction folk have 30 years of industry experience, but partnered & began the business only three years ago), send the name of the Project Manager, or someone, with pertinent experience, who will be directly involved with this contract, and a very brief description of that persons skills, such as Pauline has 10 years of HVAC expertise, specializing in historical structures. No need to get all fancy; the CO will request more information if necessary.
UTILITIES will be available for the Contractors use, within reason, during normal business hours. Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.236-14, Availability and Use of Utility Services, pertains to the resulting purchase order.
BID DUE DATE is Saturday, 11 June 2016, 1800h (6pm) Eastern (not local!) time. Your quote must be valid for at least 30 days.

BID ACCEPTANCE: Please email your quote to KimberleyRobinson@nps.gov, or FAX it to (928) 637.7005 by 6:pm Eastern time on Saturday, 11 June 2016. The NPS will not accept or consider late bids. Please DO NOT submit bids via FedConnect or FBO. 
SITE VISIT: The NPS does not require that you attend a site visit, but we strongly encourage it. A group site visit will be on Thursday, June 2nd 2016, 10:00 am LOCAL TIME at the Painted Desert Inn. On this day, you can call or text the CO at (928) 225-5103 if you are lost or running late.

RESPONSIVE QUOTES: In order for the NPS to consider your quote responsive (complete & acceptable), it must be all-inclusive. If there are any quotes that have a note excluding any factors, or stating that anything will be calculated after award, such as sales tax or shipping/freight, the CO will consider these non-responsive. Please check sales tax requirements at www.AzDOR.gov. 
SALES TAX: Federal government entities located within Arizona are not exempt from sales tax. Please contact the Arizona Department of Revenue to ensure your company is aware of the tax requirement. Quote sales tax as a separate line item.
AWARD: The Contracting Officer anticipates awarding a FIRM FIXED PRICE purchase order to the firm that presents the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) by, or around, 24 June 2016. The period of performance will be approximately 60 days, starting from date of award. 
FIRM-FIXED PRICE means the Contracting Officer will not add funding to the order due to omissions or errors in your bid. The purchase order will match the quote; the invoice cannot exceed the purchase order and any agreed upon modifications.
INVOICING: The vendor who completes this work must submit all invoices / payment requests through the Invoice Processing Platform (www.IPP.gov).

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) has a requirement for the selection of a quality Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) contractor for the Fa&ccedil;ade-Garage Project at the Richard H. Poff Federal Building, located in Roanoke, VA.
<p><br />This project will utilize the Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) project delivery method.</p>
<p>The Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) project delivery method is sometimes also known as the Construction Manager at-Risk project delivery method.</p>
<p>The Government contemplates the use of a Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) with Construction Contingency Allowance and Shared Savings contract.</p>
<p>The project includes requirements for Design Phase Services and the option(s) for Construction Services at a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP).</p>
<p>The Richard H. Poff Federal Building was constructed in 1974. This steel framed, high rise building with masonry fa&ccedil;ade and glass curtain walls contains 254,671 rentable square feet over 14 floors. The Poff building has 341,289 GSF. The building houses 750 employees, has 75 inside parking spaces, and 114 outdoor spaces. The Poff building is primarily general office space, with 4 courtrooms and some specialized law enforcement space.</p>
<p>The overall project objectives include:</p>
<p>&bull;	Remove all existing brick from the building<br />&bull;	Install new brick on east, west, and wing walls<br />&bull;	Resurfacing of the garage upper deck<br />&bull;	Repair of spalled and deteriorated concrete<br />&bull;	Installation of Perimeter Security including but not limited to vehicle barriers, access gates, and fencing.<br />&bull;	Phasing plan to minimize impact to building tenants<br />&bull;	Maintain daily operations and security of the building</p>
<p>The brick replacement will involve the demolition of all brick on the east wall and four (4) wing walls, and installation of new brick on the east wall, west wall, and four (4) wing walls. The project will be phased in such a way to minimize overall tenant impact. The garage repairs will involve removal of the asphalt paving overlay, removal of the deteriorated surface of the structural slab and overlaying with concrete sloped toward the existing deck drains and removal of spalled and deteriorated concrete on the underside of the structural slab, beams, girders and columns and repairing with an appropriate repair material. The perimeter security work involves bringing the site up to current Interagency Security Committee (ISC) Standards. This will be done by installing vehicle barriers, access gates, fencing, and other physical security measures.<br />This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis.<br />The NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) Code for this procurement is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction). The annual small business size standard is $36.5 million.</p>
<p>The estimated price range for the Project is between $10,000,000.00 and $15,000,000.00.</p>
<p>The approach to source selection for this procurement will be pursuant to the best value tradeoff concept as identified in FAR Part 15.101-1 and FAR Part 15.3. Award may be made without discussions. It is the government's intention to award a contract to the offeror whose proposal conforms to the RFP requirements and is considered to be most advantageous to the government, price and technical factors considered.  Competitive proposals shall be evaluated and assessed based on the factors specified in this solicitation.  For this solicitation, the combined weight of the technical evaluation factors is significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice.</p>
<p>A Pre-proposal conference will be held at the Poff Federal Building on or about January 20, 2016 at 10:00am, local Roanoke time.</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION ONLY: THIS SYNOPSIS IS ONLY A NOTIFICATION THAT A SOLICITATION IS ANTICIPATED AND FORTHCOMING.
<p><br />TITLE: Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC) For Design-Build Construction In Support of Military Health System (MHS)</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: THIS ACQUISITION IS FOR FIRM-FIXED PRICE (FFP) INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) MULTIPLE AWARD TASK ORDER CONTRACTS (MATOC) FOR DESIGN BUILD (DB) CONSTRUCTION.</p>
<p>The MHS relies on the support of the Air Force Medical Support Agency (AFMSA) and the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) - Little Rock District (CESWL) to execute its health facility program. A means to manage this program is via Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC). Under these contracts, the contractor provides all necessary labor, material, supervision, and equipment for the design, construction, repair/alteration, and outfitting to sustain, restore, and/or modernize hospitals, clinics, medical administration buildings, ambulatory health facilities, medical warehouses, medical labs, biological engineering labs, dental clinics, veterinary clinics, wellness centers, and any other healthcare buildings, using recapitalization funding and processes.</p>
<p>The Scope of Work (SOW) for the resultant contracts will primarily be associated with the renovation of existing facilities, but may also include major repair and new construction. Work may include mechanical (to include medical gas and plumbing), electrical, fire protection, architectural (to include building envelope), conveying systems, structural (to include antiterrorism/force protection), and civil/site infrastructure. This requirement will be performed within the CONUS to include AK and HI. This work is performed in ongoing active healthcare facilities.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be a firm-fixed price (FFP), indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ), multiple award task order (MATOC), for design-build construction services. It will be procured using the two phase design-build selection procedures in accordance with FAR Part 36.3. The acquisition is unrestricted with a small business reserve. A combined pool of three (3) or more small business Offerors and three (3) or more Offerors comprising the unrestricted pool will be established with a shared capacity of $900M. A small business reserve will be utilized in which all projects valued at $12 million and below will be a small business set aside within the MATOC. Projects valued at over $12 million will be competed among all MATOC holders. If there is no competition on a project valued at $12 million and below from small business, then the project will be competed among all MATOC holders. The contract duration will be for a base ordering period of twenty-four (24) months plus three (3) twelve (12) month option periods.</p>
<p>Most projects (task orders) will range between $750K and $75M with an average performance period of 2-4 years. The scope of the work includes "cradle-to-grave" services such as design, construction, outfitting, excessing moves (aka "transition"), and demolition and will be predominately healthcare facilities such as inpatient care, outpatient clinics, medical research and labs, outpatient rehabilitation, dental, veterinary, pharmacies, etc. Most projects will be required to meet LEED certification, range between 20,000-400,000 SF, and involve either multi-phased renovation projects all while maintaining on-going healthcare operations or new construction. It is estimated that approximately six (6) to twelve (12) task orders will be executed annually so Contractor's may be required to simultaneously delivery multiple projects at different locations.</p>
<p>Projects will be mostly for Air Force clients, but other Federal/Department of Defense clients (such as Army) may also use the contract so familiarity with DOD and AF criteria is required. Using integrated project delivery (IPD) principles and Lean processes, the Contractor's and their partners/subcontractors will be required to work closely with multiple stakeholders to include users, owner and installation representatives, government subject matter experts, architectural review boards, etc.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 36.3, Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, a Two-Phase source selection process will be used to evaluate the Offerors for award.</p>
<p>In Phase I, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as "Offerors") may submit certain specified performance proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the DB contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capability in accordance with the criteria described in the Phase I solicitation documents. Those offerors who are considered the most highly qualified during Phase I (no more than five (5) small businesses and no more than five (5) firms from the unrestricted pool) will be requested to submit the proposal requirements for Phase II.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<p>Earth Science Magnetic Tape Data Recovery</p>
<p>THIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE.</p>
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (SD-WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU/Minority Institutions) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for the Earth Science Magnetic Tape Data Recovery procurement.  The Government reserves the right to consider a Small 8(a), WOSB, SD-VOSB, or HUBZone Business set-aside based on responses hereto.</p>
<p>The GES DISC project within Code 610.2 at the Goddard Space Flight Center has been tasked with recovering unique scientific data from magnetic tapes that are well past their expected media life.  The recovery of this data will extend the earth science data record for many types of measurements back through the early 1960s. In many cases these tapes are fragile and the strength of the imbedded signal significantly degraded.  In addition, the early drives on which these tapes were written were manually aligned and differences in alignments between drives could also make the tapes difficult to read. The data is on a variety of tape media which includes: 7-track tapes, 9-track tapes, 3480 tapes, and 8 mm tapes.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential interest in providing services for recovering the data from the media for the project. This is for information and planning purposes and to survey what capabilities are commercially available for extracting data from these media types.</p>
<p>The expected capabilities of the recovery process include at a minimum:</p>
<p>- Recover/transcribe data from tape to binary (8-bit byte) data file.</p>
<p>- Read the entire length of the media to ensure all possible data is recovered.</p>
<p>- Read the reel media at reduced speeds to reduce stress and friction.</p>
<p>- Handle media tracking issues, such as those resulting from degraded signal strength or alignment issues.</p>
<p>- Handle the problems of old media, including, but not limited to, sticky tapes and dry-rotted plastic hubs, including capability to bake the tapes to remove excess moisture.</p>
<p>- Include an inventory list showing the mapping between NASA tape number and recovered file, including digital picture of each media and labels.</p>
<p>- Provide a .csv inventory file of the individual file marks recovered from each tape to clearly identify the beginning and end of individual files on the media, number of records per file, number of bytes per record, and end of tape marker.</p>
<p>- Upon written permission from NASA after successful recovery, tapes shall be formally disposed. <br />Interested vendors/potential offerors having the required specialized technical capabilities to meet the above requirements should submit a capability statement of five (5) pages or less indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein. The response should include experience and past performance in the area of magnetic tape data recovery.</p>
<p>Responses must include the following:</p>
<p>1) Business name and address.</p>
<p>2) Size of business, average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees, ownership, whether they are large, or any category of small business, number of years in business, affiliate information, parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contract (if potential sub) or subcontractor (if potential prime).</p>
<p>3) Past performance information covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed) Provide a brief description of the topic/effort; the value of the action; if your company was the prime contractor or the subcontractor; and the point of contact (name of the company/Agency, customer's name, phone number, &amp; email address).</p>
<p>4) This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirements.</p>
<p>5) No solicitation exists, therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor the site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.</p>
<p>6) RFI responses and procurement related questions should be directed to NASA GSFC, Attn:  Ian P. Sherry, Code 210.Y, 8800 Greenbelt Road, Greenbelt, Maryland 20771, Email: Ian.P.Sherry@nasa.gov.  Responses are requested within 30-days after issuance of the synopsis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">With support from the U.S. Department of Energy&rsquo;s Building Technologies Office, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have developed the Retro-Commissioning (RCx) Sensor Suitcase technology. The RCx Sensor Suitcase provides a hardware and software solution that non-experts can use to generate low or no-cost recommendations automatically on how to improve a building&rsquo;s operating costs, comfort and energy performance. The DOE team is now looking to identify Vendor and Manufacturing Partners who can help manufacture the RCx Sensor Suitcase. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">The Sensor Suitcase is a hardware and software solution that non-experts can use to generate low- or no-cost recommendations automatically on how to improve a building's operating costs, comfort, and energy performance. The Sensor Suitcase embeds the knowledge and skills of a highly experienced building commissioning practitioner into a scalable hardware and software package that can be easily deployed by a variety of building services personnel to make it easier and more cost-effective for small building owners and operators to reap the benefits and cost savings for building commissioning.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">What market barrier does the technology address? </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Many commercial buildings do not perform as energy efficiently as they could, simply because energy-using equipment in the building has never been set up to maximize energy performance. Thermostat set points may be too low or too high, so rooftop units (RTUs) cool buildings down below recommended temperatures or keep them too warm (or both). Or, there may be no difference in the set point during hours when the building is unoccupied versus occupied; turning the heat and space conditioning down during unoccupied hours helps lower energy bills substantially. While traditional RCx is a possible solution, small commercial buildings &ndash; those between 5,000 and 50,000 square feet in size, which is 40% of the commercial buildings nationwide &ndash; do not typically have budgets or business models that allow for that kind of investment. Moreover, they also do not have &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; staff with expertise in building systems, and often cannot perform RCx or identify efficiency improvement opportunities. The result is that RCx is not performed, and opportunities to save energy and money are lost.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">What is the value proposition? </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">To the vendor/manufacturing provider:</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">The U.S. represents the most mature and largest ESCO market today with reported revenues of $6 billion in 2013, while the retro-commissioning market in the U.S. was $160 million in 2010. Service providers in these markets have largely been unable to serve the approximately 2 million &lsquo;untapped&rsquo; small buildings the U.S. in which the technology could be used. These small buildings comprise nearly 28 billion square feet of floor area.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">A number of these providers have expressed a desire for streamlined tools that will enable them to lower transaction costs, and expand their services to the small buildings market. These providers, along with utility programs and owners of portfolios of small buildings, will present a large market and an established purchasing base for the Suitcase technology. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">To owners and service provider technology users:</span></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">The Sensor Suitcase extensively streamlines the RCx process, thereby reducing labor costs of retro-commissioning through decreases in labor time and expertise required. It enables penetration of RCx into the small buildings sector, where low energy expenditures place tight constraints on payback and human capital. The Sensor Suitcase also offers a significant reduction in labor time/costs for RCx. It offers guided, substantially automated sensor configuration and installation, in contrast to logger solutions, which require expertise to select and deploy properly. The software and sensors eliminate the need for walkthrough, spot measurements, and engineering expertise to interpret data. The Sensor Suitcase enables less experienced staff to instrument and analyze sensed data on lighting and HVAC control and operations. The efficiency goal of the Sensor Suitcase is to realize average whole-building savings of up to 10% once simple measures are taken, such as using thermostat setback at night, eliminating short cycling of the rooftop units, using outdoor air economizing, and eliminating excessive daytime lighting use. (For reference, traditional RCx saves 16% on average, based on analysis of actual RCx projects by LBNL in 2009).</span></p>

<p><br /><br />Introduction</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under NAICS code 541990 should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Center for Scientific Review (CSR) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) receives grant applications and administers their evaluation based on scientific merit. Over 75% of grant applications sent to the NIH are reviewed by CSR. The evaluation is performed through a peer review process in which over 20,000 researchers are invited to participate in the review of at least 80,000 applications per year. Typically, applications are reviewed in one of three review cycles per year, corresponding to three council meetings that are held by the NIH institutes that consider applications for funding. CSR is organized into five reviewing divisions. Each division includes 4-6 Integrated Review Groups (IRGs) that focus on a disease area or scientific approach. Each IRG includes 1-8 standing study sections that review applications. The Scientific Review Officer (SRO) is the federal employee responsible for the conduct of the study section meetings. CSR review activities are funded for two years from the NIH Budget. However, there are many significant variables that affect our expenditures including the number of applications submitted to the NIH, the cost of NIH reviewer travel and lodging, and policy changes that affect our business practices.<br /><br />To meet the challenge of reporting CSR expenditures to management, CSR requires services for the design and development of ten specialized reports within the QlikView environment. The reports were used to help the CSR Budget Officer to monitor budget transactions and trends in the areas of budget allocations, personnel, travel and training. The QlikView software is a guided analytics and dashboard solution for the administrative and budget community to provide dynamic reporting of enterprise and Institute or Center (IC) owned data that complements the suite of reporting tools already provided by NIH.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) on behalf of the CSR is seeking small businesses with the ability to provide Qlikview application development and support services.</p>
<p>Project Requirements</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>Develop a budget modeling algorithm with QlikView based reports that can be utilized by CSR staff and contractors to model future expenditures, Full-time Employee (FTE) needs, and predict budget needs. The Contractor shall build new dashboards within the current CSR QlikView and SharePoint environments to streamline CSR budget formulation, execution, justification, and reporting activities using the QlikView. The Contractor shall provide ongoing maintenance and support to the QlikView dashboard.</p>
<p>Tasks:</p>
<p>Task #1: Integration of data between the QlikView dashboard (as well as other algorithm development software) and the following databases will be required to develop budget models: <br />&bull; NIH nVision applications: nVision is a data warehouse of all financial, human resources and travel data <br />&bull; CSR's Scientific Review and Evaluation Activities (SREA) database: The SREA business area coordinates meeting logistics and manages payment reimbursement for reviewer expenses<br />&bull; CSR's SharePoint Intranet: Portal for sharing of data among CSR users<br />&bull; NIH IMPAC database: Oracle based database on all NIH review activities including meeting dates and grant application information<br />&bull; Other internal NIH and CSR applications <br /><br />Task #2: Development of an algorithm to determine previous, current, and future SRO workload according to council round. Prediction of future workload will be a function of predicted application submission numbers at the study section, IRG, Division, and CSR levels. Data to be visualized in the dashboard according to user defined predictions of grant applications. Include the ability for the user to change key assumptions/variables.</p>
<p>Task #3: Development of an algorithm to determine FTE needs: Upon selection of IRG and a selection of application receipt increases (range to be determined through contractor analysis), dashboard returns number of SRO FTE equivalents required to meet IRG, Division, CSR level needs. Include the ability for the user to change key assumptions/variables.</p>
<p>Task #4: Predictive modeling and dashboard inclusion of current and future review costs: Upon selection of IRG and a selection of application receipt increases (range to be determined through contractor analysis), dashboard shall return review costs to meet IRG, Division, and CSR level needs. User can change key assumptions/variables.</p>
<p>Task #5: Streamline CSR budget formulation, execution, and reporting activities based on FTE and review costs using QlikView including the monitoring of previous and current expenses, the prediction of future financial needs and the ability to adjust expenses based on special initiatives and wish list items. Include methods of responding to NIH and congressional calls for information (data calls) such as efficient spending.</p>
<p>Task #6: Maintain the Dashboard and modify algorithms over the course of the contract to meeting changing needs of CSR. Respond to requests for modification of the current or future Dashboard such as adding new features, installing new plugins, or software.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A. Background:</span></p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative organized by the National Institute of Human Genome Research (NHGRI), the NIH Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) and the NIH Clinical center that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center with a mission that has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and diseases.</p>
<p>The goals of the UDP include finding accurate diagnoses and discovering new diseases that provide insight into human physiology and genetics. The UDP was established to evaluate participants who have undiagnosed medical conditions. UDP participants have generally received extensive diagnostic workups before traveling to the NIH and often have numerous and/or complex medical problems. The UDP program makes use of a diverse set of diagnostic and research techniques both to attempt to find a diagnosis and to generate research projects to advance medical knowledge. The unique tools and computing infrastructure is needed to improve, optimize and refine the UDP PhenoTips server that is currently deployed in the NIH UDP laboratory. These support the research needs of the UDP by providing a robust platform on which to perform the necessary phenotype analysis and record them into the PhenoTips server to be viewed by laboratory personnel and collaborators.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B. Purpose and Objectives</span>:</p>
<p>The purpose is to further develop the user interface for entering skeletal digital image data that is structured by patient anatomical features. The improvements will allow the NIH UDP to select relevant organ structures and map image data to appropriate HPO terms within the PhenoTips server that has been integrated into the UDP LIMS system that was designed to manage UDP patient samples, clinical and research data throughout the UDP program. The PhenoTips server is used by the clinical staff to input patient phenotype data into the LIMS system using standardized HPO terms. The further development will include a more effective interface that includes structured anatomical organs that can be mapped to appropriate HPO terms. The Contractor will also develop API's that will be used to connect UDPICs variants to the UDP PhenoTips instance, which will allow the system to be used with PhenomeCentral. Integral to these processes are constant updates to the UDP PhenoTips instances on the collaborator and internal sites in order to determine infrastructure that may be needed to improve, optimize and refine the UDP PhenoTips server, and LIMS system.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contractor's Requirement</span>:</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor will develop improvements to the skeletal imaging user interface: <br />o The Contractor will contain the ability to structure image data by anatomical organs<br />o The Contractor will contain the ability to rapidly select organ structure that have been mapped to HPO terms<br />o The Contractor will add novel relevant HPO terms at the discretion of the HPO development team<br />&bull; The Contractor will provide synchronization between the internal and external instances of PhenoTips, inclusive of the UDN network.<br />&bull; The Contractor will develope API's to transfer patient variant data from NHGRI UDPics into PhenoTips in order to allow for the system to be used by PheonmeCentral.<br />&bull; The Contractor will provide one-year of PhenoTips support:<br />o The Contractor will respond to emails within one business day to provide an preliminary estimate of turnaround time;<br />&#61607; Level 1: The Contractor's system unavailable or significant functionality failure will be fixed within 24 hours;<br />&#61607; Level 2: The Contractor's system unavailable or some functionality failure will be fixed within 48 hours; and<br />&#61607; Level 3: The Contractor's other system faults will be fixed within two weeks or on an agreed upon timeframe with the Government NHGRI-UDP.<br />o The Contractor will install new PhenoTips versions throughout the year as available.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C. Procurement:</span></p>

<DESC>SMALL BUSIENSS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
<p>DATE: May 20, 2016</p>
<p>TITLE: Quality Audit Services - ASPR/BARDA</p>
<p>NOTICE No. 16-BARDA-RQA_Quality Audit Services</p>

Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy, including whether a small business set-aside is a possibility.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government (USG). The USG is currently conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 10, to identify potential small business sources to fulfill the requirement and gather information on current capabilities within the market. All information submitted in response to this sources sought notice is voluntary and the USG will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the USG. Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately. All submitted information shall remain with the USG and will not be returned.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) requires quality oversight through the Division Regulatory and Quality Affairs (RQA) for the development, acquisition, stockpiling and the use of medical products that are needed to effectively respond to variety of high-consequences public health emergencies, whether naturally occurring or intentional. The mission and priorities of the HHS Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures, Enterprise (PHEMCE) are articulated in the PHEMCE Strategy Implementation Plan (SIP) https://www.phe.gov.</p>
<p>The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, signed into law on December 19, 2006 and reauthorized in March 2013, codifies HHS as the lead of Federal public health and medical response to public health emergencies and National Response Plan incidents and specified that one of the duties of the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response is to oversee advanced research, development, and procurement of qualified countermeasures and qualified pandemic or epidemic products. Title III, Enhancing Medical Countermeasure Review and Title IV, Accelerating Medical Countermeasure Advanced Research and Development calls for the successful lifecycle management of medical countermeasure through development, acquisition, stockpiling and use. To that end, RQA will work with regulatory agencies like the FDA and BARDA, partners in industry and academia, to help minimize the inherent risks with development, regulatory review and approval processes.</p>
<p>Medical countermeasures could be a biological product, device, drug or a combination product. The development and regulatory process would be under the requirements of the Food and Drug Act and the amendments, regulations, and applicable guidance(s) to that Act. Biological and combination biological products will also be under the requirements of the Public Health Service Act amendments, regulations and applicable guidance (s) to the Act.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT</p>

<p>BARDA requires quality oversight through the Division Regulatory and Quality Affairs (RQA) for the development, acquisition, stockpiling and the use of medical products that are needed to effectively respond to variety of high-consequences public health emergencies, whether naturally occurring or intentional.</p>
<p>BARDA will not award any contracts under this Notice, but rather availabilities, capabilities, and other pertinent marketplace data to strengthen BARDA's understanding of the current and future marketplace, enhance its ability to obtain quality services economically, efficiently and lawfully and establish potential vendor source files and listings.</p>
<p>The USG seeks an organization with access to highly qualified people with extensive experience, proven track record in auditing for compliance to GXP, and a proven record of achieving successful results with quality and compliance.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT
The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Service Area Office - Central (SAOC), is seeking sources for supply for Custom Sterile Procedure Packs for VHA medical centers located within SAO East (SAOE) and SAO West (SAOW) Regions.   
CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS:
VA/VHA/SAOC
708 South 3rd Street
Suite 108E
Minneapolis, MN 55415
INTRODUCTION:
This is a SOURCES SOUGHT TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION to determine the availability and technical capability of any qualified, capable & responsible business/source; to include small businesses (including the following subsets, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, HUBZone Firms; Certified 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses and Woman Owned Small Business) to provide the required products and/or services.
 
BACKGROUND:
Medical Centers within SAOE and SAOW perform a variety of surgeries ranging from very complex cardiac surgery to less complex intermediate surgeries such as joint replacement to more standard non-complex hernia repair and/or Ear Nose Throat (ENT) surgeries.  Being able to order custom surgical packs are the preferred method versus ordering non-custom surgical packs.  Ordering a custom made pack for the type of surgery will; reduce errors in surgical instruments provided in the packs, reduce time for surgical set-up, create a standard practice in Operating Room (OR), and/or reduce OR turnover between surgical procedures.  Custom Sterile Procedure Packs are currently being procured by sole-source bridge contracts, purchase cards, and open market purchase orders.  The various contracting vehicles have resulted in lost opportunity for cost reduction, capturing standardization opportunities, increasing the number of purchase orders, quality consistency risk resulting in potential patient care issues, and the procurement lead time has been increased to ordering open market items.

REQUIRED CAPABILITIES:
The purpose of this sources sought is to identify possible firms that are capable of becoming a committed source of supply for production and delivery of individualized custom sterile procedure packs to be utilized by each of the estimated 127 medical centers in AK, WA, OR, ID, CA, HI, NV, AZ, NM, UT, WY, MT, CO, OK, TX, AL, GA, FL, SC, NC, VA, WV, PA, MD, DE, NJ, NY, VT, HA, MA, RI, ME, D.C., Puerto Rico, Philippines, and Guam.  The custom sterile procedure pack program will include but not limited to; pack manufacturing, pack sterilization, quality assurance, and packaging, web based ordering/tracking systems, reporting, and pack delivery.  Specific Contractor must be registered with the FDA and all aspects of pack assembly, packaging and sterilization must adhere to quality control standards set by the FDA.  The sterilization shall be at least ISO 9001:2000 certified and must be validated at a minimum annually by the Association for Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI).  The manufacturing shall be in compliance with American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM), Safe Medical Device Act, and Association of Operating Room Nurses (AORN).   

SOURCES SOUGHT:
The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 339113 - Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees.  Review of the Small Business Administration's (SBA) non-manufacture class waiver list indicates that this NAICS description does not qualify for a non-manufacture waiver. 

SUBMISSION DETAILS:
All responses to question below shall be submitted in writing and via email to Julie Willie at julieann.willie@va.gov and/or Nicole Kutsi at nicole.kutsi@va.gov No Later Than (NTL) March 23, 2016.  Email subject line must read "Sources Sought Custom Packs SAOE and SAOW "Company Name".  

The attachment you submit must be named: "Company name" VA240C-16-N-0005.  If for some reason a second email is needed to submit a response please note this in subject line and attachment name.  Example: add to the end of subject line and attachment name: 1 of 2 or 1 of 3 etc. Your response should list each question and a response directly after each question.  Please explain clearly and concisely and do not respond to a question directing us to a specific website link to search for an answer.

NOTE: For security purposes our email only allows 8MB, so your attachment must be 8MB or less on each email.

**DRAFT PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT
A.	GENERAL INFORMATION

1.	Title of Project: Veterans Benefits Optimization Model

2.	Scope of Work: This contract shall provide advanced predictive modeling, simulation modeling, and analytical consultation services in support of Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) leadership decisions on delivery of future benefits and services to Veterans. The contract shall identify quantitative elements for prioritizing demand and capacity requirements and establish a functional system for accurately and continuously measuring impact of VBA services on Veteran socio-economic outcomes.  

3.	Background: Currently VBA's forecast methods for determining benefits demand and output capacity differ across Line of Business (LOB).  These approaches do not consider how the demand and outputs from one LOB affects those of another LOB in a consistent and integrated way. The project will create a uniform and quantitative method to forecast benefits demand, measure output capacity,  identify mission requirements gaps between demand and capacity, an estimate the resource cost to close the gap, and the consequences to the Veteran of not closing the gap.  This project will allow VBA to create an integrated format for demand forecasting, determine the interdependencies between LOB activities, and evaluate resource prioritization.  It is critical that resource planning be done to determine improvements in workforce capabilities.  The improvements that can be achieved require longer term planning so that the workforce capabilities are optimized to deliver benefits to service members, Veterans, family members, and survivors in an efficient and effective manner.  Moreover a better understanding is needed to determine how benefits and combination of benefits affects the Veteran so that the right priorities and tradeoffs can be made.  

4.	Period of Performance: The period of performance is one (1) twelve (12) month base period plus three (3) optional twelve (12) month periods.

5.	Place of Performance: The Contractor personnel shall be performing at both government site and Contractor business locations.  The Government will provide work and meeting space for two on-site Contractor personnel at VBA central office located at: 

U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
Veterans Benefits Administration, Office of Strategic Planning
1800 G St., NW
Washington, DC  20006
Additionally the government will also provide a laptop and printing for each onsite personnel.  The Contractor shall provide space and equipment at their business locations for the remaining personnel.

B.	SPECIFIC TASKS and DELIVERABLES

Task 1: Project Management Plan (PMP): Focused on tasks, dependencies between tasks, level of effort per task, and estimated due dates.
Deliverable 1.1: Initial project management plan (PMP) that identifies all tasks, deliverables, resources to be utilized, timetables, milestones and delivery dates for the base year and each option years.  The PMP shall be submitted within 20 work days after the award of the contract for the base year and with 20 work days after the commencement of each option years.
Deliverable 1.2:  A bi-weekly status report meeting with an agenda prior to the meeting, followed up with meeting minutes. 
Deliverable 1.3: A monthly report emailed three (3) work days after the last work day of every month on the project status.
Task 2: Integrated Demand Forecasting Models: Develop demand forecasting and simulation models using state of the art econometric methods and encompassing performance standards, Veteran demand, and the relationship between resources and productivity.  Inform VBA on an integrated, enterprise-wide level the organizational performances needed to meet Veteran services demand.  Ascertain areas where forecasted demand exceeds performance capacity and quantitatively demonstrate the level of resources and performance improvements necessary to meet standards.  The models shall be integrated across LOBs utilizing VBA internal Veteran and claim data from the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW), data collected from each LOB, and external socioeconomic factors from other government data, such as the American Community Survey, to identify evidence- based resources requirements as a function of:
o	Veteran demographics (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity) 
o	Service characteristics (e.g., time since active duty separation, theater of war)
o	Service-connected disability rating

<DESC>The purpose of this Notice is to identify the availability of capable small businesses (e.g., 8(a), Hub-zone, women-owned, veteran-owned) able to provide a "Software as a Service" (SAAS) information management system to support USAID's Global Health Ebola Team (GHET). USAID staff and implicated implementing partners would use the Ebola Information Management System as a means of collating, storing and managing quantitative and qualitative programmatic data and progress reports from implementing partners (IPs) and headquarters (HQ) staff so that indicator results can be monitored and so that timely reports can be obtained on progress made against established GHET objectives. Currently, this responsibility is required to be completed manually and can be substantially resource intensive (i.e. labor and time). Additionally, USAID seeks to obtain industry questions and/or comments for this planned data management system. Interested businesses must have the ability to provide an easily adaptable SAAS information management system.

<RESPDATE>060316

<DESC>Pathfinder #3 Request for Information (RFI)
<p><strong>1.0 Introduction</strong><br />The U.S. Government (USG) is pursuing the Pathfinder series in support of future Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) procurements supporting Department of Defense (DoD) operations. The Pathfinder series is developing the business and technical capabilities necessary for the USG to more effectively access available satellite resources for the warfighter worldwide. This RFI addresses a flexible terminal-to-modem interface and ground infrastructure concepts needed to support an adaptable network in achieving an affordable and resilient system. This RFI will directly support Pathfinder #3, which plans to provide the warfighter with flexible access to COMSATCOM and Military SATCOM (MILSATCOM) capacity.</p>
<p>Pathfinder #1 demonstrated the business practice of purchasing COMSATCOM with the procurement of two Ku-band transponders over Africa. Although achieving its goals for affordability, the purchased transponders were limited in coverage area. Addressing the coverage constraints, Pathfinder #2 is currently in the process of demonstrating a "pooled portable bandwidth" through purchase of pre-launch transponders. Transponders will be purchased pre-launch to maximize affordability, and use of those transponders will be traded for flexible satellite constellation access for the USG. Pathfinders #3, #4, and #5 will continue to refine these business development processes from the first two Pathfinders; buying transponders, pooling bandwidth across satellite constellations, and increasing the pace of bandwidth allocation while adding providers to the global pool.</p>
<p>Over the course of the initial two Pathfinders, it became apparent that other capabilities besides the bandwidth pool need to be developed to meet the Pathfinder objectives of improving affordability and resiliency. One of the areas that needs further exploration is terminal flexibility. DoD terminals must be able to "flex" from one satellite network to another for a variety of reasons; however, this is currently hindered by the proliferation of managed service networks using proprietary modems and waveform technologies. Use of a flexible modem interface (FMI) to the terminal could overcome that limitation and offer a fully global service by connecting the regional networks currently available. Other areas of exploration include, but are not limited to, efficient Government/Operator reservation and network control, automated business processes, backhaul services, and the associated development of a Concept of Operations (CONOPs) and Interface Control Documents (ICDs). Terminal flexibility is the primary focus of this RFI, specifically with the model described below in Section 2.0; however, the other topics listed are also being explored.</p>
<p>The USG is interested in industry perspectives on several of these business and technical constructs. Response to this RFI does not constitute acknowledgement of any given supplier or their approach. The USG intends to develop a flexible modem-terminal interface based on standards to be developed under the Pathfinder #3 through #5 efforts and plans. Vendors will execute hardware, software, and bandwidth (capacity) associated tasks as part of a future Request for Proposal (RFP). The USG is interested in interoperable solutions and architectures that shall not exclude any vendor(s) with regard to technical advancements, in-place bandwidth purchases, or knowledge transfer.</p>
<p>Responses to this Pathfinder #3 RFI will clarify the USG's technical, business, and procurement vision for future Pathfinder programs as well as collect information needed to manage these future programs and plan for a full operational capability following the Pathfinder efforts. It is requested that responses be provided to the attached plan/questionnaire with the appropriate markings. The USG prefers non-proprietary responses as much as possible, especially at the architecture level. This is intended to lead to a non-proprietary standard(s) generation process in which a wide variety of industry members should be able to participate. However, it is understood that some communications, particularly with respect to interfaces, may be proprietary in nature and may be allowed as a condition of participation.</p>
<p><strong>2.0 Pathfinder Operational Scenario</strong><br />The Pathfinder project is considered by Congress to be a Pilot Program, however, the goal is to have the results of the project lead to operational capability. A typical operational scenario in which the Pathfinder capabilities would be utilized includesa user exercising a communications path through a given satellite and backhaul system when any of the following might occur: (a) the system is no longer available to the user, whether due to user movement, service disruption, etc., (b) the service requirements for that user change, (c) the Government Network Operations Center (GNOC) determines the user should be moved to another service, possibly because the user has moved into the area of a more cost-effective service, as a result of a cyber-attack on the user or service provider or for some other reason, or (d) the user exceeds the contracted capacity pool for that system. Upon notice of any combination of these events, the GNOC looks for alternate capacity that meets the service level agreement (SLA) requirements of the platform then requests confirmation of available service from the target provider. This available service may potentially require a different modem from the one currently in use due to the use of proprietary waveforms, local interference in the current frequency band, or other factors. The target provider is then notified by the GNOC via a persistent ground control channel that the customer is requesting services. Depending on the system type, the remote terminal is notified in one of several possible ways: indirectly through a managed service, directly through the forward data stream, or potentially through an out-of-band controller. This notification directs the Flexible Modem Interface (FMI) to commission the terminal to the new service provider's system and establishes a specific time to decommission the current service and repoint the antenna. The ground control channel then confirms that the current session will be suspended. At the selected time, the FMI issues a repointing command to the terminal pointing processor; the new signal is acquired; the ground hub and remote terminal establish messaging and data connectivity; and finally, the terminal instructs the GNOC that the new service is active. During the changeover, the GNOC provisions backhaul capacity on the new system under the same session enabling a nearly seamless flow of data from the platform to and from the designated end-point on the ground.<br /><br />The intent of Pathfinder #3 will be to provide USG terminals and platforms with flexible access to commercial and government SATCOM capacity by providing the ability to roam between a variety of in-place satellite/hub and managed systems. A centralized management segment will communicate with each commercial and DoD Service provider's network system managers to enable a rapid system-to-system handover or roaming while maintaining session layer communications and required quality of service. For DoD systems the option exists to access the previously allocated space segment resources to individual Services (e.g. Army, Navy, and AF network resources), to include their ground hubs and network managers (NCW for Army hubs, PTW for joint protected hubs, etc.), and/or direct requests to STRATCOM/ARSTRAT for centrally managed (as depicted in the Attachment 1) satellite, teleport, and DoDIN resources. Within this RFI, government is open to contractor suggestions that may streamline or improve the current access process.</p>
<p>The Pathfinder implementation is not intended to result in the modification of any core elements of the provider's system. Pathfinder adapts to existing systems using code which integrates disparate software sets, hardware adapters, and microprocessor-enabled application program interfaces (API). Pathfinder will rely heavily on COMSATCOM service providers for end-to-end connectivity, modem providers for a standard method of switching between modems, terminal providers to support these interface standards, and a single management entity to maintain Pathfinder system operations.</p>
<p><strong>3.0 Challenges for the Government</strong> <br />There are a number of challenges to be addressed as part of the Pathfinder #3 concept. The primary challenge is the need for COMSATCOM service providers to agree to and support the network roaming concept. The greatest technical risk is associated with yet to be designed multi-modem interfaces including antenna control, the modem management information base, and a service provider to the GNOC link. The antenna control unit (ACU) and radio frequency (RF) electronics are often proprietary. While emerging standards such as the Open Antenna Modem Interface Protocol (OpenAMIP) attempt to resolve these issues, not all modem manufacturers use this standard. Also, many installed antennas/ACUs do not conform to OpenAMIP, which may require the interface to be customized to each service provider's system.</p>
<p>The second challenge involves controlling the modem. Each modem or modem manufacturer may use a different messaging approach; the GNOC must adapt to each set of modem controls and responses. Finally, the GNOC must interface with each service provider's network management system (NMS) and/or hub processor to determine capacity availability, initiate service, terminate service, assess remaining pooled resources, mediate handoffs, and define the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for each connection. The objective of this RFI is to garner industry's inputs on these challenges.</p>
<p><strong>4.0 Nominal Sequence</strong><br />Attachment 2 shows a nominal schedule for the Pathfinder series. Pathfinder #1 is currently in use and Pathfinder #2 is in the acquisition processes. Pathfinder #3 is in the design phase to study the roaming concept for future RFP. Pathfinder #4 will focus on modifying the bandwidth pooling approach to include multiple service providers. Pathfinder #5 will extend the results of an RFP to a series of demonstrations, culminating in a field demonstration using a High Capacity Satellite service. Pathfinders #4 and #5 will proceed concurrently to continue building the portable bandwidth pool while demonstrating the roaming concept.</p>
<p><strong>5.0 Instructions</strong><br />The questions included in Section 6.0 are intended for a broad set of responders. Although responders are not expected to answer every question, all responders are welcome to answer any of the attached questions. Responses to the following questions may be framed either in the context of a capability demonstration or of a full-scale operation; if appropriate, specify which context the response uses.</p>
<p><strong>6.0 Questions for Industry</strong> <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6.1 Modem Interface<br /></span>6.1.1 How would the Flexible Modem Interface (FMI) be defined (in terms of interfaces, form factor, etc.) which facilitates the multi modem operations as stated in the example scenario?<br />6.1.1.1 How would you adapt your standard terminal/modem capability to the Pathfinder capability? (i.e. interface board, API, Ethernet switch, etc.)<br />6.1.1.2 What features involved in SATCOM on the terminal system are controllable and how is it controlled? List all of the interfaces on your equipment (i.e. Power Control and Data, GPS, etc.)<br />6.1.1.3 How would/do you control the antenna? Include information on any additional interface equipment used for antenna control.<br />6.1.1.4 Describe the process used for setting up the modem (i.e. commissioning).<br />6.1.1.5 Does your modem perform autonomous operations? (i.e. can it facilitate handoff as defined in the scenario in Section 2.0?) <br />6.1.1.6 If the USG performed a flight demonstration, what terminal would you recommend using? Does the recommended terminal include multi-band capabilities? Provide configuration details.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6.2 Infrastructure</span><br />6.2.1 The infrastructure represents the data backhaul and control distribution terrestrial networks. In the event of landing the data at a commercial teleport, how would you provide transport for the mission data and control back to the DoDIN as outlined in the scenario in Section 2.0? <br />6.2.1.1 How would you design a GNOC to manage the transport described in question 6.2.1?<br />6.2.1.2 If the government were to employ end-to-end encryption, how would that impact the transport operations? How might that impact be mitigated?<br />6.2.1.3 How would you provide protect those circuits from compromise?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6.3 Control</span><br />6.3.1 What recommendations would you make for the control architecture?<br />6.3.1.1 What existing systems perform similar control functions (as outlined in the scenario in Section 2.0) which could be modified to provide Pathfinder system management?<br />6.3.1.2 The resulting capability of Pathfinder control allows the user to effectively &lsquo;roam' between competing systems. What barriers, if any, do you foresee in the execution of this strategy? How might those barriers be addressed?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6.4 Operations</span><br />6.4.1 How would you envision your system interacting with the Pathfinder network management system to achieve service activation? <br />6.4.2 The Government would like to minimize the impact to existing commercial operations. What, if anything, in this questionnaire might lead the responder to add costs to their existing system to facilitate the Pathfinder objectives? <br />&emsp;</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice
Cook's Lake Conservation Area Perimeter Maintenance

This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, management, and financial capability of such offerors to perform this type of work.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside is warranted or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.  

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 561730, entitled "Landscaping Services".  This industry comprises (1) establishments primarily engaged in providing landscape care and maintenance services and/or installing trees, shrubs, plants, lawns, or gardens and (2) establishments primarily engaged in providing these services along with the design of landscape plans and/or the construction (i.e., installation) of walkways, retaining walls, decks, fences, ponds, and similar structures.  The small business size standard for NAICS Code 561730 is $7.5 million in annual receipts.

BACKGROUND:  Cook's Lake Conservation Area (Appendix A) is a wooded wetland located approximately 1.5 miles north of the confluence of Aravaipa Creek and the San Pedro River in Pinal County, Arizona.  It was acquired by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) as part of 3 separate acquisitions between 1992 and 1997, as Clean Water Act, Section 404, mitigation for the loss of 22 acres of wetland habitat on the Agua Fria River. Marsh habitat was lost as a result of the construction of New Waddell Dam and the modification of Camp Dyer Diversion Dam. Reclamation retains ownership and management responsibility for the property.

After its purchase, fencing was constructed around most of the property to preserve wildlife and the habitat they rely on. The fencing needs to be monitored and maintained monthly to ensure it is intact to exclude cattle, horses, and other problems that can degrade habitat quality. If the fence line is breached then actions must be taken to remove all trespass cattle and horses. Northern access to the property is provided by an easement that only requires maintenance as needed. Access within the property is provided by a network of trails that needs to be maintained twice a year.

GENERAL:  The contractor shall inspect the perimeter fence line, on foot, twice a month (at 2 week intervals). Interior fences do not need to be inspected at the same frequency as the perimeter fence; but shall be inspected and repaired as necessary to maintain the integrity of the fence. The trail through the property shall be inspected and cleared April and August each year unless otherwise requested. The fence lines shall be cleared annually. The work schedule is for 1 base year with the option to extend performance for an additional 4 years (5 years total).

OBJECTIVES:
Maintenance- Minor fence repairs shall be conducted as part of the normal maintenance and shall be conducted on the day of discovery.

Major fence repairs and fence replacement shall be conducted as needed. Reclamation shall be notified and approval granted by the Contracts Officer Representative (COR) prior to initiation of major repairs. Digital images of the major repair areas shall be recorded and sent to Reclamation. Major fence repairs shall be initiated no later than 72 hours after the incident is discovered and Reclamation has been notified of and has approved of the needed repairs. Major fence replacement and repairs shall be completed within a reasonable timeframe.

The contractor shall be responsible for repairs to, or replacement of, approximately 13,512 feet of wildlife friendly 4 stranded smooth and barb wire fence, and approximately 1850 feet of 3 rail-pipe fence and an associated cattle trap as needed (Appendix B). 

All fence lines shall be kept clear of vegetation for approximately 5 feet on both sides of the fence for the purpose of monitoring and fence maintenance unless otherwise directed by the COR.  Small trees (less than 5 inch trunk diameter) and shrubs should be removed from the fence line ROW. Where possible trim tree branches rather than remove the entire tree. The Contractor shall not remove any tree with a trunk diameter of over 5 inches without prior approval of the COR. All cut vegetation must be placed a minimum 15 feet from the fence line. Cleared vegetation (small branches and bushes) may be piled in small (less than 4ft) high piles or removed from the property and disposed of at an approved landfill. Cut vegetation will not be left adjacent to the fence. Fallen trees shall be cut into lengths, no longer than 6 feet, and again placed a minimum of 15 feet from the fence line. Logs should not be stacked, but dispersed randomly. All material shall be placed within Reclamation property boundaries. Trees shall not be used as supports, posts, or braces for the fences or gates. The contractor shall furnish all materials for repair of the fences and gates. This includes posts, wire, cement, sand course aggregate, reinforcement and all necessary hardware and accessories for a complete installation and repair. All damaged fence shall be removed unless otherwise authorized by the COR. The wire, posts and all other material removed shall become property of the contractor and removed from the property and disposed of at an appropriate landfill.

Mechanical clearing (other than chainsaws) of vegetation is not permitted. Vegetation clearing will be limited to hand clearing methods only.

Trail Maintenance- The contractor shall clear and maintain approximately 1.0 mile of trail running through the property which provides access to monitoring wells. This will require semi-annual maintenance of the trail in April and August of each year. Fallen trees shall be cut back to the edge of the trail and the cut material dispersed. Specific clearing times will be coordinated through the COR.

Cattle Trespass- The contractor shall be responsible for the removal of trespass cattle from the property. Reclamation shall be notified immediately if trespass cattle are observed within Reclamation's fenced property. Cattle may be baited into the existing trap, maneuvered by dogs or removed via contractor devised, Reclamation approved methods. The cattle trap must be monitored daily when in use. The contractor will be responsible for supplying the trap with hay and water. Water may be obtained at the SRP (Salt River Project) headquarters approximately 1 mile south of the project area. The contractor shall coordinate with SRP for access to water. SRP must be notified anytime cattle trapping operations are initiated. The contractor will be responsible for contacting the Brand Inspector and making all arrangements for disposition of trespass cattle. Cattle may be returned to the lawful owner if they are branded. Cattle may be transported through adjacent landowner (American Smelting and Refining Company [ASARCO] or SRP) property only after prior notification and concurrence from the landowner. Trespass cattle must be confined within a stock trailer or other vehicle sufficiently secured to avoid escape prior to transportation through adjacent property. Cattle shall not be turned loose onto ASARCO or SRP properties.

Access and North Access Road Maintenance- Access through SRP property (south of Cook's Lake) or through ASARCO (north of Cook's Lake) has been approved through prior arrangements. The contractor will be responsible for all additional coordination required with respect to trespass cattle removal, monitoring and maintenance. The contractor will be responsible for the repair and maintenance of the north access road through ASARCO. If major repair is needed the contractor will notify Reclamation of the extent of repair and an estimate of cost for approval. 

Motorized vehicles are not permitted inside the perimeter fence line unless an exception has been preapproved by the COR. This should only be considered in an emergency (injury, fire, etc.) or an exceptional situation identified by both partners.

Reports- The contractor shall prepare monitoring reports in an Excel spreadsheet format and emailed to Reclamation monthly. The report should contain the following information (at a minimum);
-Inspection Date
-Arrival and Departure Times
-Name of inspector
-Type of repair required and location
-Date repair was completed
-Presence of trespass cattle
-Date trespass cattle were removed
-Date, contact person, and discussion synopsis for SRP or ASARCO coordination.
-Additional comments as necessary

Anticipated/Preferred Qualifications-

-Minimum of 20-years prior experience with removing trespass cattle
-Contractor shall be familiar with hydrology trends on the San Pedro River and Aravaipa Creek

GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT:  No substantial involvement on the part of the Government is anticipated for the successful completion of the objectives to be funded by this award.  It is anticipated that the Government's involvement will consist of standard federal stewardship responsibilities such as monitoring, project performance, technical assistance at the request of the recipient, etc.

<SUBJECT>Landing Craft, Utility (LCU) 1700 Draft Specification
<SOLNBR>N0002416SN032
<RESPDATE>071516
<CONTACT>Linda C. Squires, Contracting Officer, Phone 2027813942, Email linda.squires@navy.mil
<DESC><p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>THIS SPECIAL NOTICE IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) USING MARKET RESEARCH AND WILL BE USED FOR INFORMATIONAL AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). THERE IS NO FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></p>
<p>The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is issuing this Special Notice on behalf of the Amphibious Warfare Program Office (PMS377) to support the development of a potential future RFP for the Detail Design and Construction of the Landing Craft, Utility (LCU) 1700 Class of amphibious landing craft. The Government is conducting market research to gather comments and questions from Industry craft builders and designers on the draft Specification. The result of this market research will contribute to the continued development of the draft RFP.</p>
<p>In earlier RFIs (N0002412SNA72, N0002413SN08A, N0002413SN09A, N0002415SN005, N0002415SN009, N0002415SN010, N0002415SN012, and N0002416SN006), Industry provided the Government input on yard design and construction capabilities, the pros and cons of the use of a Build to Print approach with a Government-provided Detail Design, and technical market research questions.</p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE:</strong></p>
<p>This Special Notice seeks input from interested parties capable of performing detailed design and/or construction for up to thirty-two (32) LCU 1700 craft. Landing craft are included in the US Munitions List and therefore subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulations restrictions. Therefore, any interested parties must comply with all U.S. export control laws and regulations.</p>
<p><strong>ANTICIPATED SCOPE OF WORK:</strong></p>
<p>The type of work to be accomplished under a potential future LCU 1700 contract would include the development of a detail design based on a modified performance specification requirements and Contract Drawings and Data. The term "modified" is used to indicate that the specification would not be a pure performance specification; due to the unique dimensional restraints required by the need to enter and exit existing well decks, and the learning provided by the Government's Preliminary Design effort, some additional non-performance requirements would be provided in the specification.</p>
<p>If a future solicitation is eventually released, the future contract awardee would be responsible for the design and integration of hull, machinery, electrical, electronic, navigation, habitability and piping systems, as well as integration of gun mount foundations and a Government-furnished communications suite into the vessel. Requirements would also include test plan development, logistics support, technical manual development, and Earned Value Management System reporting.</p>
<p><strong>LCU 1700 CHARACTERISTICS:</strong></p>
<p>The basic characteristics of the LCU 1700 Indicative Design include:</p>
<p>a. Hull: Steel construction<br />1. Service life of at least 30 years<br />2. Capable of repeated beach landings without structural damage<br />b. Length: approximately 139 feet<br />c. Beam: approximately 31 feet<br />d. Light Ship Displacement: approximately 256 long tons<br />e. Full load displacement: approximately 428 long tons<br />f.

Max Speed: 11 knots<br />j. Endurance at Sustained Speed: 1200 NM at 8 knots with a 170 short tons of payload<br />k. Bow ramp and stern gate for drive-through capability<br />l. Habitability for 10 days underway<br />1. Crew accommodations for 14 personnel (mixed gender)<br />2. Habitability and provisioning support<br />m. Stern anchor with diesel engine hydraulic power unit (HPU) and hydraulic winch<br />n. Capable of operating in Sea State 3 seas; survivable in Sea State 5<br />o. Redundant critical systems (engines, generators, switchboards, fire pumps)<br />p. 4 machine gun mounts capable of accepting US Navy crew served weapons<br />q. Capable of being transported in current and planned amphibious warships without requiring any modification to the warships<br />r.

<p><br />DISCUSSIONS   <br />The Government intends to award a contract without discussions.  Offerors should provide their best, complete proposal upon initial submission.  The Government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.</p>
<p><br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2014) this provision has been tailored to this procurement and is provided in full-text below:</p>
<p>52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)</p>
<p>(1)	(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. <br />Award will be based on the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable having Acceptable Past Performance.</p>
<p><br />The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) Technical. Offeror's technical proposal should clearly reflect how the offeror proposes to comply with the performance required and identified in the Statement of Work.  To be found technically acceptable Offeror must propose the brand name Predator DNC System or equivalent. Offeror must be proposing the requested brand name or equal equipment that will meet the minimum performance and delivery requirements outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW). Offeror's technical approach, including any supporting documentation, is to be clear and concise and should clearly reference the Scope, Requirements and Functional Task Requirements identified in the Statement of Work.  This evaluation will result in a determination of technical acceptability or unacceptability. Exceeding the technical requirements will not result in a more favorable evaluation since the overall technical evaluation will be Acceptable/Unacceptable.</p>
<p>Offeror's technical proposal including any supporting documentation shall be clear and concise. Technical proposals should not just be a parroting of the requirement. Offerors shall use descriptive and explanatory elements in addressing all elements. A single statement of Offeror compliance will not be accepted in lieu of an explanatory description and shall disqualify the Offeror from contract award consideration. Proposals that do not address all elements in the noted Sections individually may not be reviewed and may not be given contract award consideration. Include specification and data sheets for proposed DNC System and enclosures.</p>
<p>Technical factors will include the following sub-factors:</p>
<p>A. Capability of meeting the required minimum specifications of the SOW</p>
<p>B. Evidence of a current approved (not expired) Certificate of Networthiness (CoN) or evidence that an application has been submitted for renewal at time of Proposal Submission.</p>
<p>C. Capability of meeting the SOW Delivery and Installation requirements.</p>
<p>D. Capability of meeting the SOW Warranty and Support Requirement.</p>
<p>E. Ability to meet the SOW training requirements.</p>
<p>G. Offeror must provide a statement in the technical proposal submitted that Offeror has read, understands and will fully comply with all the requirements in the SOW.</p>
<p><br />(2) Price. Offerors are advised to provide the most competitive pricing they can with the initial proposal submission.</p>
<p>(3) Delivery Timeframe. Offerors are advised to provide the best delivery timeframe they can with the initial proposal submission. At a minimum offerors shall meet delivery timeframes required in accordance with the SOW. Delivery timeframe will be evaluated as Acceptable/Unacceptable.</p>
<p>(4) Past Performance. Past Performance must receive an acceptable rating to be considered for award. Offerors must submit three (3) examples of past performance. The examples shall have been performed within the past three (3) years. Past performance examples will be evaluated for relevance and quality.</p>
<p>(a)	Relevance is defined as fulfilling the same or similar requirement for the same or similar services under the same or similar circumstances.</p>
<p>(b)	Quality is evaluated as overall customer satisfaction, including but not limited to: performance of the services/supplies provided; timeliness of delivery; willingness to negotiate and accommodate changes; cost control; processing of warranty claims, performance of maintenance agreements; availability of general customer support</p>
<p>(c)	Three (3) examples of past performance shall be included in the offeror's proposal. Each example shall have the following information:<br />&bull;	Contract or Sales Number<br />&bull;	Date of Sale<br />&bull;	Services provided<br />&bull;	Customer/Agency name<br />&bull;	Customer Point of Contract (POC) and position  within the   <br />Company/agency<br />&bull;	Customer POC telephone Number</p>
<p>(d)	Should the offeror provide more than three (3) examples of past performance, the Government is not obligated to contact more than the first three. Offerors should confirm that the POC telephone numbers are accurate and in service; failure to provide valid telephone numbers does not obligate the Government to further pursue those examples of past performance.</p>
<p>(e)	In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p>(f)	Nothing in this solicitation prohibits the Government from obtaining and considering past performance from any source available.</p>
<p>(g)	Negative information obtained using past performance evaluations will be provided to the offeror to be addressed unless such negative information or circumstances have already been addressed by the offeror.</p>
<p>(b) Award will be made to lowest price technically acceptable having acceptable past performance. To receive consideration for award, the Government will make an award to the responsible offeror on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors and whose offer conforms to all of the terms and conditions set forth in this solicitation.</p>
<p>Offerors must be found responsible IAW FAR 9.1.</p>
<p>Offerors are advised to provide the most competitive pricing they can with the initial proposal submission as it is anticipated that award may be made without discussions with offerors.</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1<br />ET 02-20 Authorized Workers Notice to Potential Bureau of Reclamation Contractors - (Sep 2002)<br />(a) Definitions.<br />IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986<br />INA - Immigration and Nationality Act<br />INS - Immigration and Naturalization Service<br />SSA - Social Security Administration<br />INS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program<br />ESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor)<br />(a) Authority. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.<br />(b) Who is Covered. INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination. These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.<br />(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements. Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S. The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9). Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer. Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site: http://www.uscis.gov/i-9<br />(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs. The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees. Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program. If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9.<br />(1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235.<br />(2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia. The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem. To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.<br />(3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature. If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature. To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.<br />(e) Employee Rights. The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.<br />(f) Compliance Assistance. More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.<br />(g) Penalties/Sanctions. Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions. As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms. They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment. A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings.<br />(End Provision)<br />ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1<br />WBR 1452.211-80 Notice of Intent to Acquire Metric Products and Services -- Bureau of Reclamation - (Mar 1993)<br />(a) Metric Transition Plan. The Department of the Interior on December 6, 1991, issued a Metric Transition Program (Part 758 Department Manual Chapter 1) to establish and describe the program's policies and responsibilities. The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), has developed a Metric Transition Plan to implement metrication in Reclamation. This plan describes Reclamation's overall strategy for using the metric system, defines general requirements and procedures for carrying out the transition, and details the tasks with milestones for Reclamation offices to complete.<br />(b) The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (Trade Act). <br />(1) Section 5164 of Public Law 100-418, the Trade Act, amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 and designated the metric system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce. <br />(2) The Trade Act establishes September 30, 1992, as the implementation date (to the extent economically feasible) for Federal agencies to use the metric system of measurement in its procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. <br />(3) The Trade Act permits exceptions to the use of the metric system to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms, such as when foreign competitors are producing competing products in non-metric units.<br />(4) As a result of the Trade Act, the President issued Executive Order 12770 dated July 25, 1991, to implement the congressional designation of the metric system as the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce.<br />(c) Bureau of Reclamation Implementation. As a result of the Trade Act, Reclamation will, to the maximum extent practicable, use hard conversion and soft conversion metric systems in designing its construction projects, eventually phasing out use of the soft conversion metric system. Exceptions to this policy will only be made when such use is impractical, produces inefficiencies or market losses, or is not economically feasible.<br />(d) Expected Results. Reclamation expects its support of the metric system to result in increased use of the metric system by U.S. contractors, thereby increasing their ability to compete in the international marketplace. Increasing use of the metric system by U.S. contractors will eliminate possible restrictions on their bidding in the international marketplace and will eliminate any impact of economic blocks by metric countries restricting the acceptance of non-metric products.<br />(End provision)<br />ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1<br />1452.215-71 Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information--Department of the Interior - (Apr 1984)<br />(a) Definitions.

The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the Government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract."<br />(c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend:<br />"This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal."<br />(d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another source without restriction it may be used without restriction.<br />(e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so.

However, failure of an offeror to mark information contained in a proposal as trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information will be treated by the Government as evidence that the information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, absent a showing that the failure to mark was due to unusual or extenuating circumstances, such as a showing that the offeror had intended to mark, but that markings were omitted from the offeror's proposal due to clerical error.<br />(End Provision)<br />ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1<br />WBR 1452.222-80 Notice of Applicability--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies - Child Labor--Bureau of Reclamation - (Jan 2004)<br />(a) The clause at FAR 52.222-19, Child Labor, Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, does not apply to Bureau of Reclamation acquisitions to the extent that the contractor is supplying end products mined, produced, or manufactured in -<br />(1) Canada, and the anticipated value of the acquisition is $175,000 or more; and<br />(2) Israel, and the anticipated value of the acquisition is $175,000 or more.<br />(b) Nonapplicability thresholds for other countries are the same as listed in the FAR clause.<br />(End of Provision)<br /><br />By the provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, lowest price technically acceptable will be the evaluation factor used for this requirement.

<p>SECTION H - SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>H.1. OBSERVANCE OF LEGAL HOLIDAYS AND ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE (GOVERNMENT FACILITIES PERFORMANCE) (JAN 2000)<br />(a) Holidays</p>
<p>Government personnel shall observe the following listed days as holidays:</p>
<p>Washington's Birthday<br />Memorial Day<br />Independence Day<br />Labor Day<br />Veterans' Day<br />Thanksgiving Day<br />Christmas Day<br />New Year's Day<br />Columbus Day<br />Martin Luther King Day</p>
<p>Any other day designated by Federal Statute<br />Any other day designated by Executive Order<br />Any other day designated by Presidential proclamation</p>
<p>The Contractor shall observe the above holidays on the date observed by the Government. Observance of such days by Government personnel shall not "on its face" be cause for an additional period of performance, or entitlement of compensation except as set forth within the contract. Contractor employees performing duties within Government facilities are automatically relieved from duty by virtue of the fact that Government employees are dismissed early or given the day off, (with the exception of 24 hour/day service requirements). No form of holiday or other premium compensation will be reimbursed; however, this does not preclude reimbursement for authorized overtime work.</p>
<p>(b) Unscheduled Facility Closures</p>
<p>In the event the Government facilities are closed due to inclement weather, potentially hazardous conditions, and other special circumstances, contractor personnel assigned to work within those facilities are automatically dismissed. In this instance, the cost of salaries and wages for the period of any such excused absence may be charged in the same manner as the effected employee's regular time (direct cost for those employees whose salaries are normally a direct cost; indirect cost for those employees whose salaries are normally an indirect cost), provided that such charges are in accordance with the contractor's accounting system/policy. In each instance, the Contractor agrees to continue to provide sufficient personnel to perform round the clock requirements of critical tasks already in operation or scheduled, and shall be guided by the instructions issued by the Contracting Officer or his duly appointed representative.</p>

<p>I.2. CDC CLAUSES IN FULL TEXT</p>
<p>I.2.1. Evaluation of Contractor Performance (Service) (Jan 2000)</p>
<p>(a) Purpose</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 42.1502, the Contractor's performance will be periodically evaluated by the Government, in order to provide current information for source selection purposes. These evaluations will therefore be marked "Source Selection Information."</p>
<p>(b) Performance Evaluation Period</p>
<p>The Contractor's performance will be evaluated at least annually.</p>
<p>(c) Evaluators</p>
<p>The performance evaluation will be completed jointly by the COR and the Contracting officer.</p>
<p>(d) Performance Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>The contractor's performance will be evaluated in accordance with the attachment listed in Section J titled Performance Evaluation Report.</p>
<p>(e) Contractor Review</p>
<p>A copy of the evaluation will be provided to the contractor as soon as practicable after completion of the evaluation. The contractor shall submit comments, rebutting statements, or additional information to the Contracting Officer within 30 calendar days after receipt of the evaluation.</p>
<p>(f) Resolving Disagreements Between the Government and the Contractor</p>
<p>Disagreements between the parties regarding the evaluation will be reviewed at a level above the Contracting Officer. The ultimate conclusion on the performance evaluation is a decision of the contracting agency. Copies of the evaluation, contractor's response, and review comments, if any, will be retained as part of the evaluation.</p>
<p>(g) Release of Contractor Performance Evaluation Information</p>
<p>The completed evaluation will not be released to other than Government personnel and the contractor whose performance is being evaluated. Disclosure of such information could cause harm both to the commercial interest of the Government and to the competitive position of the contractor being evaluated as well as impede the efficiency of Government operations.</p>
<p>(h) Source Selection Information</p>
<p>Departments and agencies may share past performance information with other Government departments and agencies when requested to support future award decisions. The information may be provided through interview and/or by sending the evaluation and comment document to the requesting source selection official.</p>
<p>(i) Retention Period</p>
<p>The agency will retain past performance information for a maximum period of three years after completion of contract performance for the purpose of providing source selection information for future contract awards.</p>
<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p>I.2.2 Non-Disclosure Agreement for Contractor and Contractor Employees (Mar 2006)</p>
<p>(a) The contractor shall prepare and submit a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to the Contracting Officer prior to access of government information or the commencement of work at CDC.</p>
<p>(b) The NDA made part of this clause, exhibit I and II , is required in service contracts where positions and/or functions proposed to be filled by contractor's employees will have access to non-public and procurement-sensitive information. The NDA also requires contractor's employees properly identify themselves as employees of a contractor when communicating or interacting with CDC employees, employees of other governmental entities (when communication or interaction relates to the contractor's work with the CDC), and members of the public. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.114 (c), states "All contractor personnel attending meetings, answering Government telephones, and working in other situations where their contractor status is not obvious to third parties are required to identify themselves as such to avoid creating an impression in the minds of members of the public or Congress that they are Government officials, unless, in the judgment of the agency, no harm can come from failing to identify themselves. They must also ensure that all documents or reports produced by contractors are suitably marked as contractor products or that contractor participation is appropriately disclosed."</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall inform employees of the identification requirements by which they must abide and monitor employee compliance with the identification requirements.</p>
<p>(d) During the contract performance period, the Contractor is responsible to ensure that all additional or replacement contractors' employees sign a NDA and it is submitted to the Contracting Officer prior to commencement of their work with the CDC.</p>
<p>(e) Contractor employees in designated positions or functions that have not signed the appropriate NDA shall not have access to any non-public, procurement sensitive information or participate in government meeting where sensitive information may be discussed.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor shall prepare and maintain a current list of employees working under NDAs and submit to the Contracting Officer upon request during the contract period of performance. The list should at a minimum include: contract number, employee's name, position, date of hire and NDA requirement.</p>

Therefore, if an employee participates in any discussions relating to procurement-sensitive information, assists in developing any procurement-sensitive information, or otherwise obtains any procurement-sensitive information during the course of performing duties at the CDC, contractor understands and agrees that contractor are be excluded from competing for any acquisition(s) resulting from this information.</p>

<p>ATTACHMENT 2- ASSESSMENT OF CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE<br />CONTRACTORS' PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTING SYSTEM (CPARS) RATINGS<br />As required by FAR 8.406-7 Contractor Performance Evaluation, CDC will evaluate contractor performance for this task order because it exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold (see FAR 42.1502(c) Policy [Contractor Performance Information]). CDC will perform this assessment electronically at least annually or as required by www.cpars.gov.<br />1. Block 18a - Quality of Product or Service. <br />Assess the contractor's conformance to contract requirements, specifications and standards of good workmanship (e.g. commonly accepted technical, professional, environmental, or safety and health standards). MANDATORY.<br />&bull; For example: Are reports/data accurate? Does the product or service provided meet the specifications of the contract? Does the contractor's work measure up to commonly accepted technical or professional standards? Assess the degree of Government technical direction required to solve problems that arise during performance. <br />&bull; For Operations Support: Assess how successfully the contractor meets program quality objectives such as ability to produce, reliability, maintainability and ability to inspect. The Assessing Official must be flexible in how contractor success is measured (e.g. using data from field reliability and maintainability and failure reports, user comments and acceptance rates, and scrap and rework rates). These quantitative indicators may be useful later, for example, in source selection evaluations, in demonstrating continuous improvement, quality and reliability leadership that reflects progress in total quality management. Assess the contractor's control of the overall production process to include material control, shop planning and control, and status.<br />2. Block 18b - Schedule. <br />Assess the timeliness of the contractor against the completion of the contract, task orders, milestones, delivery schedules, and administrative requirements (e.g. efforts that contribute to or effect the schedule variance). MANDATORY.<br />&bull; This assessment of the contractor's adherence to the required delivery schedule should include the contractor's efforts during the assessment period that contributes to or effect the schedule variance. This element applies to contract closeout activities as well as contract performance. Instances of adverse actions such as the assessment of liquidated damages, or issuance of Cure Notices, Show Cause Notices, and Delinquency Notices are indicators of problems which may have resulted in variance to the contract schedule and should therefore be noted in the evaluation.<br />3. Block 18c - Cost Control (Not required for Firm Fixed Price or Fixed Price with Economic Adjustment)<br />4. Block 18d - Business Relations. <br />Assess the integration and coordination of all activity needed to execute the contract, specifically the timeliness, completeness and quality of problem identification, corrective action plans, proposal submittals, the contractor's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior (to include timely identification of issues in controversy), customer satisfaction, timely award and management of subcontracts. MANDATORY<br />Include, as applicable, information on the following: <br />&bull; Is the contractor oriented toward the customer? <br />&bull; Is interaction between the contractor and the government satisfactory or does it need improvement? <br />&bull; Include the adequacy of the contractor's accounting, billing, and estimating systems and the contractor's management of Government Property (GFP) if a substantial amount of GFP has been provided to the contractor under the contract. <br />&bull; Address the timeliness of awards to subcontractors and management of subcontractors, including subcontract costs. Consider efforts taken to ensure early identification of subcontract problems and the timely application of corporate resources to preclude subcontract problems from impacting overall prime contractor performance. <br />&bull; Assess the prime contractor's effort devoted to managing subcontracts and whether subcontractors were an integral part of the contractor's team. <br />5. Block 18e - Management of Key Personnel (For Services and Information Technology Business Sectors only - Not Applicable to Operations Support). <br />Assess the contractor's performance in selecting, retaining, supporting, and replacing, when necessary, key personnel. MANDATORY.<br />&bull; For example, how well did the contractor match the qualifications of the key position, as described in the contract, with the person who filled the key position? Did the contractor support key personnel so they were able to work effectively? If a key person did not perform well, what action was taken by the contractor to correct this? If a replacement of a key person was necessary, did the replacement meet or exceed the qualifications of the position as described in the contract schedule?<br />6. Block 18f - Utilization of Small Business. <br />FAR Subpart 19.7 and 15 U.S.C. 637 contains statutory requirements for complying with the Small Business Subcontracting Program. Assess whether the contractor provided maximum practicable opportunity for Small Business (including Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) and Indian Tribes) (including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (which also includes ANCs and Indian Tribes), Women Owned Small Businesses, HUBZone, Veteran Owned, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Historically Black Colleges and Minority Institutions and ANCs and Indian Tribes that are not Small Disadvantaged Businesses or Small Businesses) to participate in contract performance consistent with efficient performance of the contract.<br />Assess compliance with all terms and conditions in the contract relating to Small Business participation (including FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Businesses and FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan (when required)). Assess any small business participation goals which are stated separately in the contract. Assess achievement on each individual goal stated within the contract or subcontracting plan including good faith effort if the goal was not achieved.<br />It may be necessary to seek input from the Small Business specialist, ACO or PCO in regards to the contractor's compliance with these criteria. For contracts subject to a commercial subcontracting plan, the Utilization of Small Business factor should be rated "satisfactory" as long as an approved plan remains in place, unless liquidated damages have been assessed by the contracting officer who approved the commercial plan (see FAR 19.705-7(h)). In such case, the Utilization of Small Business area must be rated "unsatisfactory."<br />This area must be rated for all contracts and task orders that contain a small business subcontracting goal.<br />Ratings for the Utilization of Small Business evaluation area will be in accordance with the definitions described below. Ratings for the other CPAR evaluation areas will be in accordance with the ratings described in Block 18 Evaluation Areas.<br />In accordance FAR 19.705-2(e) a contract may have no more than one subcontracting plan. Evaluations of the Utilization of Small Business are required for contracts and orders placed against basic ordering agreement (BOA) and blanket purchase agreement (BPA) if a subcontracting plan is required. Evaluations of Utilization of Small Business for single-agency task orders and delivery orders (to include FSS) are not required and shall not be accomplished unless the contracting officer determines that such evaluations would produce more useful past performance information for source selection officials than that contained in the overall contract evaluation. Execution of any subcontracting plan may be addressed in block 20.<br />&bull; Exceptional. Exceeded all negotiated subcontracting goals or exceeded at least one goal and met all of the other negotiated subcontracting goals for the current period. Had exceptional success with initiatives to assist, promote, and utilize small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business (VOSB) and service disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB). Complied with FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns. Exceeded any other small business participation requirements incorporated in the contract, including the use of small businesses in mission critical aspects of the program. Went above and beyond the required elements of the subcontracting plan and other small business requirements of the contract. Completed and submitted Individual Subcontract Reports and/or Summary Subcontract Reports in an accurate and timely manner. <br />Note: To justify an Exceptional rating, identify multiple significant events and state how they were a benefit to small business utilization. A singular benefit, however, could be of such magnitude that it constitutes an Exceptional rating. Ensure that small businesses are given meaningful, innovative work directly related to the project, rather than peripheral work, such as cleaning offices, supplies, landscaping, etc. Also, there should have been no significant weaknesses identified.<br />&bull; Very Good. Met all of the negotiated subcontracting goals in the traditional socio-economic categories (SB, SDB and WOSB) and met at least one of the other socio-economic goals (HUBZone, VOSB, SDVOSB) for the current period. Had significant success with initiatives to assist, promote and utilize SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB. Complied with FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns. Met or exceeded any other small business participation requirements incorporated in the contract, including the use of small businesses in mission critical aspects of the program. Endeavored to go above and beyond the required elements of the subcontracting plan. Completed and submitted Individual Subcontract Reports and/or Summary Subcontract Reports in an accurate and timely manner. <br />Note: To justify a Very Good rating, identify a significant event and state how they were a benefit to small business utilization. Ensure that small businesses are given meaningful, innovative work directly related to the project, rather than peripheral work, such as cleaning offices, supplies, landscaping, etc. There should be no significant weaknesses identified.<br />&bull; Satisfactory. Demonstrated a good faith effort to meet all of the negotiated subcontracting goals in the various socio-economic categories for the current period. Complied with FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns. Met any other small business participation requirements included in the contract. Fulfilled the requirements of the subcontracting plan included in the contract. Completed and submitted Individual Subcontract Reports and/or Summary Subcontract Reports in an accurate and timely manner. <br />Note: To justify a Satisfactory rating, there should have been only minor problems, or major problems the contractor has addressed or taken corrective action. There should have been no significant weaknesses identified. A fundamental principle of assigning ratings is that contractors will not be assessed a rating lower than Satisfactory solely for not performing beyond the requirements of the contract.<br />&bull; Marginal. Deficient in meeting key subcontracting plan elements. Deficient in complying with FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns, and any other small business participation requirements in the contract. Did not submit Individual Subcontract Reports and/or Summary Subcontract Reports in an accurate or timely manner. Failed to satisfy one or more requirements of a corrective action plan currently in place; however, does show an interest in bringing performance to a satisfactory level and has demonstrated a commitment to apply the necessary resources to do so. Required a corrective action plan. <br />Note: To justify Marginal performance, identify a significant event that the contractor had trouble overcoming and how it impacted small business utilization. A Marginal rating should be supported by referencing the actions taken by the government that notified the contractor of the contractual deficiency.</p>
<p>&bull; Unsatisfactory. Noncompliant with FAR 52.219-8 and 52.219-9 and any other small business participation requirements in the contract. Did not submit Individual Subcontract Reports and/or Summary Subcontract Reports in an accurate or timely manner. Showed little interest in bringing performance to a satisfactory level or is generally uncooperative. Required a corrective action plan. <br />Note: To justify an Unsatisfactory rating, identify multiple significant events that the contractor had trouble overcoming and state how it impacted small business utilization. A singular problem, however, could be of such serious magnitude that it alone constitutes an Unsatisfactory rating. An Unsatisfactory rating should be supported by referencing the actions taken by the government to notify the contractor of the deficiencies. When an Unsatisfactory rating is justified, the contracting officer must consider whether the contractor made a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of the subcontracting plan required by FAR 52.219-9 and follow the procedures outlined in FAR 52.219-16, Liquidated Damages-Subcontracting Plan.<br />NOTE 1: Plus or minus signs may be used to indicate an improving (+) or worsening (-) trend insufficient to change assessment status.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: Generally, zero percent is not a goal unless the Contracting Officer determined when negotiating the subcontracting plan that no subcontracting opportunities exist in a particular socio-economic category. In such cases, the contractor shall be considered to have met the goal for any socio-economic category where the goal negotiated in the plan was zero.<br />7. Block 18g - Other Areas. <br />Specify additional evaluation areas that are unique to the contract, or that cannot be captured elsewhere on the form. More than one type of entry may be included, but should be separately labeled. If extra space is needed, use Block 20.<br />If the contract contains an award fee provision, enter "award fee" in the "Other Areas" block (18g). The Assessing Official should translate the award fee earned to adjective ratings, which could prove more useful for using past performance to assess future performance risk in upcoming source selections. If award fee information is included in the CPAR, use block 20 to provide a description for each award fee. Include the scope of the award fee by describing the extent to which it covers the total range of contract performance activities, or is restricted to certain elements of the contract.<br />If any other type of contract incentive is included in the contract (excluding contract shareline incentives on fixed price or cost-type contracts), it should be reported in a manner similar to the procedures described above for award fee.<br />Use Block 18g in those instances where the Assessing Official believes strongly, either positively or negatively, regarding an aspect of the contractor's performance, but cannot fit that aspect into any of the other blocks on the form.</p>

Typical MCC Compacts include projects in agriculture and irrigation; energy; transport infrastructure; land rights; health; and education.

<p><strong>5)</strong> THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR AN INDEPENDENT INDIVIDUAL CONSULTANT (NOT FIRMS) AND IS NOT FOR INDIVIDUALS SEEKING EMPLOYMENT DIRECTLY WITH MCC. PLEASE VISIT: http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Independent-Contractor-Defined FOR INFORMATION REGARDING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. Note: MCC will assist the consultant in coordinating with an Independent Contractor Engagement Services Provider for payroll, travel, international travel insurance, etc., therefore, a DUNS number and registration in System for Award Management (SAM) is not required.</p>
<p><strong>Description of Services:</strong> The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has a requirement for application of the Porter Diamond model related to its assessment of the competitive microeconomic environment in Mongolia. The assessment is intended to help assess the competitiveness of a variety of productive sectors to inform a program for MCC funding. The goal of this effort is to identify both sector and national issues that constrain the growth of non-mining sectors. The objective of the program is the achievement of a sustainable reduction of macroeconomic vulnerability by removing barriers to growth in non-mining sectors. The assessment and recommendations for program support will, among other factors, inform MCC's investment decision.</p>
<p>In December 2014, the MCC Board of Directors selected Mongolia to receive assistance from MCC under a second compact. As the first step toward developing a compact program, a team consisting of economists, private sector specialists, and social and gender specialists from the Government of Mongolia (GoM) and MCC completed a constraints to growth diagnostic study. The study identified, among other things, "a weak and unstable macroeconomic environment" and "inconsistent laws and policies resulting in an unpredictable business environment" as binding constraints to growth and private investment in Mongolia. To address these constraints, the GoM and MCC are considering a program which might achieve economic diversification through cross-cutting investments in support of the sustainable growth in productive industries outside of the mining sector. A 5-year compact is expected to be signed in late 2017.</p>
<p>In 2008, with World Bank support, Dr. Michael Porter, founder of the Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness (ISC) at Harvard University, made a presentation in Mongolia on national competitiveness. As part of this presentation, he elaborated upon Mongolia's "national competitive diamond". In 2009, the World Bank and ISC prepared a scoping document for a national competitiveness program entitled, "Mongolia: Building a National Value Proposition for Competitiveness Scoping Report". The scoping document included cluster diamonds in a variety of sectors and outlined a preliminary public investment program that would support national competitiveness. However, a national competitiveness program was not implemented.</p>
<p>In December 2015, the GoM submitted a conceptual program to MCC that would address the identified constraints to growth through a program for economic diversification. Although not explicitly articulated, the objectives and conceptual program appear consistent with a program for national competitiveness. Thus, as a next step, MCC requests an assessment of the current state of national competitiveness relative to the scoping document prepared in 2009. More specifically, MCC requests a more current assessment of changes in national and cluster competitiveness since the scoping document was prepared in 2009, including: 1) Mongolia's "national competitive diamond", 2) the status and quality of "clusters" in identified clusters, 3) the availability and quality of competitive strategy analyses, including "cluster diamond" analyses, 4) the availability and quality of cluster policies, strategies, and/or roadmaps, and 5) the status of implementation of initiatives and projects that might support growth in one or more of these clusters, with an emphasis on cross-cutting initiatives. As a product of the assessment, MCC seeks an updated assessment and scoping document based on the Porter Diamond model, to further include a recommended "shortlist" of cross-cutting initiatives that MCC could support. <br />This combined synopsis and solicitation notice is a request for competitive quotations. Therefore, all quotations received prior to the RFQ close date will be considered.<br /><br /><strong>6)</strong> The Government will award an order to the responsible independent consultants(s) whose quote conforming to this notice represents the best value in terms of technical criteria, past performance and price.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1)  [  ]  Are, [  ]  are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2)  [  ]  Have, [  ]  have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3)  [  ]  Are, [  ]  are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4)  [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. section 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. section 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. section 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. section 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA/OAR/ARL/ATDD, plans to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1,  in support of the NOAA ARL Atmospheric Mercury Network (AMNet).
<p>ARL requests that the equipment described below be acquired using a noncompetitive procurement in support of OAR requirement for atmospheric chemical monitoring. ARL conducts short- and long-term research field intensives, as well as multi-year monitoring efforts to investigate source-receptor relationships in the atmosphere; characterize emission sources; study air-surface exchange processes responsible for pollutant removal; and document trends in atmospheric concentrations of important toxic pollutants.  Under the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, Congress mandated NOAA and the EPA to monitor levels of mercury in the atmosphere. ARL's research and monitoring activities fulfill that mandate and support NOAA's Strategic Plan for Weather and Water research.</p>
<p>Purchase of Tekran Model 2537X Continuous Mercury Vapor Analyzer (Quantity 1)</p>
<p>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>NOAA/ARL requires a device that meets the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. The analyzer shall be a compact, self-contained, rack mountable unit, complete with internal pump, user-serviceable pre-concentration gold traps, heaters, mass-flow meter &amp; controllers, a cold vapor atomic fluorescence detector, and calibration source. It must be a portable unit that may be used indoors or in the field to monitor background vapor-phase mercury levels to a detection level in the *sub-ng/m3* regime at a cycle time of 5 minutes or less.<br />2. The analyzer must be capable of operation without an external data-logger or computer, and should possess analog, digital and RS-232 outputs to allow it to be integrated with a serial data-logger, PC-based data system or any air quality telemetry system.<br />3. The analyzer must be equipped with dual, gold-column amalgamation cartridges to collect mercury vapor, thus allowing for continuous sampling of an air stream, with no gaps in the data collected. While one cartridge is sampling ambient air the other is in the process of being analyzed.<br />4. The mercury vapor collection cartridges should be made of pure gold, and should be able to withstand many thousands of sampling and desorption cycles without degradation in performance.<br />5. The duty cycle must be sufficiently short as to allow for near-real-time data collection, with a minimum rate of not more than 2.5 minutes per cycle.<br />6. The analyzer must be equipped with an internal mercury calibration source that allows the instrument to re-calibrate itself automatically; thus allowing unattended operation for extended periods of time.<br />7. The analyzer must be equipped with a bypass valve that prevents contaminated air from coming in contact with the detector, thus making cleaning operations infrequent.<br />8. The detector in the analyzer must have an inert gas purge feature to improve stability, thus necessitating only infrequent adjustments to the GAIN and SENSITIVITY controls.<br />9. The analyzer must utilize an electronic mass-flow meter or controller to measure ambient air sample flow rate.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-16-Q-500021 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-88 effective 16 May 2016.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,250 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Sagem Avionics, LLC as a result of this synopsis/solicitation for the following parts:</p>
<p>TEST SET, ACT / TRIM / FEEL<br />P/N: 418-65037-004<br />LSN: 4920-01-HS1-9210<br />QTY: 7 EA<br />MFGCD: 003T0<br />RDD: 09/30/16</p>
<p>All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Sagem Avionics, LLC (Cage Code 003T0). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that Sagem Avionics, LLC is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation.</p>
<p><br />No alternate part numbers will be accepted. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.</p>

Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>

<p>NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED. ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>
<p>NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product</p>

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

Performance evaluations will be prepared in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), which is a web-based system. The Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) was previously used, and CPARS is now the current platform. Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7, Chapter 6 has not been updated, as yet to reflect this change. Past performance evaluations shall be prepared for each architect-engineer services contract of $35,000 or more. A final evaluation will be prepared for each task order exceeding $35,000.00. For this procurement, the evaluation shall be prepared after acceptance of the A-E product on each task order. Past performance evaluations may also be prepared for contracts below $35,000. After an evaluation (interim or final) is written up by the USACE, the contractor will have the ability to access, review and comment on the evaluation for a period of 30 days. Accessing and using CPARS requires specific software, called PKI certification, which is installed on the user's computer. The certification is a Department of Defense requirement and was implemented to provide security in electronic transaction. The certification software could cost approximately $100-$120 per certificate per year and is purchased from External Certificate Authorities (ECA) vendors. Current information about the PKI certification process and for contracting vendors can be found on the web site http://www.cpars.gov. If the contractor wishes to participate in the performance evaluation process, access to CPARS and PKI certification is the sole responsibility of the Contractor.</p>

<DESC><strong>PLEASE SEE THE HIGHLIGHTED LINES BELOW FOR ANY CHANGES TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, THE DUE DATE IS EXTENDED UNTIL WEDNESDAY 25 MAY 2016. <br /></strong><br />1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Up to two firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. A-E services are required to provide the full spectrum of design disciplines on all or portions of Civil Works projects. The primary emphasis of A-E services will focus on Civil Works Projects; however, design services may also include construction phase services (CPS), Military Construction (MILCON) and Hazardous Toxic Radiological Waste (HTRW) projects. Task orders issued under this contract may range in scope from a small study to a new project design for Civil Works projects. The design services may include design of new facilities and/or modification/improvement of existing facilities. Demolition of existing facilities may require provisions for abatement of asbestos and/or lead based paint removal to be included in the design documents which in turn would require A-E investigation to be done. A specific scope of work and services will be issued with each task order.
<p>This procurement will be conducted under FSC Code: C219; SIC Code: 8711; NAICS Code: 541330. The size standard for this code is $15,000,000.00. To be considered a Small Business under this NAICS Code, the respondent's average revenue for the last three fiscal years cannot be more than $15,000,000.00. Up to two contracts will be negotiated and will be awarded within one year after the required response date to this announcement. Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts will be negotiated. These contracts will be for a period of performance of up to five (5) years, consisting of a base contract period of three (3) years and an option to extend the contract term by an additional two (2) years. This MATOC will have a combined capacity of $10,000,000.00. The full $10,000,000.00 will be available for the base year and any remaining funds will carry over once the option year is exercised. The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Since more than one contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement for the same or similar work, selection for task order awards will be made as follows: (1) All awardees will be given a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order award in excess of $2,500. (2) In making selection of the awardee to receive a specific task order, the Contracting Officer will consider past performance of previous task orders, quality of previous task orders, timeliness of previous task orders, cost control, the firm's strength and previous experience in relation to the work requirements and geographic location described in the statement of work for each task order. Details of the selection process will be included in the resultant contracts. All interested Architect-Engineers are reminded that in accordance with the provisions of FAR Sections 19.7, 52.219-8, 52.219-9 or equivalent DFARS Sections, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged business. The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.1) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to employee's office location (not the location of the work). To be eligible for contract award a firm or joint venture must be registered in the System For Award Management (SAM). Register via the Internet Site at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Contractor Performance Evaluations: In accordance with the provisions of Subpart 36.604 (Performance Evaluation of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), A-E contractors performance shall be evaluated throughout the performance of the contract. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) follows the procedures outlined in Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7 to fulfill this FAR requirement. Performance evaluations will be prepared in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), which is a web-based system. The Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) was previously used, and CPARS is now the current platform. Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7, Chapter 6 has not been updated, as yet to reflect this change. Past performance evaluations shall be prepared for each architect-engineer services contract of $35,000 or more. A final evaluation will be prepared for each task order exceeding $35,000.00. For this procurement, the evaluation shall be prepared after acceptance of the A-E product on each task order. Past performance evaluations may also be prepared for contracts below $35,000. After an evaluation (interim or final) is written up by the USACE, the contractor will have the ability to access, review and comment on the evaluation for a period of 30 days. Accessing and using CPARS requires specific software, called PKI certification, which is installed on the user's computer. The certification is a Department of Defense requirement and was implemented to provide security in electronic transaction. The certification software could cost approximately $100-$120 per certificate per year and is purchased from External Certificate Authorities (ECA) vendors. Current information about the PKI certification process and for contracting vendors can be found on the web site http://www.cpars.gov. If the contractor wishes to participate in the performance evaluation process, access to CPARS and PKI certification is the sole responsibility of the Contractor.</p>

<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>11. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Donald.r.dean@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>

<DESC>The following further questions were received:
<p>Question: "Decant" means dump liquids only. Does this imply no solids can be disposed of in lagoon? If so, we would need to find a landfill nearby and work on permitting, etc. to take off base. <br />Government Response: We will allow the vendor to dump solids on base.</p>
<p>Question: In regards to a map, it sounds like one won't be available even once job starts? If this is the case: Response: Yes, no plans.</p>
<p>Question: 1.) will there be an on-site representative who will be able to point out the manholes? <br />Response: Yes we have all the manholes located and identified<br />Question: 2.) would the USDA be interested in being provided a gis file (shape file) containing manholes and pipes derived from submeter locating of the manholes and televising while we were on site? <br />Response: No we just had an Alpha survey completed</p>
<p>Question: I can provide more detail about this if interested. <br />Response: None needed<br />(end)</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office has a requirement for removal and replacement of an existing expansion joint for the Senator Wash Penstock. Senator Wash Reservoir is located 18 miles northeast of Yuma on the California side of the Colorado River. It was constructed in 1966 as an off-stream regulating reservoir to provide temporary storage of excess Colorado River flows and released back into Squaw Lake when additional water is needed for irrigation deliveries. Water is pumped into the reservoir and released back into Squaw Lake by six pump-turbine units through a 195-foot long 10-foot diameter steel pressure pipe, which penetrates the embankment. The steel pipe is installed within a 15-foot diameter concrete conduit. The work associated with the Senator Wash Penstock includes removal and replacement of the existing expansion joint, supplying and installing a new custom fabricated expansion joint, removal of non-hazardous and hazardous coatings, recoating of the pipe with an approved coating and the installation of new steel pipe onto six existing air valves. Access to the work location is through a conduit access house, with man openings to climb down to each side of the steel pipe (confined space). Removal of the existing expansion joint will required it to be cut and removed in smaller sections. Once the existing expansion joint is removed, cleaning of the steel pipe will be required to remove any corroded areas on the interior and exterior of the pipe. This requirement will be a competitive, 100% Set-Aside for Small Businesses. There will be no public bid opening as competitive proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.101-2, Lowest Price, Technically Acceptable source selection process. The resultant award will result in a firm fixed-price construction contract. The services to be procured are classified in the North American Industry Classification System code 237110, Water and Sewer Line and Related Structures Construction. The Small Business Size Standard is $36.5 Million for this NAICS. The magnitude of construction is between $100,000.00 and $250,000.00. The project period of performance is anticipated to begin on or about August 1, 2016, with an anticipated completion date of November 30, 2016. All dates in this notice are estimates and are subject to change. The solicitation and any amendments to the solicitation will be available through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) (www.fedbizopps.gov) website. The extent of the work will be described in the solicitation when it is posted on or about May 1, 2016, under Solicitation number R16PS00294. No other information will be available before the solicitation is posted. NOTE: The Solicitation will be issued electronically, as will any amendments thereto, in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.5 and 5.102(a)(1); therefore, hard copies will not be provided. There will not be any printed or hard copies of the Solicitation mailed. Additionally, most public libraries have resources available to electronically access and download the Solicitation. Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is in fact unable to maintain a bidders list.

Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals may render your proposal nonresponsive and result in rejection of the same.

If a Request for Proposal is issued for subject requirement, the Government anticipates releasing the solicitation sometime in the 4th Quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2016.</p>
<p>An RFI was posted back in March 2016 for the Hill AFB Performance Work Statement (PWS) that is attached to this RFI. The potential requirement has expanded from the Hill AFB site to a potential indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract. The intent is to setup IDIQ in which the Government could place task orders for multiple locations throughout the continental United States (CONUS).</p>
<p>Attachment 1 represents the base Network Infrastructure Support Services IDIQ PWS. Attachment 2 is the Hill AFB PWS; this PWS is representative of the type of task orders that would be place on the potential Network Infrastructure Support Services IDIQ contract. Attachment 3 Site Address List- CONUS, represents potential locations of task orders that would be place under the Network Infrastructure Support Services IDIQ contract. Please see the attached documents for a description of the requirement.</p>

<p>Requested Information:<br />1. Would your company be interested in submitting an offer to provide the services described in the attached Draft PWSs?<br />2.

Would your company be able to submit an offer without visiting the site utilizing the PWS and a rough order of magnitude (ROM) that will be provided with the solicitation?<br />4. Would your company be able to simultaneously handle multiple task orders similar to the task order provided? This is to include task orders that could be located throughout the Continental United States. <br />5. Would your company be able to submit a Firm-Fixed Priced offer for this requirement?<br />6. If the Government requires offerors on any resultant solicitation to conduct a site survey (at the offerors expense) prior to submitting an offer, will your company be willing and able to conduct a site survey (at your company's expense) prior to submitting an offer? The Government will not reimburse any unsuccessful offerors the cost of the site survey.</p>
<p>Responses: <br />If you are interested in offering on such an opportunity please provide a response by 6:00 PM Eastern on June 1, 2016 to Anthony Piccari (Anthony.Piccari@dla.mil). Please have the subject of the email response read "Network Infrastructure Support Services IDIQ RFI".</p>

<p>The Finger Lakes National Forest (FLNF) plans to award no more than&nbsp;four General Construction IDIQ Contracts for small construction projects located within the Finger Lakes National Forest. By design, an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract allows the Government to respond to various emergencies and light construction needs rapidly, without committing to a specific quantity or type of work. The contractors that receive an IDIQ contract award will then compete for work when it is identified on individual task orders throughout the life of the contract.</p>
<p>The project includes, but is not limited to, the following work: road construction and re-construction, emergency road construction due to major emergencies such as landslides, flooding, fire, etc; road and/or parking area construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, maintenance, decommissioning; fencing installation and removal; trail construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, maintenance, and decommissioning; culvert installation and repair; road/stream interaction projects; pond dyke and outlet structure repairs, replacement and maintenance; aquatic organism passage projects, erosion control, sign installation and repair; gate fabrication, installation and repair including minor concrete forming and finishing; recreational site construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, and maintenance; material haul; haul and placement of imported borrow or aggregate; small building repairs (roofing, siding, rot repair, etc.) and demolition, and other related road work as described in the Statement of Work under each individual Task Order issued under this contract.

<p>The work is located within the FLNF in the State of New York.</p>
<p>Each IDIQ issued as a result of this solicitation will have a minimum guarantee of $5,000.00 over the life of the contract. Each contract will have a maximum value of $500,000.00 over the life of the contract. The life of each IDIQ will include one base year and two option years.</p>
<p>Solicitation materials will be uploaded to this site on or about 18 February 2016. This will include maps, specifications, and all materials in order to submit an offer.</p>
<p>Interested parties are advised that registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) database is required prior to award of a contract. There is no cost for registration in SAM when registration is completed on the official SAM website (www.sam.gov).</p>

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) and Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) plans to procure on a sole source basis a series of meeting rooms during the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2016 Annual Meeting from Hilton Hotels Chicago, 720 South Michigan Avenue, Chicago, IL 60605.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System code is 721110 and the business size standard is $32.2 Million.</p>
<p>Period of performance is June 2, 2016 through June 6, 2016.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The mission of CTEP is to improve the lives of cancer patients by finding better ways to treat, control and cure cancer. CTEP accomplishes this mission by funding an extensive national program of cancer research and by sponsoring clinical trials to evaluate new anti-cancer agents, with a particular emphasis on translational research to elucidate molecular targets and mechanisms of drug effects. CTEP attempts to forge broad collaborations, including international collaborations. CTEP supports NCI clinical research via networks specializing in both early and late phase clinical trials conducted with the extramural community and industry partners. The ASCO Annual Meeting brings together more than 25,000 oncology professionals from a broad range of specialties from North America as well as the rest of the world, making it an excellent venue for CTEP program staff overseeing NCI-supported clinical trials to meet and discuss the latest clinical research findings in cancer. The venue of meetings at ASCO allows an unparalleled opportunity for NCI staff to address key issues affecting NCI programs and to make decisions regarding strategy, prioritization of research questions, and study operations related to ongoing and future clinical trials in a timely manner, especially with respect to late breaking research presented at the annual meeting.</p>
<p>The proposed vendor is asked to provide a series of conference rooms between the hours of 3:00 PM and 9:00 PM, Thursday, June 2, 2016; and 6:00 AM - 9:00 PM Friday, June 3, 2016 through Monday, June 6, 2016. The vendor shall provide a complete audiovisual package, electrical package and communications package for each room.</p>
<p>CTEP is required to use the meeting space, Hilton Corporation Chicago assigned by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) organization. Ancillary Function Meeting Space requested during the ASCO 2016 Annual Meeting has to be requested and approved by the ASCO organization. Once the request is approved ASCP assigns the hotel meeting space.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested parties, especially small businesses, believe they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. A copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisition on or before 11:00 AM EST on May 22, 2016. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (240) 276-5401 or emailed to Kathy Elliott, Contract Specialist at Elliottk@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification on Sam.gov, www.sam.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number N02CM62571-61 all correspondence.</p>

<p><br />SEE ATTACHMENT A: IT SECURITY PROVISIONS AND ATTACHMENT B: 508 COMPLIANCE LANGUAGE STILL IN ACCORDANCE AND VALID SINCE EXISTING BASE CONTRACT.(Per the Information Systems Security Officer and Section 508 Coordinator)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A. Background:</span></p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative organized by the National Institute of Human Genome Research (NHGRI), the NIH Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) and the NIH Clinical center that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center with a mission that has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and diseases.</p>
<p>The goals of the UDP include finding accurate diagnoses and discovering new diseases that provide insight into human physiology and genetics. The UDP was established to evaluate participants who have undiagnosed medical conditions. UDP participants have generally received extensive diagnostic workups before traveling to the NIH and often have numerous and/or complex medical problems. The UDP program makes use of a diverse set of diagnostic and research techniques both to attempt to find a diagnosis and to generate research projects to advance medical knowledge. The unique tools and computing infrastructure is needed to improve, optimize and refine the UDP PhenoTips server that is currently deployed in the NIH UDP laboratory. These support the research needs of the UDP by providing a robust platform on which to perform the necessary phenotype analysis and record them into the PhenoTips server to be viewed by laboratory personnel and collaborators.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B. Purpose and Objectives</span>:</p>
<p>The purpose is to further develop the user interface for entering skeletal digital image data that is structured by patient anatomical features. The improvements will allow the NIH UDP to select relevant organ structures and map image data to appropriate HPO terms within the PhenoTips server that has been integrated into the UDP LIMS system that was designed to manage UDP patient samples, clinical and research data throughout the UDP program. The PhenoTips server is used by the clinical staff to input patient phenotype data into the LIMS system using standardized HPO terms. The further development will include a more effective interface that includes structured anatomical organs that can be mapped to appropriate HPO terms. The Contractor will also develop API's that will be used to connect UDPICs variants to the UDP PhenoTips instance, which will allow the system to be used with PhenomeCentral. Integral to these processes are constant updates to the UDP PhenoTips instances on the collaborator and internal sites in order to determine infrastructure that may be needed to improve, optimize and refine the UDP PhenoTips server, and LIMS system.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contractor's Requirement</span>:</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor will develop improvements to the skeletal imaging user interface: <br />o The Contractor will contain the ability to structure image data by anatomical organs<br />o The Contractor will contain the ability to rapidly select organ structure that have been mapped to HPO terms<br />o The Contractor will add novel relevant HPO terms at the discretion of the HPO development team<br />&bull; The Contractor will provide synchronization between the internal and external instances of PhenoTips, inclusive of the UDN network.<br />&bull; The Contractor will develope API's to transfer patient variant data from NHGRI UDPics into PhenoTips in order to allow for the system to be used by PheonmeCentral.<br />&bull; The Contractor will provide one-year of PhenoTips support:<br />o The Contractor will respond to emails within one business day to provide an preliminary estimate of turnaround time;<br />&#61607; Level 1: The Contractor's system unavailable or significant functionality failure will be fixed within 24 hours;<br />&#61607; Level 2: The Contractor's system unavailable or some functionality failure will be fixed within 48 hours; and<br />&#61607; Level 3: The Contractor's other system faults will be fixed within two weeks or on an agreed upon timeframe with the Government NHGRI-UDP.<br />o The Contractor will install new PhenoTips versions throughout the year as available.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C. Procurement:</span></p>
<p>1. PhenoTips&reg; Gold Support (12-Months);<br />2. Skeletal Imaging User Interface Improvements; and<br />3. Connecting UDPICS variants with UDPs PhenoTips&reg; Instance.</p>

<p>Description:</p>
<p>Within the Federal government, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is tasked with protecting the civilian population by providing leadership in research, development, acquisition, deployment, and use of effective medical countermeasures for the adverse health effects resulting from intentional exposure to CBRN threat agents, pandemics and emerging infectious disease threats.</p>
<p>HHS, through the interagency Public Health Emergency and Medical Countermeasure Enterprise (PHEMCE) is responsible for the integration of requirements for the advanced development and procurement of medical countermeasures for CBRN, pandemic influenza and emerging infectious disease threats. The 2014 HHS PHEMCE Strategy and Implementation Plan describes the strategic policy goals and objectives for identifying requirements and establishes the priorities for the development of the medical countermeasures against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats, pandemic influenza and emerging infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Under the Project BioShield (PBS) Act (2004) and the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (2006), BARDA was charged with developing medical countermeasures (MCMs) to address radiological and nuclear threats to the United States as determined by the Department of Homeland Security as Material Threats. In the aftermath of an improvised nuclear device (IND) detonation or a nuclear accident, having rapid and accurate measurements of internal radiation absorption in exposed persons can inform life-saving medical decisions. The high-throughput biodosimetry test is a dose-dependent measurement of the biological changes caused by ionizing radiation that result in internal body damage. The test results will determine the level, duration, and combination of medical care administered to an individual. BARDA anticipates that contracts awarded from this RFP will serve to facilitate the test validation, EUA and FDA diagnostic filings, and the initial stockpiling of biodosimetry tests for use in a nuclear incident.</p>
<p>HHS, through ASPR and BARDA, anticipates 1-2 contract award(s) will be made to radiation biodosimetry test developers. The anticipated period of performance for any resultant contracts may be for a total of up to 120 months which includes the base plus option periods. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Mandatory Criteria for Eligibility <br />Offerors must meet the following mandatory criterion and data must be provided in the proposal to demonstrate eligibility validity for a High-throughput Biodosimetry award:</p>
<p>&bull; Semi-quantitative or quantitative test with an accuracy of &plusmn; 1 Gy (&plusmn; 0.5 Gy preferred) across an absorbed-dose range of 2-6 Gy, measured from 24 hours to at least 7 days post-irradiation<br />&bull; Using an arrangement of no more than 150 instruments, commercially placed in clinical reference, hospital, or public healthcare laboratories, can potentially generate a daily result output capability of more than 60,000 test results over at least 7 days post-incident.<br />&bull; Assay has analytical performance demonstrating the comparability of results between in vivo irradiated human and non-human primate samples, to support entering into design validation per requirements in the U.S. FDA Quality Systems Regulations.</p>
<p>If a Request for Proposal were published, it might include some of the following programmatic objectives:<br />&bull; Advanced development and clinical validation of a high-throughput radiation biodosimetry test candidate <br />&bull; Development of comprehensive milestone-driven test and reagent manufacturing and procurement plans and their execution.<br />&bull; Provision of specialized specimen collection tube capabilities (if required for the test), <br />&bull; Establishment and maintenance of Quality, Risk, Security, and Earned Value Management Systems.<br />&bull; Development of a comprehensive milestone-driven instrument manufacturing or upgrade plan and activities to execute the plan after regulatory action has occurred. <br />&bull; Development of items for Sustainability of Preparedness<br />&bull; Provision of Project Management, Reporting, Meetings/Site Visit Capabilities<br />&bull; Establishment and maintenance of a national stockpile of high-throughput biodosimetry testing reagents<br />&bull; Activities to potentially upgrade the test for greater throughput, higher efficiency, or lower cost without posing new device or assay safety or effectiveness questions<br />&bull; Provision to execute Post-Marketing Commitments and/or Requirements<br />&bull; Establish and maintain inventory procurements</p>
<p><br />Pre-solicitation Notice Objective:</p>

<DESC>FAR 8 - JUSTIFICATION FOR LIMITING SOURCES <$150K

Acquisition Plan Action ID: VA262-16-AP-5677

1.	Description of Action:

Nature:      0  New Requirement   1  Follow-on Order 
                  0  Mod to Existing Order Number 	Insert task/delivery order no.  		

Order against:  0   FSS Contract Number: GS-35F-0505U

Name of Proposed Contractor:	Vector Resources, Inc.
Street Address:	3530 Voyager St.
City, State, Zip:	Torrance, CA 90503
Phone:	310-436-1052

2.	Description of Supplies or Services:

The estimated value of the proposed action is $34,999.94

The Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, equipment, materials supplies, parts to perform on site full maintenance service on Government Video Surveillance Equipment for VA Loma Linda Healthcare System. The current task order did not take into account that there are thirty-five (35) more cameras that need maintenance and repair which has increased the scope therefore a new task order is needed to facilitate the survellience system.

3.	Authority: 

ORDER AGAINST FSS:  Authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program, Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 USC 251, et seq.); Title 40 USC 501, Services for Executive Agencies; and Section 803 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2002 (PL 107-107) and implemented by FAR 8.405-6.  Mark the applicable exception:

0  An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays(FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A);

1  Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized; (FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B)) or

0  In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order and the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order was not previously issued under sole-source or limited-sources procedures. (FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C)

?
4.	Rational/explanation to support cited authority: 

Vector Resources is the  current Contractor that provides maintenance and repair of the video surveillance system. The current task order did not account for all the cameras that are located at VA Loma Linda, thereby doubling the scope.  These changes are critical for maintaining a fully functioning video surveillance system to provide oversight and surveillance in critical areas of the Healthcare System. Additionally, inoperable monitors at the nurses station in the Emergency Room leaves critical areas "blind" to observation leaving these areas vulnerable to security breaches and incidents.  The changes requested under this modification fall under the current scope of maintaining the Police Security and Surveillance System under the current contract held by Vector USA, who has intimate knowledge of the sensitive environment and specific knowledge of the systems installed.  Allowing a vendor unfamiliar with the current environment to provide these critical services would expose the VA to unnecessary risks and costs with needless ramp up time for the vendor to learn the environment.   

5.	BRAND NAME ONLY:  This buy is estimated to exceed $25,000 and this documentation will be posted along with the RFQ on e-Buy, as required by FAR 8.405-6(b)(3).

6.	Note that this determination satisfies the requirements of FAR 8.405-6.  The requirement to prepare a written justification IAW FAR 6.303 does not apply to Federal Supply Schedules.

This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in par. 3 below is sole source, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules, is precluded for the reasons indicated below.  

Restricted to the following source:  

Manufacturer/Contractor: Textura Corporation	
Manufacturer/Contractor POC & phone number:  Andrew Denney,  Phone: 678-300-7054	______

(1)  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:  Department of Veterans Affairs	
                                                                                 Minneapolis, NCO23__________
	                         VISN:   VISN 23	

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:

Service provided shall be a collaborative, online construction documentation management system to support VISN 23 Capital Asset Management, Planning, and Facilities Engineering.  

(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:

Services shall include an easy-to-use, online solution that will allow design and construction project participants to securely exchange, review, and archive project information in a centralized, cloud-accessible location.  The online solution shall provide document logging and tracking, version histories, schedules, and reminders.

Listed are the required service elements:

1.	Provide comprehensive, secure online system for electronically exchanging, reviewing, logging, and archiving construction submittals, Requests for Information, and other communications with all parties in the design and construction process.
2.	System shall provide for easy mark-ups of documents.  System shall include automatic flattening of PDF annotations so that there can be no unauthorized changes.
3.	System shall provide centralized system that will easily track project progress, allow efficient transfer of documents between the team, and provide automatic reminders of work in queue.  Documents may include daily logs, schedules, submittals, designs, specifications, LEED submittals, supplemental instructions, changes, photos, test reports, meeting minutes, etc.  System shall include an easy-to-read submittal log that tracks upload dates, reviews, etc.
4.	System shall provide transparency by allowing all team members to view and monitor project activities, access project information at any time, and provide for step-by-step version history. 
5.	Provide a simple platform to upload elements of work and required items from design and/or construction documents.  
6.	Provide complete and comprehensive assistance with work flow settings.
7.	System shall be capable of generating comprehensive reports for status and history of all documentation, reviews, approvals, etc.
8.    System shall have an easily searchable archive.  At the end of the project, all documents shall be archived on a CD or DVD, as directed by VHA project manager. 
9.	System shall have easily configurable administrative and security settings.  Security shall include secure data centers, protection with dedicated firewalls, 256-bit SSL encryption, and SHA-1 password-protected authentication.  System shall be backed up and ensure redundancy so that data cannot be lost.
10.	Service provider shall be responsible for complete maintenance of the system.

	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  Between $250,000 and $500,000	

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE:   9/28/16	

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  

X	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures.  The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures.

The original order was was posted to ebuy and was competed on GSA.    It was a Federal Supply buy, Contract # GS-35F-507BA, transaction order # VA263-15-F-0950.  The obligation was made on 9/28/15 and signed by Contracting Officer, Sharon Spohn.  There are already several projects underway on Textura's Submittal Exchange service.  It would be prudent to continue to use the existing subscription services so that these projects don't have to be pulled off of one contract and added to another.  It would create significant confusion and may result in design and/or construction delays that would cost VHA additional dollars.  Additionally, another important consideration when purchasing any kind of construction management system is the implementation plan.  Every user will need to be trained on the product, and often the adoption may be met with some kind of resistance from people who are comfortable doing things the old way.  Textura's Submittal Exchange has already been adopted at every station in the VISN and is used by Contracting Officers, CORs, Contractors, Subcontractors, and Architect-Engineering firms throughout VISN 23.  They have all gone through the training process and had accounts/passwords set up in Submittal Exchange.  It would be extremely challenging to roll-out a new, untested product when all the groundwork has already been completed for Textura's Submittal Exchange product.

CONTRACT ADMINISTRATOR: 
Andrew Denney 
Phone: 678-743-1449 
Fax: 515-457-2161 
Email: andrew.denney@texturacorp.com 
Contract Number: GS-35F-507BA 
Period Covered by Contract: September 10, 2014 through September 9, 2019	


(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  

Submittal Exchange has a competitive, scalable cost, based on construction project cost, so it's easy to use per project and not per office or per seat.  Submittal Exchange offers bundled pricing commercially for Greengrade and Submittal Exchange subscription services. This bundled option can be purchased by the Government at a 25% discount.

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
There are several similar programs available commercially; however, it's not clear which of these are available on the Federal Supply Schedule.  Textura Corporation offers Submittal Exchange as a Cloud Software by way of a Service (SaaS) arrangement.  Using this type of service, multiple users can access the software and application for Submittal Exchange from anywhere and reduce maintenance, infrastructure, and software upgrade costs.  The service is offered on the Federal Supply Schedule under 132-52 Electronic Commerce and Subscription Services.  Some of the similar projects commercially available (not available on FSS) are Newforma, Buzzsaw, and Procore Construction Software.

An RFI/Sources Sought notice was posted to GSA e-Buy on 4/4/2016 for 1 month (deadline to respond 5/2/2016) to seek out Contractors who could fulfill the procurement.  Of six companies on the GSA-FSS who reviewed the notice, four left no comment or response, one left a comment stating they could not fulfill the requirements, and one responded affirmatively that they can fulfill the requirement (the current Contractor, Textura Corporation).    

The Service Line spoke with Capital Asset Managers from other VISNs and Capital Support Engineers who had used Newforma in past.  They shared that Submittal Exchange would likely be a better fit for the type and size of projects that are managed at station level.

SubmittalExchange is easy to use, and fast.  Unlike most extranet programs tested and used, SubmittalExchange does not incur a significant administrative penalty cost in terms of time.  Their pricing model is also very well suited to our type of industry. 

 (7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:

Submittal Exchange is a collaborative online system that improves communications and processes related to exchanging, reviewing and archiving construction submittals, RFIs and other construction communications.  Submittal Exchange is available on AWS GovCloud (US) which offers increased security for construction project communication.  Submittal Exchange was also recently awarded the GSA IT Schedule 70, commonly referred to as "Schedule 70."  Schedule 70 is the largest, most widely-used acquisition vehicle in the federal government, providing access to products and services from more than 5,000 certified partners.  Textura is listed on the GSA Schedule under the contract number GS-35F-507BA. Submittal Exchange is provided under Special Item Number (SIN) 132-52.

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:  N/A.

(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.
