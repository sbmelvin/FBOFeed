<DESC>The purpose of this project will be to secure the services for hazardous fuels reduction and timber stand improvement on approximately 3579 acres of National Forest land on the Northern Hills Ranger District.  The objectives of the subsequest contract will be to reduce the potential of a wildfire reaching private homes adjacent to the National Forest and to provide strategic locations to help firefighters contain future wildfires.  This will be accomplished by reducing the total amount of surface fuel present and by breaking up the vertical and horizontal continuity of aerial fuels.  Also, stand characteristics will be improved by selectively thinning the understory to leave the largest, healthiest trees.

To achieve these objectives, this project will require mulching all ladder fuels, reducing the density of trees from seedlings two feet high up to trees with a 7 inch diameter at breast height (DBH), and mulching of all pre-existing and contractor created slash within the specified units. This will require contractor concern for stand visuals after treatment and the protection of private property during the treatment.  

The resultant contract will be awarded as a single firm-fixed priced, Performanced Based Service Contract, utilizing Request for Quote procedures.  

Numbered Note 1 Applies.

All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered for award.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT WANTS TO LEASE SPACE IN
SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS (SFO#4TX0209)

REQUIREMENT:
General Services Administration (GSA) is interested in leasing office space consisting of approximately            20,656 rentable square feet of either build-to-suit or existing space.  Rentable space must yield approximately 16,329 to 17,962 BOMA usable square feet of office and related space.  The space will be occupied by the Social Security Administration.

LEASE TERM: 15 years; 10 years firm term.

UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS:
New construction requires up to a 50-foot setback from any vehicular traffic including visitor or non-secured parking.  Office space must be contiguous and on one level without being split by a public corridor. First floor space is required. Space must have the potential for efficient layout; columns must be at least 28 ft. apart center to center and 28 feet from any interior wall and be no more than one foot square; space should not be U or L shaped or exceed a length to width ratio of 2:3.  The following space configurations will not be considered:  space with atriums or other areas interrupting contiguous space; extremely long or narrow runs of space; irregularly shaped space configurations or other unusual building features adversely affecting usage.  Space shall be located in a professional office setting and not within close proximity to residential areas, railroad tracks, busy intersections or one-way access roads.  Space shall not be located within a base flood plain or wetland unless the Government has determined it to be the only practicable alternative.  Space should not be located near establishments where alcoholic beverages are sold or served, or where there are tenants related to drug treatment or detention facilities.  For unimproved sites, the land should be of adequate size to accommodate separate employee and visitor parking and green space.  The Government requires a fully serviced lease including a total of 110 on-site parking spaces.  Normal hours of operation for the agency are Monday through Friday 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and federal holidays).

LOCATION:
Offered properties must be located in an area bounded by the streets shown below.  Offered properties which front the boundary line streets will be considered to be within the area of consideration.
	NORTH:   Southcross Boulevard
	EAST:      W.W. White Road
	SOUTH:   Loop 410
	WEST:     I-35 & Highway 16

Sites which are located directly on a highway or 6-lane thoroughfare shall not be considered in the following instances: (1) if the two directions of traffic are separated by a physical barrier or traffic indicator which does not permit access from either direction within a block; (2) if the location access is directly from a highway, unless there is a traffic control device within two blocks or equivalent from the proposed office space. Locations must be as convenient to the visiting public as possible.  Primary consideration in selecting boundaries will be accessibility by the public.

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:
1)	Building name and address.  For unimproved sites provide specific location.
2)	One-eighth inch scale drawing of space offered. For unimproved sites provide site plan and location map.
3)  Square footage offered. For unimproved sites provide total available acreage and proposed acreage.
4)  Method of measurement used to determine rentable square feet.
5)  Name, address, and telephone number of individual to be contacted
6)  Evidence of authority to represent the owner.

AUTHORIZED CONTACTS:
In no event shall the offer enter into negotiations or discussions concerning the space to be leased with representatives of any Federal Agency other than the officers and employees of General Services Administration (GSA) or their authorized representative.
