<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Program for the Economic Evaluation of Medical Technologies (PEEMT) within the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis to develop a strategic plan outlining steps for developing a framework and systems for integrating cost-effectiveness considerations within the current structure of the U.S. health care system, focusing on payment and coverage decisions for new technologies and pharmaceuticals.  The project represents the first phase of a two-phase research effort.  The successful and timely implementation of the second phase is entirely dependent on the timely and successful completion of the first Phase.  The tasks required for Phase I require researchers to have skills and experience in economic methods, policy analysis, and organization of group interactions and understanding of group dynamics, consensus building and precise writing.  The project also requires the knowledge of and interaction with all key stakeholders in this area of policy analysis and research.  The team at Harvard is uniquely qualified for this work.  They have the depth of expertise in cost-effectiveness methodology combined with knowledge and expertise in policy related to economic evaluation that is unmatched.  PEEMT is directed by a pioneer in the field of cost-effectiveness and health and medicine.  The deputy director, in addition to being a cost-effectiveness researcher, is arguably the leading writer on cost-effectiveness policy in the U.S. with a multitude of publications on this topic.  Harvard School of Public Health thus houses a prolific and highly respected research group in cost-effectiveness, which commands the respect and recognition that will encourage leaders in the field to participate in this project and has the requisite organizational, methodological, and substantive depth to assure the production of a high-quality report in a timely manner.

The strategic plan will address the following: 1) processes and methods for assuring quality and consistency of studies to increase their acceptability, including identification of areas of needed methodological improvements; 2) processes and methods for engaging stakeholders and for eliciting public input to address decision-making in the context of resource limits; and 3) specific options for decision making processes and methods using CEA and incorporating societal values in two specific areas: medical technology decisions and identifying research priorities.  As part of the strategic plan, the contractor will also propose 2-4 research projects which would assist in operationalizing the approaches presented in the strategic plan.  These projects may involve piloting proposed mechanisms, providing data to support the development of proposed processes, or otherwise directly contribute to progress or refinement of the plan, with priority given to processes and methods for engaging stakeholders.  

To provide baseline information for this effort, the contractor will produce a background paper detailing the social, political, ethical and methodological barriers to acceptance and increased use of cost effectiveness analyses (CEAs).   

The contractor will hold a 1-2 day conference to present the draft strategic plan and obtain feedback prior to finalization of the plan.  Conference attendees will be identified as part of the development of the strategic plan, representing organizations and decision makers critical to the evolution of health care decision making in the public and private sectors, with the goal of furthering the integration of cost-effectiveness considerations in policy decision making contexts.    
To develop the strategic plan, the contractor will convene an expert Panel, consisting of approximately 8-12 individuals familiar with cost-effectiveness analysis, resource allocation concerns, and public inputs to policy and including representatives of the private and public sectors involved with health care decision making.  The Panel will meet two times in the development of the strategic plan, and once following the conference to review the strategic plan.  The Contractor shall invite guest presenters as needed. Panel meetings shall be 1-2 days. The Contractor shall be responsible for facilitating the work of the Panel and for the management of meeting logistics, including such activities as selecting the meeting location, developing the meeting agenda, distributing meeting materials, making travel arrangements for Panel members, providing audio visual equipment, summarizing meeting results, and reimbursing Panel member travel costs from contract funds. 

The statutory authority is 10 USC 2304(C)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) – only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The tasks required for Phase I require researchers to have skills and experience in economic methods, policy analysis, and organization of group interactions and understanding of group dynamics, consensus building and precise writing.  The project also requires the knowledge of and interaction with all key stakeholders in this area of policy analysis and research.  The team at Harvard is uniquely qualified for this work.  They have the depth of expertise in cost-effectiveness methodology combined with knowledge and expertise in policy related to economic evaluation that is unmatched.  PEEMT is directed by a pioneer in the field of cost-effectiveness and health and medicine.  The deputy director, in addition to being a cost-effectiveness researcher, is arguably the leading writer on cost-effectiveness policy in the U.S. with a multitude of publications on this topic.  Harvard School of Public Health thus houses a prolific and highly respected research group in cost-effectiveness, which commands the respect and recognition that will encourage leaders in the field to participate in this project and has the requisite organizational, methodological, and substantive depth to assure the production of a high-quality report in a timely manner.  The Harvard team has the unique combination of skills, credibility and experience that qualify it to meet the objectives of this project and within the required timeframes.  No other organization is able to provide this expertise as specifically requested.  As a result, AHRQ has determined that award to any other source would likely require a significant reduction in the quality of the strategic plan, would result in higher start up costs and at least several months reduction in the time for development of the strategic plan.

The estimated issue date for the Request for Proposal is January 10, 2005.  This synopsis of intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties may submit capability statements.  In order to be determined to be capable, the contractor must have strong skills and experience in economic methods, policy analysis, and organization of group interactions and understanding of group dynamics, consensus building and precise writing.  The contractor should understand the history of the use of cost-effectiveness in various decision-making contexts, both in the U.S. and internationally, and in both the public and private sectors.  Thorough understanding of debates regarding CEA methodology are required, as is familiarity with the ethical and other social issues surrounding the use of CEA in policy and in resource allocation decisions generally.  The project will also require knowledge of and interactions with all key stakeholders in this area of policy analysis and research.   Responses to this notice shall be mailed to:  Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Division of Contracts Management, 540 Gaither Road, Rockville, MD  20850, Attention:  Sharon Williams or by fax at 301-427-1740.  Telephone and/or e-mail responses will not be accepted.  Capability statements must be received in writing, by no later than January 5, 2005.    Capability statements must include detailed information demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The National Science Foundation (NSF) intends to procure, on a sole-source basis, the High Tech Indicators (HTI) statistical series for 2005.  The HTI include four “Input” indicators predictive of future competitiveness of 33 nations and one “output” indicator that gauge current competitiveness.   Additionally, suitable indicators of national technological competitiveness, which are based solely on statistical data, will be benchmarked to the traditional HTI series that combines statistical and expert opinion measures.  This is a proprietary activity of a special nature.  The Georgia Technology Policy and Assessment Center (TPAC) is uniquely qualified to undertake this work because they have led the development of the High-Tech model since the early 1980s.    In addition, the HTI Model is only offered by TPAC, and they alone have access to the micro data supporting the earlier results.   There are no other known sources.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1).   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement of submit proposals.  The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  An ombudsman has been appointed to help resolve any offeror’s non-routine matters or concerns that may not have been sufficiently addressed by the Contracting Officer.  Additional information concerning the Ombudsman program, including contract information, may be found at http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dacs/ombud.htm. See numbered note 22.

<DESC>Note 22 applies.  The Government intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with High Tech Industries of Corona, CA for design,fabrication, and installation of custom consoles for a digital-server based radio broadcast system.  The consoles will provide expanded control capacities by combining various outboard functions to new centralized locations.  The custom design will allow similar viewing locations, workspace layout, and ergonomics of existing systems while incorporating new equipment consistent with the design of the digital-server radio broadcast system.  This requirement is time-sensitive because of the anticipated award of the digital radio project contract, and the need to make space for the digital radio section, which will change location from the shared space of the digital-server based television system presently in operation.  The digital television system uses consoles similar to the ones planned for this procurement, with design features that can be easily adapted for use by radio.  The television consoles were designed by High Tech Industries.

<DESC>The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerates the prototyping and deployment of technologies that
reduce homeland vulnerabilities. HSARPA performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses,
Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and universities. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) addresses a need that is becoming more serious as the nation’s emergency responder community prepares to combat the results of
future terrorist attacks – highly innovative/revolutionary protective materials and materials systems that can be used by emergency responders and Homeland Security Operations professionals in multi-hazard environments. Many of the requirements presented in Section 3 have been derived from Project Responder1. The R&D efforts, however, are not limited to the basic guidelines provided in Project Responder2. As we
continue to assess operations resulting from terrorist or other mass destruction/mass casualty incidents, other national level guidelines will apply. Cross referencing applicable requirement and concept of operations documentation is encouraged and will
be assessed as part of the proposal evaluation process. This is a dynamic environment with rapidly changing and emerging requirements. It is incumbent upon all participants
in this R&D process to ensure that the collective R&D initiatives are responsive to improving protection against traditional and emerging hazards, and are applicable to a
wide range of Emergency Responder (ER) and Homeland Security Operations (HLS Ops) professionals. Safety, time, and operational effectiveness are among the most precious commodities to ER / HLS Ops professionals. Currently, those professionals use a variety of protective garments and systems tailored specifically for their individual area of expertise and occupational environments. While this approach has been moderately successful to date, it does not address the new challenges encountered and will continue to be encountered in both the near and far term. These missions will continue to include conventional response in multi-hazard environments, as well as the aftermath of terrorist incidents. 
The research, development and maturation of materials or technologies that can be used in multi-hazard environments must be applicable to diverse users, as well as integrated
into more complex systems. Focus will be on materials that are lighter-weight or reduce the weight of the overall personal protective system, that are robust and able to withstand
the challenges of strenuous activity in unstable and uncertain conditions (rubble, collapsing structures, flying debris, etc.) and environments (extreme heat or cold, wind,
rain, flash fire), and provide protection against a multitude of hazards (industrial chemicals, chemical or biological warfare agents, radiation, shrapnel, flying debris, other). The ultimate goal of this effort is a single material solution that protects against all hazardous conditions. However, a significant breakthrough in material integration that results in a material solution that protects against numerous conditions will be
considered. This BAA is being supported by the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Systems Center, a Department of the Army organization. Programmatic inquiries relating to this BAA and
inquiries concerning white paper and proposal submissions will be handled by the HSARPA Program Manager. Other inquiries, including questions concerning requirements and contracting actions will be handled by either the HSARPA Program
Manager or the technical and contracting representatives at the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Systems Center (see Section 7.11 for contact information).

A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Apprentice Program has been in place since 1902, and in its present form with Olympic College since 1950.  Olympic College is the only community college located in Kitsap County and within close proximity of the PSNS that can adequately accommodate more than 542 appointees in the program.  Over time, they have developed classes, such as “College Level Principles of Technology” and “College Level Applied Mathematics,” that are proprietary to the program.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, (SPAWARSYSCEN) San Diego, in support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Director of Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E), is seeking proposals for the Information Systems Technology Test (ISTT) Focus Area for the Test and Evaluation / Science and Technology (T&E/S&T) Program. A two-step process is established for offerors contemplating submission of a proposal under this BAA. Proposals may be for projects or investigations that can be completed within a year of award, or for multiple year projects as long as each subsequent phase can be funded as individual options with clearly defined milestones and deliverables. DOT&E strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities that take into consideration previous and current relevant work, and significant and relevant engineering tradeoffs and optimizations. The ISTT focus area emphasizes the development of advanced test technologies to enable non-intrusive testing and evaluation of future warfighting information systems in complex network-centric environments.  The major components of information systems technology being addressed by the ISTT focus area are: · Communications Networks · Composable Data Sources and Network Interactions · Information Assurance · Decision Making o Applications o Collaboration o Human-Computer Interfaces. The ISTT program has a specific interest in, but is not limited to, the following technical areas: 1.  Interoperability of network devices in large, complex network architectures. Methods and instruments are needed to evaluate the end-to-end connectivity, interoperability, and capability of secure and non-secure systems-of-systems communications networks. Test technologies should assist in assessing the ability to provide services to and accept services from other systems, units, or forces; and to use those services to operate effectively together.  Network performance is affected by applications-generated traffic, which in most cases, can be measured and evaluated. These results are difficult to scale in large military networks when ten's or hundred's of participants are engaged in distributive, collaborative planning. Methods and tools are needed to effectively and realistically scale up and synthesize the participants of large military networks and evaluate the impact of their simultaneous multiplayer activities on the network. 2.  Composable data sources and network interactions. Warfighters operating in a Network-centric environment will be able to compose the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) elements at their disposal. This composable environment enables discovery and utilization of web-based services and sources of data as well as to plug-and-play new hardware and software. Composability will permit creation of new functional capabilities that meet emergent warfighting requirements. Communities of interest will be formed consisting of multiplayer simultaneous activities. The supporting networks will be seamless, secure, self-organizing, and self-healing. As these networks recompose, network scalability becomes an issue. Non-intrusive methods and tools are needed to evaluate the performance of composable networks including scalability, self-organization, and self-healing. 3.  Effectiveness of information assurance. Information Assurance (IA) protects computer networks, information, and information systems, ensuring availability, integrity, authentication, and confidentiality. Evaluation of IA products and systems requires techniques to generate realistic data that is representative of DoD networks. This includes operation under nominal conditions, crisis induced congestion, and the influence of realistic attacks.  Technologies are needed to assess the effectiveness of information assurance capabilities on large system-of-systems and composable networks. 4.  Decision-making systems, including the actions of intelligent agents. a.  Evaluations of systems in the decision making process. Such evaluations can rarely be performed with the granularity necessary to determine the value of individual components and the information that they contribute to the decision process. This is particularly true of automation intended to support higher-level decision-making that doesn't have a strong repetitive nature. The current state of the practice for evaluating decision support technology is to use techniques that originated in the behavioral sciences. This approach allows the human-computer team to be evaluated using a new technology and their performance compared to teams that do not use the technology under consideration. This is an expensive and tedious process and can rarely be used to evaluate all of the components of a complicated system. Methods to instrument and measure the individual contributions of a system are needed to allow more specific results to be obtained.    b.  Testing the functions of command and control and decision support systems including the actions of intelligent agents.   Thorough testing of command and control and decision support systems prior to release to Warfighters is a critical aspect of high-quality system design. The inability to accomplish this task may lead to the dangerous, and potentially fatal, condition of Warfighters relying on systems whose outputs may have a significant amount of uncertainty.  Thorough testing requires a great deal of effort and is a difficult job because tools necessary to facilitate such testing are not well developed.  This problem is compounded with the requirement to test intelligent agents, whose ability to "learn" makes it difficult to predict their future performance.  Technologies are needed to assess the effectiveness of command and control and decision support systems including the actions of intelligent agent capabilities in large system-of-systems networks.  Additional background information can be viewed at the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central (SPAWAR E-CC). The URL for this site is https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil (note that this does not include a "www" prefix) under the BAA number.  Proposed efforts should offer the potential for a significant impact on the current technology and have bearing on issues confronting our Defense and National Security. BAA INFORMATION This announcement will be open through 04 February 2005.  The Government reserves the right to award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions. Proposed efforts should be phased in 12-month segments with specific capability goals to be achieved at the end of each segment. Funding of approximately $1.0M total is expected, but not guaranteed, for awards in FY05. Multiple awards are possible and the funding level is anticipated to increase modestly in the out years. Offerors should be aware that there is no certainty in the funding level or level of effort. A two-step process is established for offerors contemplating submission of a proposal under this BAA.  The process will begin with the submission of a 6-page (single-sided) abstract.  Specific instructions relating to submission and content of the abstract can be viewed at the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central (SPAWAR E-CC). The URL for this site is https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil (note that this does not include a "www" prefix) under the BAA number.  These abstracts will be evaluated using a reduced set consisting of criteria 1 through 5 in descending order of importance, of the criteria listed below. Based on this evaluation, the Government will notify offerers as to possible interest in their proposals and request full proposals be submitted.  A debrief will not be available for abstracts submitted. Each proposal will then be evaluated using the full set of criteria listed below in descending order of importance: 1. Overall scientific or technical merit of the proposal, 2. Effort is an advanced science or technology development that satisfies a militarily relevant test and evaluation need, 3. Potential for technical success, 4. Potential for transition to a Department of Defense test capability, 5. Value of the project to the T&E/S&T program, 6. The offeror's capabilities, plan of execution, and facilities, 7. Realism of the proposed cost. All program participants will be expected to share technical information, subject to non-disclosure requirements, with all other T&E/S&T program participants. Offerors are advised that certain individuals from Scientific Research Corporation, CNS Technologies, Inc and Newtech may assist the Government as subject matter experts (SME) in performing evaluations of the abstracts and proposals submitted under this announcement.  These SMEs will be authorized to access portions of the proposal data and engage in discussions that are necessary to enable them to provide specific advice on specialized matters or on particular problems.  The SMEs will not rank offerors' proposals.  Any objection to disclose information to these SMEs should be provided in writing BEFORE the date set for receipt of proposals and shall include a detailed statement for the basis of the objection.  Any objection to disclosure could affect the results of the evaluation. Administrative questions for both abstracts and proposals may be addressed to Ms. Esther E. Christianson at (619) 553-4333 or e-mail at esther.christianson@navy.mil or mailed to SPAWARSYSCEN, Attn: Esther E. Christianson, Code 226, 53560 Hull St., San Diego, CA 92152-5001. Technical questions may be submitted, by email only, to Mr. Robert Kolesar, e-mail Robert.kolesar@navy.mil with a copy to Esther Christianson. The answer to the two most frequently asked questions, "Is this of interest?" or "Is this within scope of the BAA?" will be answered by, "An abstract must be submitted in order to answer your question." The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the abstracts/proposals received in response to this announcement. The Government may also only select specific tasks within a proposal for award. This notice constitutes a BAA as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2).

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 12 and Part 13 Commercial and Simplified procedures, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Horiba Instruments to procure a Horiba GDC-70 Gas Divider & NOx Checker.  This unit is necessary to perform linearization curves on the Horiba Mexa 7000 Series analytical benches that operate many of the Horiba equipment items that NVFEL uses. Based upon the need for data quality consistency and set-up capability EPA is pursuing this as a sole source.  The GDC-70 Gas Divider & NOx checker will offer consistent data quality on the Horiba analyzers currently in use at NVFEL.  A different Gas Divider with different operational characteristics and flow rates from those currently being used would impair the NVFEL's capacity for consistency in data.   The performance of different Horiba analyzers on the NVFEL equipment can only be compared to one another by keeping the testing apparatus and test procedure the same for every test. A Gas Divider other than the Horiba GDC-70 Gas Divider & NOx Checker would be a different testing apparatus and would make the data collected from the different analyzers non-comparable.  Further, a different Gas Divider model would mean extensive programming changes to the NVFEL data acquisition system and additional wiring of the Horiba interface.  EPA intends to include an option for two additional Horiba GDC-70 Gas Divider & NOx Checkers in this procurement.   THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond to the office identified above.  Documentation must be received by January 4, 2005 in order to be considered by the EPA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties should submit a written response to David Plagge by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail plagge.david@epa.gov to receive consideration for this contract. Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Research Center has a requirement for the production, test, and release of preclinical and clinical research Clinical Seed Stock (CSS) and a Master Viral Bank (MVB) of adenovirus-vectored malaria vaccines produced in a cell line sui table for human use.  The current Good Manufacturing Practices manufacturing of vaccine product will be based on existing Vector Seed Stocks generated by GenVEC, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland using their proprietary cell-line for the production of adenoviru s-vectored vaccines.  Manufacturing is set to begin in April 2005 to have CSS material available for pre-clinical safety and toxicology testing four months later, and to have MVB available for clinical testing four months following the safety and toxicolog y testing. The intent is to award a sole-source award to GenVec, Inc., as it is the sole proprietary holder of the GV11 vector compatible helper cell line required to produce recombinant adenovirus particles encoding malaria antigens suitable for use by th e Naval Medical Research Center Malaria Program.  The proposed contract is 100% set aside for a small business concern.  See note number 22.

SECTION L – INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS OR RESPONDENTS

SECTION L is Attachment 2

SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a)  This acquisition will utilize the Technically Acceptable-Performance/Price Tradeoff (TA-PPT) source selection procedure to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision.  The NAVAIDS need to be compatible in performance and data protocol with CLIN 0001 through 0007. A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror’s proposal will be made. Meeting the schedule requirements is one of main the determining factors for contact award. For those offerors who are determined to be technically acceptable, tradeoffs will be made between past performance and price.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the tradeoff process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the selection process.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as schedule, place of delivery, terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those included in paragraph (b)(1) below.

            
(b)   The TA-PPT evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:

     (1)  Technical.   Each offeror’s technical proposal will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach to meeting the government’s minimum requirements as described in the Schedule of Supplies.  Offeror’s proposals meeting the government’s minimum requirements will determined to be technically “acceptable”. The equipment needs to be standardized across the system for logistical, training, spare parts requirements and to enable it to be able to transmit data back to the ACC in Baghdad.  Installation of the NAVAIDs requires that these systems be compatible in performance and data protocol to the systems at Baghdad.
 
(2)  Performance.  For technically acceptable proposals, the past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offeror’s ability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past work record.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet users’ needs including cost and schedule.  The currency and relevancy of the information, the source of the information, context of the data and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered.  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.  The Government may consider an offeror’s contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.  However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort.  The following relevancy criteria apply:

•	VERY RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what this solicitation requires. 
•	RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. 
•	SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. 
•	NOT RELEVANT:  Did not involve any significant aspects of above.

In assessing present and past performance, the Government will employ several approaches, including, but not limited to:

(i).  Information utilized may be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, as well as from other sources known to the Government.  Data from previous source selections may be used if the data is recent and relevant.  Evaluation of present and past performance will include consideration of overall customer satisfaction and conclusions of informed judgment.  

	(ii).  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to  respond to the information.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  The confidence assessment will consider issues including, but not limited to, the number and severity of the problems, the appropriateness and/or effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised), and the offeror’s overall work record.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.

	(iii).  Past performance information will also be considered regarding any critical subcontractors and key personnel.  If an offeror, or the proposed key employees of the offeror, do not have a past performance history deemed relevant to this solicitation, the offeror will receive a neutral confidence rating.  The neutral confidence rating will be considered in the overall assessment for a best value decision.

	(iv) An overall confidence assessment rating will be made.  The following confidence assessment ratings apply:

Rating				Definition

Blue  			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
exceptional/high confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Green 		Based on the offerors record of performance there is very
good/significant confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Yellow		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
satisfactory/confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Grey			Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
neutral/unknown confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Black		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is
marginal/little confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Red			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
unsatisfactory/no confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

(3)  Price.  

 	    (a) IAW FAR Part 15.305 (a)(1) Cost or Price Evaluation, this competitive procurement will establish the basis for price reasonableness.
	
              (b) Total evaluated price, for award purposes, will be based upon the total price proposed
 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to negotiate on a Sole Source basis.  The U.S. Government has an urgent need to acquire and maintain within the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) a Pediatric Formulation of Potassium Iodide for children under the age of 10 years who live within a 20 mile radius of commercial nuclear power reactors that are included in the States with Potassium Iodide Distribution Programs. Iodine is an essential component of thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones are also essential to life having influence on development, growth, and metabolism. If radioactive iodine (radioiodine) enters the body, it will concentrate in the thyroid gland. Radioiodine exposure to the thyroid gland can lead to thyroid cancer or, if the radioactivity dose is large enough, destroy the thyroid gland. The population at highest risk for radioiodine exposure is children, due to the fact that children require thyroid hormone for normal growth and development. Following a nuclear detonation or reactor accident, several radioactive isotopes, including radioiodine, would be dispersed into the environment. One strategy developed to prevent incorporation of radioiodine into the thyroid gland is to saturate the thyroid gland with non-radioactive "stable" iodine so that if the thyroid is exposed to radioiodine, it will not take up radioiodine. The Government intends to enter into a sole source contract with the only currently known manufacturer of Potassium Iodide in a liquid formulation, Fleming and Company Pharmaceuticals of Fenton, Missouri. A commercial item award, resulting from a written RFP, with a base year and four option years is anticipated. The anticipated award date is on or about March 1, 2005. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement by submitting a capabilities statement to Terrie Nestor at the e-mail address below by January 3, 2005. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis DHHS-ORDC-05-01 may be submitted to Terrie Nestor at (301) 402-6790 or in writing to tnestor@niaid.nih.gov.

<DESC>Sections 8.1 and 8.2 of the BAA list general evaluation criteria for white papers and
proposals respectively. In addition to these general criteria, the following criteria will also
be considered. These criteria do not replace the criteria listed in the BAA but will be
taken into consideration as well. These criteria are listed in priority order:
• Is the technology truly revolutionary? Does it represent a major advance over
current technologies? Because of the revolutionary nature of the technology, will
the benefit provided to end users also be revolutionary?
• Is the technology applicable to the widest possible set of homeland security
uses/users? These will include emergency responders (including fire, police,
USAR, EMT), other public safety officers, Coast Guard personnel, and custom
officials and border guards but may be extended to other homeland security
uses/users.
• Is the development risk profile for the technology addressed both qualitatively
and quantitatively?
• Can the proposed program be executed within cost and schedule and with
acceptable risk?
• If a single technology (material/material system) does not address all
requirements, how will those requirements be addressed?

<DESC>AMENDMENT 1 to SolicitationW914NS-05-Q-0009:

Question 1:  CLIN 0005 appears to be a duplicate of CLIN 0003. Is it a duplicate CLIN, or is the requirement to provide a qty of 2 DVORs. Answer: CLIN 0003 is a duplicate of CLIN 0005, delete CLIN 0003. There is only one (1) D-VOR/DME.
CLIN 0007 makes reference to connecting the radios to a consolidated terminal. Please provide further clarification as to the 'consolidated terminal.”ANSWER: Consolidated Terminal should be in a console within the ATC Tower. 

Question 2:  In the paragraph immediately following CLIN 0017, the solicitation notice states:
'Provide a proposal with a construction cost estimate for the Basra Airport in accordance with the Statement of work that is attachment 1.  The proposal shall include pricing for a complete system at Basra Airport. The cost proposal shall be in individual line item format.  Costs for all options should be included'. We interpret this to mean that the offeror is to provide a cost estimate for the civil works, which involves siting of the ATC equipment and installation of the items delivered under CLINS 0001-0009, 0011 and 0014 above. We also interpret this to be a request for a cost estimate separate to the pricing requested for CLINs 0001 through 0017, and that is should be a cost estimate as opposed to FFP. Please confirm that this is a correct interpretation. Also, which requirements should be considered as options? ANSWER:  This is not a CLIN but is a statement to indicate that the proposal shall be to supply a complete system. If Offeror has no options, then last line does not apply.  All pricing should be for a firm fixed price contract. 

Question 3: You have requested pricing for commercial products sold internationally, however the SOW requires deliverables above and beyond those that are normally provided commercially, such as drawings converted to metric measurements and produced in Arabic. Can documentation be provided in the English language only? Answer: Drawings in English with metric measurements are acceptable. The solicitation includes 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders/Commercial Items.  This clause invites the CO to incorporate certain clauses by reference, however no clauses are checked. Is it your intent to identify those clauses that are to be incorporated by reference? ANSWER: Yes, they will incorporated by reference in the contract.
Is clause 52.232-30, Installment Payments, likely to be applicable?  ANSWER: Installment or Advanced payments will not be authorized however, the Government will entertain Progress Payments.

Question 4:  CLIN 0014 refers to an “Air Traffic Control tower and/or Approach Control facility”.  CLIN 0007 refers to “limited Approach Control Support”.  There is no other reference to an Approach Control in the other documents.  Since the automation equipment requested in CLIN 0002 does not adequately support a full approach control functionality could you provide additional clarification as to the intent?  ANSWER:  CLIN 0014 Delete “and/or Approach Control Facility.” CLIN 0007 Change “ “limited Approach Control support” to read “limited Approach support”. Approach Radar at Basra is to function as a “stand alone” facility, but it should have the capability to expand-be linked to the Approach Control Facility at Baghdad as part of a nationwide system.

Question 5:  Reference CLIN 0007: Ground to air radio Communication Systems: "Approach Control (APP) be linked to a consolidated Terminal Approach Control (TRACON) located at Baghdad International Airport". Does this mean that just the radio channels (frequencies 121.5 and 243.0 MHz) are to be remoted back to the Baghdad ACC  (TRACON) via the existing VSAT network?  Is there a requirement to remote any of the other 9 radios back to the Baghdad TRACON? Is it valid to assume that a Voice Communications Control Switch (VCCS) is required to assign the radio frequencies to the various controller positions: i.e. Local control, ground control, clearance delivery, and approach control? ANSWER:  CLIN 0007 Frequencies 121.5, 243.0 and one additional VHF (to provide Baghdad Radar Approach Control) are remoted back to Baghdad.  Provide a Voice Communications Control Switch (VCCS) for the following controller positions
Local control, Ground Control, Clearance delivery and Approach control.

Overview:  
 
The 50th Contracting Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base (SAFB), Colorado, seeks potential sources to provide high fidelity products, computer simulations, and information including detailed GPS performance assessments tailored specifically for the use of DoD and theater warfighting forces in support of the 2nd Space Operations Squadron (2 SOPS), Global Positioning System Operations Center (GPSOC) under Air Force Space Command, 50th Space Wing.  
 
These products are intended as decision-making tools in the operational planning and execution process.  The GSC shall provide monitoring of the performance of the GPS constellation and its constituent subsystems.  The GSC shall respond to DoD, United States Coast Guard (USCG) Navigation Center (NAVCEN), and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Operations Control Center (NOCC) problem reports and requests for information, and coordinate the collection, analysis, and distribution of information related to all GPS related anomalies on behalf of the 50 SW.  
 
Description of Action:  

The 50th Space Wing (50 SW) intends to acquire on-site technical GPS satellite communications support services for the GPS Operations Center (GPSOC).  The GPSOC concept brings together in one organization all of the expertise, data fusion and visualization capabilities, security clearances, and performance information required to maintain, operate and employ GPS to produce any desired effect across the full spectrum of conflict.  Specifically, this concept will bring together, under one umbrella, all of the disparate segments of the GPS operations, analysis and Navigation Warfare environments to form a single effects based center capable of optimally supporting Joint Vision 2020’s goal of full spectrum dominance and in full compliance with all national and international civil requirements.  The heart of the Center's effectiveness lies within its diverse personnel -- the GPSOC will be manned by representatives from across the DoD, DOT and allied military forces to create a unique operations center unlike any that currently exists at this echelon of command within the DoD.  
 
The overarching mission of the GPS Operations Center will be to operate, employ and maintain the Global Positioning System to produce a desired effect in support of military and/or civil operations across the full spectrum of conflict.  The key aspects of this effects-based GPSOC concept are:  
 
· Optimized constellation operations fully synchronized and supportive of SPACEAF and Combatant Commander's needs and operational priorities.  
· Robust, real-time performance monitoring and reporting ensuring a common operating picture and full situational awareness across all echelons of command.    
· Full integration, coordination and deconfliction of NAVWAR operations with routine military and civil operations for maximized impact and minimal collateral effects.  
· Direct and immediate access to an entire range of time critical GPS products and services designed to leverage the effectiveness of operations reliant on GPS services.  
· Rapid identification, isolation, and resolution of user reported outages or interference.  

The GPS Operations Center is key to delivering world class GPS user support.  It serves as the focal point for GPS interference reporting and resolution and as the joint center of GPS expertise for warfighting support.  The GPSOC has three main objectives: (1) detect, analyze, report, and resolve GPS anomalies, (2) monitor and report GPS performance, and (3) provide GPS status, constellation status, and tactical support.  The GPS Support Center (GSC) will provide high fidelity products, computer simulations, and information including detailed GPS performance assessments tailored specifically for the use of DoD and theater warfighting forces.  These products are intended as decision-making tools in the operational planning and execution process.  The GPSOC will provide monitoring of the performance of the GPS constellation and its constituent subsystems.  It will respond to DoD, United States Coast Guard (USCG) Navigation Center (NAVCEN), and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Operations Control Center (NOCC) problem reports and requests for information, and coordinate the collection, analysis, and distribution of information related to all GPS related anomalies through the 50 SW command structure.  

Areas of Qualifications/Capabilities:  

Respondents must demonstrate a thorough understanding of the GPS system and the 2 SOPS mission.  The support requires an in-depth knowledge of the GPS CONOPS, and the various types of data transmitted by each spacecraft to support various categories of users and missions. Core personnel must have an extensive background in the tools used by the GPS system to ensure the continuous availability and accuracy of the Position, Velocity and Time (PVT) information which is broadcast to all users of GPS.  This understanding is necessary for reporting GPS system performance predictions and analysis to a wide range of customers consisting of US armed forces, coalition and allied forces as required, Dept of Homeland Security through the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Navigation Center (NAVCEN), Dept of Transportation through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Operations Command Center (NOCC), foreign equivalents, and other organizations or agencies as required.  The support requires an in-depth knowledge of Precise Positioning Service (PPS) monitoring and analysis to include positioning accuracy, range domain accuracy, service availability, and time transfer accuracy.  

Respondents must have the ability to translate raw performance data, and process the data, to support the creation of several vital types of products for use within the GPSOC and other Ops Centers, and for customers worldwide via the GPSOC GPS Information Service.  Specifically, the data is used to create real-time situational awareness products and performance assessment products to ensure that the system is performing optimally and that all military and civil requirements are being met.  

Significant portions of the sub-tasks contained within this mission area are of a non-routine nature and demand a high level of system knowledge and expertise.  Anomalies within the ground based orbit determination system, the remote monitor stations, or on-board the spacecraft's navigation payload must be immediately detected, isolated, and resolved to protect the accuracy and integrity of the service provided to users.  

In order to provide global and regional performance predictions a high degree of expertise in using the following tools: Dilution of Precision (DOP), Estimated Range Deviation (ERD), Navigation Solution (NAVSOL) is required.  Respondents are required to analyze, report and coordinate all user reported GPS anomalies and interferences for anomaly resolution.  They will also provide post-mission GPS performance assessments tailored to the users specifically identified geographic region(s) or coordinates.  Continuous 24/7 support is required from the GPSOC Contractor to ensure the capability to respond to significant anomalies or failures that may emerge requiring GPSOC resources to solve in a timely or urgent manner.  

Incumbent Contractor:  
 
Overlook Corporation, currently performs GPS Support Center services under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) Contract #DASW01-01-D-0005.  

Performance Information:

This notice is not to be construed as a solicitation document.  The Government shall not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages for any technical information identified (e.g., limited and/or restricted rights).   This Special Notice is issued by Marine Corps Logistics Command at Albany, GA on behalf of the Joint Program Management Office for Individual Protection (JPMO-IP).  It serves as public notice regarding the status of the Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) Additional Source Qualification (JASQ) program.  The JASQ program is evaluating the performance characteristics of candidate materials and includes both a Qualified Products List (QPL) effort and a Unique Candidate effort.  The intent of both efforts remains the qualification of products for possible use in the JSLIST program.  The JASQ QPL began with the release of an RFI in December 2003 and is entering Phase III Testing.  The JASQ Unique Candidate is a concurrent initiative to identify emerging technologies to satisfy unmet JSLIST requirements.  The Unique Candidate effort is being conducted in four phases, as described below.  A.  Phase I – RFI  1) Release of original RFI announcement (Dec 2003) 2) Manufacturer submission of 8 yards (36” width) of material for Phase II screening tests B.  Phase II - Screening Tests will consist of but are not limited to the following: 1) Flame Resistance testing will be conducted on new material (unlaundered and laundered 4 times); the target performance value (TPV) are 10 seconds after flame; 30 seconds after glow; 4 inch burn distance; and no melt drip.  2) GD Seawater Immersion swatch test Liquid Challenge/Vapor Penetration (L/V); test results will be compared to TPV standards.   3) HD wet POL (JP8) swatch test (L/V); test results will be compared to TPV standards.  4) HD wet Body waste (Urine) swatch test (L/V); test results will be compared to TPV standards.   5) Weight of new material will be measured to ensure material candidate is equal to or less than 18.2-oz/yd2.   6) Notification of Phase II test results C.  Phase III - Full Regime Testing will consist of but is not limited to the following: 1) Manufacturer submittal of 180 suits made of the successful Phase II material for full regime testing 2) 30-day field durability trial with U.S Military personnel that will include field replicable hygienic cleanings. 3) Chemical agent swatch test (L/V) on worn candidate suits (HD, GD, GD Wet Sweat, and VX); test results will be compared to TPV standards.  4) Chemical agent swatch tests (L/V) on the unworn candidate suits (HD Seawater Immersion, HD wet AFFF, HD wet DEET, HD wet DF 200); test results will be compared to TPV standards. 5) Man In Simulant Tests (MIST) on unworn and worn candidate suits; test results will be compared to TPV standards. 6) Aerosol System Test on unworn and worn candidate suits; test results will be compared to TPV standards. 7) Swatch test Liquid Challenge/Liquid Penetration (L/L) on unworn and worn candidate suits (HD mandril, HD and GD expulsion, rain cabinet); test results will be compared to TPV standards. 8) Heat stress tests will be conducted on unworn new candidate suit using;  a)  Thermal manikin, the candidate must have a heat stress ratio greater than 0.21 Im /clo when tested at a wind speed of 2.5 mph,  b) Guarded hot plate, the candidate must have a water vapor resistance no greater than 9.6 m²PaW.  9) Flame Resistance will be conducted on new material (laundered 4x and unlaundered); test results will be compared to TPV standards of 10 seconds after flame; 30 seconds after glow; 4 inch burn distance; and no melt drip.

<SUBJECT>62 -- Update - FPI Production of Lightbars
<DESC>On July 24, 2004, Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) published a “good faith” notice in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) regarding vehicular lighting under Federal Supply Classification (FSC) Code 6220, Electric Vehicular Lights and Fixtures.  FPI last recorded sales in this FSC code in FY 2000 with the production of components for Remote Area Lighting System (RALS) at Lompoc.  The notice explained that it was FPI’s belief that light bars, classified under FSC code 6220, are similar to the components for RALS which FPI produced at Lompoc, also classified under FSC code 6220.  For this reason, FPI believes that light bars in FSC 6220 do not meet the definition of a "new product" as set forth by FPI's expansion guidelines. However, based on further research and analysis regarding the feasibility of FPI’s entry into this market, FPI will not pursue the production of lightbars at this time. Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI’s Board of Directors.  Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation, and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.  Attention: RACS Branch.

<SUBJECT>59 -- Update - FPI's FSC Code Change for AM Amplifiers
<DESC>On June 24, 2004, Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) posted a “good faith” notice in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) regarding the change in the Federal Supply Classification (FSC) Code of AM amplifiers.  The notice stated that FPI’s customer assigned a different classification code to the AM amplifier and it was transferred to FSC code 5996 - Amplifiers.  At that time, FPI did not provide products in this FSC code.  The AM amplifier that will be produced by FPI is the same as the item previously produced by FPI, with slight modifications to replace obsolete parts.  Therefore, it is not different in function from the previous amplifier classified in FSC code 5895.  For these reasons, FPI believes the AM amplifier classified in FSC 5996, does not meet the definition of a “new product” set forth by FPI’s expansion guidelines. 

FPI received no comments from interested parties regarding this proposed production within the 21 days allowed as stated in the June 24, 2004 FedBizOpps notice.  Therefore, AM amplifiers will be classified in FSC code 5996 and not be considered a “new product” for FPI. Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI’s Board of Directors.  Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation, and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.

<SUBJECT>25 -- Update - FPI Production in FSC Code 2590
<DESC>On July 24, 2004, Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) published a “good faith” announcement in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) regarding FPI’s intent to manufacture High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HUMMWV) spare tire carriers.  The notice explained that under FPI’s guidelines covering the production of new products and significant expansion of existing products, the primary determinant of what constitutes a “specific product” is an item’s Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code.  The HUMMWV spare tire carrier is classified in FSC code 2590 Miscellaneous Vehicular Components.  FPI has recorded sales in this category every year since FY 1997.
	
	Under FPI’s guidelines, the secondary determinant of what constitutes a “specific product” is an item’s Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code or the current North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code.  The most appropriate SIC and NAICS codes for HUMMWV spare tire carriers are:  SIC 3714, Motor Vehicle Parts and Accessories, and NAICS code 336399, All Other Motor Vehicle Parts Manufacturing.  FPI does not provide items in SIC 3714, but does make items in NAICS code 336399.
 
	The notice also stated that FPI has a history of making items in both the FSC code and NAICS code for HUMMWV spare tire carriers.  For this reason, FPI believes HUMMWV spare tire carriers do not meet the definition of "new product" set forth by FPI's guidelines.  FPI received no comments from interested parties regarding this proposed production within the 21 days allowed as stated in the July 24, 2004 FedBizOpps notice.  Therefore, HUMMVW spare tire carriers will not be considered a “new product” for FPI.

<SUBJECT>--Invitation to One-On-One Discussions for the US-UK Countermine Project Arrangement
<DESC>The Ministry of Defence of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (MoD) and the Department of Defense of the United States of America (DoD) have entered into a joint program of research into a vehicle-based system for the detection and countering of land mines on military routes.  The end objective of the program is to jointly develop and then evaluate a demonstration system.  The work will involve both MoD and DoD organizations, plus industrial organizations in both the UK and US, i n a fully collaborative program that will pool and share all information produced.  All work will be exploitable by either nation for future countermine and related work.  The program will focus on countering buried and surface laid anti-vehicle land mines  under the following conditions (in priority order): a.  Real time medium range (5m to 50m) mine detection and recognition from a ground vehicle; b.  Real time short-range (less than 5m) mine detection, recognition, and identification from a ground vehicle ; c.  Countering the threat at short range (less than 5m) from a ground vehicle.  The technical demonstrator system must provide a rate of advance broadly compatible with the tempo of military operations and be compatible with a medium weight force.  The t echnical demonstrator system must also offer the potential for enhancement to provide capability against a wider range of threats, more rapid rates of advance and other terrain.  The key to success for the program is early and continued industry participat ion.  To this end, UK and US sponsors provided program briefings to industry on the 28th October and 9th November 2004 in the US and UK respectively.  These briefings outlined the requirements for the program and also presented the UK and US background res earch in this field.  The presentation material can be found on http://conference.brtrc.com/ukus.  The aim of this announcement is to solicit expressions of interest from both UK and US industries in participating in joint collaboration during future phase s of the program.  As discussed at the industry briefing, the next phase of the collaborative program (Phase 2) will include a number of trade-off studies to identify the optimum system components for Phase 3.  An invitation to tender (ITT) for the trade-o ff studies, Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W909MY-05-R-0005, will be available from on or about 21 January 2005 from the US Army Single Face to Industry website at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.  It should be noted that at the end of Phase 2, the UK and US sponsors intend to award a competitive contract for the final phase (Phase 3) that encompasses the systems integration of a technical demonstrator.  In order to help industry understand what will be required in the trade-off studies phase, the UK and US  sponsors will host One-on-One discussions with interested companies and consortia/partnerships.  These discussions will provide interested parties with an opportunity to ask questions regarding the BAA and for parties to discuss their initial thoughts on their technical approach and considerations for trade-off studies.  In addition, interested parties are asked to discuss their experience as a system integrator and their approach to equitably addressing export licensing, Intellectual Property Rights, and security issues.  Ideally interested parties should have joint UK/US partnerships or intentions to partner, and have a strong systems integration capability. While involvement in the One-on-One process is not a requirement to participation in the BAA, part icipation is encouraged.  The one-on-one discussions in the US will take place during 28 February 2005  4 March 2005 in the Washington, DC metropolitan area and in the UK will take place during 7-11 March 2005 at Dstl, Fort Halstead, Kent.  Interested par ties should send an email to the Contracting Officer and provide the following information: name of company, address, point of contact, phone number, fax number , name of attendees.  Each One-on-One session will be limited to 2 hours and two daily time appointments (1000-1200 and 1400-1600) are available on a first-come basis.  Advance written questions or comments, while not required, may be submitted to the Cont racting Officer at peggy.melanson@cacw.army.mil.  Interested parties should email saphillips@dstl.gov.uk (UK) or peggy.melanson@cacw.army.mil (US) to schedule appointments for One-on-One discussions with the sponsors.

SCOPE OF WORK
Advisor in Governance, Anticorruption, Parliamentary Process and Human Rights
U.S. Personal Services Contract (GS-14) for USAID

Background
The USAID Europe and Eurasia Bureau (E&E) is involved in a comprehensive program of assistance to the states of the former Soviet Union and to Central and Eastern Europe.  E&E’s strategy focuses on three core areas: economic restructuring and growth, democracy and governance and the social dimensions of transition.  In addition, USAID develops cross-sector approaches to address critical obstacles and changing circumstances in the region.  During 2003–2004, these include: raising the profile of values inherent in transition programs; systematically addressing conflict and corruption in program analysis and design; and further developing social sector initiatives to broaden the benefits of reform and thereby sustain public support for it.

Three essential elements of E&E’s assistance to the region include helping to establish full democracies rooted in the rule of law, nurturing vibrant market economies, and supporting the emergence of a responsive social net to meet the needs of the people, especially those disadvantaged during difficult times of transition.

Within E&E, the Office of Democracy, Governance and Social Transition (E&E/DGST) provides the Bureau and the USAID field missions in the region with technical and strategic expertise on policy and strategies; program design, development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation; and program management for democracy and governance and social transitions, especially marginalized populations, health, labor and social safety nets.  The Office has three teams; Social Transition, Health and Democracy.  The teams serve as the Bureau’s key technical liaison in their respective fields with other USAID Bureaus and Offices, U.S. government agencies (particularly the Department of State, Department of Justice, and Department of Labor), international donors and external stakeholders.

Position Overview
The incumbent is a member of E&E/DGST’s Democracy Team.  As part of the Democracy Team, he/she has primary responsibility for providing technical advice to the E&E Bureau, State Department, USAID field offices in the E&E region, and other units of USAID in all areas related to governance and parliamentary process, including anticorruption efforts aimed at the executive or parliamentary level of government.
The advisor is responsible for developing and/or managing regional projects to assist in development of good governance models and regional cooperation among states in pursuit of government reforms and, where relevant, issues pertaining to accession to the European Union or other international bodies.

He/she collaborates with the State Department’s Office of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor efforts in the areas of human rights to advise on human rights interventions, protections and advocacy.

The incumbent also assists USAID field offices in the region in responding to appropriate foreign government requests for consultation and technical assistance supporting good governance at any level of state government.

Duties and Responsibilities

The specific duties and responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

Geographic Area or Region-Wide Technical Resource:

1.	provide Bureau leadership in the analysis of governance/corruption, parliamentary rule, and human rights, concerning the development of appropriate strategies, plans and support agreements as may be required;
2.	formulate policy and programming guidance for strategic planning; and analyze, design, implement, direct and evaluate policy reform and assistance programs for E&E countries and region that focus on governance/corruption, parliamentary rule and human rights;
3.	represent Bureau interests to senior-level and other host-government officials and representatives of local private sector and NGO entities;
4.	monitor and analyze social, cultural and institutional issues, arrangements and structures affecting governance/corruption, parliamentary rule and human rights in E&E countries and region;
5.	serve as key advisor to USAID field offices and host countries on improving executive and legislative branch governance and support broader Bureau staff and program efforts in the areas of anti-corruption and human rights;
6.	monitor State and Congressional interest in governance/corruption, parliamentary rule and human rights and serve as Bureau liaison to State, Congress and other U.S. entities;
7.	provide Bureau with analyses of the effectiveness of major democratic policy reform and non-project assistance interventions (including USAID and other development assistance agencies) that would be used for policy and strategy directions and resource allocation decisions;
8.	formulate agenda of research and analytic needs, as necessary, leading to policy and programming guidance for application throughout the Bureau, and identify strategies for pursuing assistance through bilateral and central/regional projects;
9.	consult with appropriate internal and external organizations on "best-practices" regarding governance/corruption, parliamentary rule and human rights;
10.	coordinate Bureau activities with technical officers in the field working in governance/corruption, parliamentary rule and human rights and provide them with assistance, guidance, and literature;

Program Development Assistance and/or Management:

1.	plan, develop and implement program/project development activities that affect governance/corruption, parliamentary rule and human rights.  Activities could include assessing gaps in applied research; interacting with PVOs/NGOs, bilateral and multi-lateral donors, other U.S. government institutions, think tanks and Congressional staff; assessing capabilities and identifying various organizations to serve as change-agents; and ensuring appropriate program/project documentation is professionally executed;
2.	advise Office, Bureau and field office staff on a variety of development assistance program/project issues;
3.	provide programmatic backstopping and management on high visibility projects, consulting with professionals in various sectors;
4.	direct or participate in geographic and central Bureau review of proposed development assistance projects and programs, policy, and technical input;
5.	provide project development support on the design and implementation of Bureau portfolio, which includes a variety of sectoral projects;
6.	lead the design and development of new development assistance programs/projects, including initial reconnaissance of projects; preparation of scopes of work for feasibility studies; selection of study contractors; and review and approval of completed feasibility studies;
7.	prepare or oversee the preparation of project papers/scopes of work, project agreements, project authorizations, Congressional notifications and implementation letters;
8.	review or oversee the review of contractor selection and approval, including related documents such as invitations for bid, plans and specifications for professional services;
9.	initiate or coordinate evaluation of development assistance projects during or following project completion, to ascertain project and cost effectiveness, including implications for future financing;
10.	travel to the region, as necessary, to assist USAID field offices.

Supervision
While the incumbent works under the direction of the Democracy Team Leader and coordinates with the Senior Rule of Law Advisor on Anti-Corruption, he/she needs to demonstrate a high degree of autonomy and responsibility.
