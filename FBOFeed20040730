<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 04-33 Persistent Ocean Surveillance (POS); CLOSING DATE: July 29, 2005; FULL PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS:  12:00 Noon Arlington, VA local time, September 28, 2004;   POC: Khine Latt, DARPA/ATO; Email: POS@darpa.mil;  Web: http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/POS/index.htm

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the performance of research, development, design, and testing to support the DARPA Persistent Ocean Surveillance Program (POS).

The POS program will enable naval forces to conduct maritime operations in the presence of diesel submarine threats and surface craft capable of launching anti-access weapons.  To effect rapid kill of anti-access defenses requires the deployment of networked sensors (agents) that are persistent and pervasive throughout the littoral. This effort will demonstrate the feasibility of a floating field of smart, long-term, station-keeping sensors capable of observing the ocean environment at a known location over an extended period of time.  The program will exploit local environmental effects (wind, waves, solar energy, temperature differentials, etc.), and geo-location technologies to establish long-term, station keeping ocean environment sensors.  The anticipated products are:
o Station-keeping and energy harvesting technologies using local environmental effects capable of maintaining less than a 250m watch radius for 90% of the time and a 2,500 meter watch radius for 100% of the time over a four week period in currents as high as 2 knots; and
o Prototype (tactical sized) ocean sensing buoy with continuous RF communications.

DARPA is seeking concepts that will provide either an entirely new military capability or will enhance existing capability by orders of magnitude (based on demonstrable relevant metrics), rather than extensions to existing systems or minor improvements to present capability.

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal in accordance with the instruction provided in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) at any time up to the proposal due date.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn: BAA04-33) on or before 12:00 Noon Arlington, VA local time, September 28, 2004.  

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.  This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiations. 

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this project are, in order of importance: (a) Technical Approach; (b) Operational Utility; (c) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission; and (d) Cost Realism.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.

The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA and to make award without discussions. 

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA must read the associated PIP available at www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov which provides specific information about this BAA, including instructions on how to respond. In the event that there is a discrepancy between information posted here and on www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov, the www.fedbizopps.gov site takes precedence.

<RESPDATE>091304
<ARCHDATE>07302005
<CONTACT>Linda Stewart Purchasing Agent 7074684005     lstewart@ca.blm.gov;
<DESC>Contractor to furnish all labor, equipment, supplies and materials to pave the driveway approach to Cowboy Camp Trail Head.  The project is located at milepost 1.0 on Highway 16, one mile south of Highway 20 in Colusa County.  The job includes placing 4 inches of asphalt concrete over base rock placed by the Bureau of Land Management on an approach to conform to a commercial driveway approach as seen on Exhibit "A".  The job will be bid in two parts.  Part "A" is approximately 2375 square feet and the depth is 4 inches.  Part "B" is approximately 2000 square feet is 4 inches. Weather Limitations:  Place bituminous mixture only during dry weather and on dry surfaces.  Place courses only when the surface temperature of the underlying course is greater than 45 degrees F. Tack Coat: Shall be used prior to placing 2 inch overlay over existing asphalt.  The paint binder (Tack Coat) shall meet Caltrans specifications SS-1. Asphalt: Shall be acquired from a commercial source and shall meet the requirements of ? inch minus, type B from the State of California Department of Transportation Standard Specifications, Section 39 dated July 1999. General:  Construction equipment used shall be dependable and adequate for the purpose intended, properly maintained in satisfactory and safe operating condition at all times. Rolling Equipment:  Self propelled steel wheeled rollers.  The number, type and weight of rollers shall be sufficient to compact the mixture to the required density without detrimentally affecting the compacted material.  All rollers shall be suitable for rolling hot mix bituminous pavements and capable of being operated both forward and backward without turning on the mat, and without loosening the surface being rolled.  Equip rollers with suitable devices and apparatus to keep the rolling surfaces wet and prevent adherence of bituminous mixture. Hand Tampers:  Shall have a minimum weight of 25 pounds with a tamping face of not more than 200 square inches. Asphalt concrete shall meet the requirements of Caltrans ? inch minus, type B. Shall provide all flagging, cones and flagmen as required by Caltrans to close the south bound lane of traffic on Highway 16 during paving operation. Surface Preparation of Underlying Course:  Prior to the laying of the asphalt, clean underlying course of all foreign or objectionable matter with power blowers or power brooms, supplemented by hand brooms and other cleaning methods where necessary. Preparation of Bituminized or Concreted Surfaces: The surface shall be cleaned to remove deleterious matter.  The edges of existing pavement, which are to be adjacent to new pavement, shall be cleaned of loose material to permit adhesion of the bitumen. Tack Coat:  Furnish and apply a tack coat over existing asphalt surface. Placing of Bituminous Material:  The pavement shall consist of hot mineral aggregate uniformly mixed with hot bituminous material. Transportation of Bituminous Mixtures:  Transport bituminous material from the mixing plant to the paving site in trucks having tight, clean, smooth beds that have been coated with a minimum amount of concentrated solution of hydrated lime and water or other approved coating to prevent adhesion of the mixture to the truck bodies.  Petroleum products will not be permitted for coating truck bodies.  If air temperature is less than 60?F or if haul time is greater than 30 minutes, cover each load with canvas or other approved material of ample size to protect the mixture from the loss of heat.  Make deliveries so that the spreading and rolling of all the mixture prepared for one day's run can be completed during daylight, unless adequate approved artificial lighting is provided.  Deliver mixture to the area to be paved in such a manner that the temperature at the time of dumping into the spreader will be higher than that specified herein.  Reject any loads that are below minimum temperature, that have crusts of cold unworkable material, or that have been wet excessively by rain.  Hauling over freshly laid material is not permitted. General Requirements for Use of Bituminous Spreaders:  The range of temperatures of the mixtures at the time of spreading shall be in accordance with Caltrans section 39.  Adjust spreader and regulate speed so that the surface of the course is smooth and continuous without tears and pulling, and of such depth that, when compacted, the surface conforms with the cross section, grade, and contour indicated. Placing of Bituminous Material:  The pavement shall consist of hot mineral aggregate uniformly mixed with hot bituminous material.  Place the pavement in one or more layers, as indicated. Shoveling, Raking, and Tamping After Machine spreading:  A sufficient number of shovelers and rakers shall follow the spreading machine adding or removing hot mixture and raking the mixture as required to obtain a course that when completed will conform to all requirements specified herein.  Broadcasting or fanning of mixture over areas being compacted is not permitted.  When segregation occurs in the mixture during placing, suspend spreading operation until the cause is determined and corrected.  Correct any irregularities in alignment left by the spreader by trimming directly behind the machine.  Immediately after trimming, compact edges of the course by tamping laterally with a metal lute or by other approved methods.  Distortion of the course during tamping is not permitted. Hand spreading in Lieu of Machine spreading:  In areas where the use of machine spreading is impractical, spread mixture by hand.  The range of temperatures of the mixtures when dumped onto the area to be paved shall be in accordance with Caltrans section 39.  Bituminous concrete having temperatures less than minimum spreading temperature when dumped onto the area to be paved will be rejected.  Spread mixture with hot rakes in a uniformly loose layer of a thickness that, when compacted, will conform to the required grade, thickness, and smoothness. During hand spreading, place each shovelfull of mixture by turning the shovel over in a manner that will prevent segregation.  In no case shall the mixture be placed by throwing or broadcasting from a shovel.  Do not dump loads any faster than can be properly handled by the shovelers and rakers. Compaction of Mixture:  Affect compaction by rolling.  Begin rolling as soon as placement of the mixture will bear the rollers without undue displacement. Joints:  All joints shall present the same texture, density, and smoothness as other portions of the course.  Carefully make joints between old and new pavement or within new pavements in a manner as to ensure a thorough and continuous bond between old and new sections of the course.  Paint all vertical contact surfaces of previously constructed sections with a thin uniform coat of emulsion or other approved bituminous material just before the fresh mixture is placed. Transverse Joints:  The roller shall pass over the unprotected end of the freshly laid mixture only when the laying of the course is to be discontinued.  Except when an approved bulkhead is used, cut back the edge of the previously laid course to expose an even, vertical surface for the full thickness of the course.  When exposed, rake fresh mixture against joints, thoroughly tamp with hot tampers, smooth with hot smoothers, and roll. Smoothness:  Straightedge test the compacted surface of the leveling, binder and wearing course as the work progresses.  Apply straightedge parallel with and at right angles to the centerline after final rolling.  Unevenness of the leveling and binder course shall not vary more than plus or minus 1/4 inch in 10 feet; variations in the wearing course shall not vary more than plus or minus 1/8 inch in 10 feet.  Correct any portion of the pavement showing irregularities greater than that specified. Requirements:  The Contractor shall be responsible for cleanup of all waste, spilled, and excess material as a result of his work.  No site tour will be held.  This solicitation is 100 percent set aside for small business concerns.  SOLICITATIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE ON OR AROUND August 13, 2004, and will close September 13, 2004, 12 a.m. EST.  To obtain this solicitation go to website http://ideasec.nbc.gov/. You must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) website http://www.ccr.gov.

Continuing a centuries-old legacy of extraordinary public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA)Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation's most talented architects to design Federal buildings of outstanding quality and value, buildings that provide superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees as well as give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.  In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for a New U. S. Federal Building to be constructed in Tuscaloosa, Alabama in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  The building is approximately 12 046 gross square meters (gsm) 129,664 gross square feet (gsf) without parking, and approximately 13 941 gsm 150,064 gsf including 51 interior parking spaces.  The proposed federal building will provide space for multiple agencies including US District Court, US Bankruptcy Court, Social Security Administration, and several other executive agency offices. The proposed facility will be constructed in downtown Tuscaloosa, AL with the exact site still to be determined.  The Estimated Construction Cost range is approximately $30 million to $40 million.

The facility will be designed in metric units.  The scope of work will require at a minimum:  metric construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, value engineering services, life cycle costing, space planning, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and construction phase services (option to be exercised at a later date) for a facility that includes the construction of a new building and related systems, inside parking, site development, client program requirements, and sustainable features.

GSA will contract separately during the design phase for construction management (CM) and/or Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) services.  The CM/CMc will be involved in the design process to provide:  construction expertise, estimating and cost information, and functionality and constructability reviews.  The CMc may continue with construction by separately procuring subcontracts for construction.  There will be a formal partnering process throughout the design and construction phases to promote successful project development and execution through voluntary commitments to accomplish established agreed-upon project objectives by all involved parties to their mutual benefit.

                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair 
and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was 
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and 
time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is 
empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General 
Accounting Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast 
Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest 
with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their 
concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or 
Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast 
Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to 
the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the 
concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for 
Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend 
contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time 
requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a 
timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the 
Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and 
solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency 
protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the 
contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are 
unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may 
file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, 
the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be 
suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in 
writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best 
interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 
calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at 
FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of 
the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling 
of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within 
the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program 
should be forwarded to the address below:

OVERVIEW a.	The Marine For Life (M4L) program relies on Reserve Marines, our Hometown Links (HTL), serving in the local communities around our country, to help sponsor transitioning Marines as they return home.  To do so, HTLs build relationships with veteran Marines and Marine-friendly organizations that have a desire to help transitioning Marines.  These are our resources.  The HTL’s build their resource networks to address a variety of tangible concerns that Marines have as they prepare for a major lifestyle change: information on employment, housing, adult education, schools for their children, and other matters. b.	The HTL team currently consists of Reserve Marines serving on active duty.  Beginning 2nd quarter Fiscal Year (FY) 04, these Marines will begin reverting to a drilling status.  By the end of FY04, all HTLs will serve in a drilling status.  However, they will not drill in a conventional manner.  They will work a total of 16 hours per month, just as any other reservist, but they will work throughout the month doing M4L business for short periods on a frequent basis.  This paradigm retains a viable degree of HTL accessibility and greatly reduces operating costs, but requires very efficient processes and flexible administrative support.  c.	Building resource networks requires mobility.  At the same time, HTLs must be accessible to transitioning Marines.  M4L processes are being developed to support this paradigm.  Using cell phones, laptops, and Internet access from their homes, HTLs can accomplish most of their M4L business.  However, there remains a need for traditional administrative resources: a copier, an official mailbox, fax machine, express mail capability, etc.  Currently, HTLs rely on the support available at Reserve Training Centers (RTCs).  In most cases, reliance on an RTC undermines efficiency.  Given the M4L drilling paradigm, traveling to and from an RTC on a frequent basis becomes untenable.  Distance and congestion consume precious time.  Moreover, Internet access from an RTC requires a Navy/Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) seat, which has not been planned for by Marine Forces Reserve.  d.	There is no advantage to having an HTL work at a particular physical location.  Program efficiency and long-term sustainability require more readily accessible administrative resources.  Commercial services, located around the country, can better meet the geographical and functional requirements of M4L in a cost effective manner, and relieve the burden on the RTCs.     2.  REQUIREMENTS In support of the M4L program, commercial administrative service support is required to make this program effective. Commercial administrative services provided shall meet the following requirements: a.	A facility located in the geographical areas where a HTL is located (see attached listing of HTL locations and planned locations).  Due to programmed turnover of HTLs, the flexibility of selecting a different facility within the same geographic area is a requirement.  HTLs will inevitably turnover at unpredictable times.  This will require a cessation of services at one facility and the start of services at another.  There must be an easy process for interchanging services within the same geographic location. Additionally, in several large metropolitan areas more than one HTL will be covering the area, e.g. New York, Chicago. The attached list reflects this.  b.	U.S Postal Services mailing services.  The ability to mail items - letters, large envelopes and packages using the U.S Postal Services is required.  The mailouts will be primarily promotional literature (8 ½” x 11” documents) and pamphlets.  HTLs will also send out standard letters in envelopes, postcards and have the ability mail the M4L Kiosk (a tradeshow kiosk that is shipped in its own container) that weighs 85lbs.  HTLs will also need to capability to package and mail their laptop computer and cell phones.  Priority Mail, Express Mail, Certified Mail and metered mail and the ability to insure packages is required.   c.	Mailbox Services.  HTLs require a post/mail box where they can receive mail.  The facility should have secure 24 hour access to mail deliveries.  A mail forwarding service is also required in the case a HTL moves or ceases drilling.  In this case, the mail will need to be forward to a follow-on address (of the HTL) or the M4L Headquarters (address below) for up to six months, after written notification from the Contracting Officer. 	Marine For Life  	3280 Russell Road 	Quantico, VA 22134             d.	Fax services.  HTLs require the ability to send and receive faxes - both local, long distance and overseas service.  Received faxes should be placed in the HTL’s post/mail box. e.	Color printers and copiers.  HTLs will require copy and printing services - black and white, color and digital printing capability from floppy disks, compact disks, etc. f.	A consolidated monthly bill (from all locations) with an itemization of services provided from each location.  To best facilitate management, the M4L Headquarters staff requires one primary bill be sent to the M4L Hq for payment, with detailed bills from each facility included with this invoice.  Details on the bills are required to be itemized with a breakdown of expenses; box rental, copies printed, faxes sent, packages mailed, etc. g.	The M4L Program will be adding additional locations as required, not to exceed 120, and have these additional sites included in the consolidated bills. There are currently 85 manned HTL locations(approx).  In the next year, there are planned to be over 100.  As sites are added, they must be added to the consolidated bill in an efficient, timely manner. 	   3.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE  	Base Year: Date of Contract Award – 30 September 2004 Option Year One: 1 October 2004 – 30 September 2005 	Option Year Two: 1 October 2005 – 30 September 2006 	Option Year Three: 1 October 2006 – 30 September 2007 	Option Year Four: 1 October 2007 – 30 September 2008 4.

Quality assurance plan, past performance, and price are equally important to each other.  (c) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (d) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of clause) 52.216-1     TYPE OF CONTRACT (APR 1984) The Government contemplates award of a hybrid Firm-Fixed Price (FFP)/Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract resulting from this solicitation. FFP shall be established for Mailbox services only (CLIN 0001AB).

(c) Except for any limitations on quantities in the Order Limitations clause or in the Schedule, there is no limit on the number of orders that may be issued.  The Government may issue orders requiring delivery to multiple destinations or performance at multiple locations. (d) Any order issued during the effective period of this contract and not completed within that period shall be completed by the Contractor within the time specified in the order.

<DESC>Contract N00140-02-C-3437 was placed with the University of West Florida (UWF) for the development and delivery of an enhanced version 3 of the University’s Institute of Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC) Concept Mapping Tools (Cmap Tools) and the application of Cmap Tools to the Skills Object Knowledge Model for the Professional Mariner Mission Area Analysis ratings. The proposed acquisition is for modifications and enhancements necessary to make Concept Mapping (Cmap) Tools more usable within the Navy’s NMCI Information Technology architecture and infrastructure.  As a result of laboratory evaluation and user feedback recommendations during the development and application process, the Navy has identified the need for additional capabilities and enhancements to version 3 of the Cmap Tools kit.  These additional requirements include: 1) modification of the client program Cmap Tools so that all outgoing client-server communication of the program will be through a single communications port and 2) modification of the server program Cmap Server so that it will accept communications through a single port from the client program Cmap Tools.  This will allow the client to communicate through ports that are configured for access to the web servers and allow the software to function within restricted network domains where the client is not able to communicate through firewalls with servers outside the firewall. UWF, IHMC will be tasked to develop knowledge model applications in such a manner that they may be hosted through Navy E-Learning distributed system.  These services involve labor, materials, equipment, supplies and travel.  The Navy intends to acquire the additional capabilities and enhancements to Cmap Tools Version 3 on a sole source basis from UWF as a modification to Contract Number N00140-02-C-3437. Due to the additional requirements, the contract’s period of performance will be extended through December 2005.  Numbered Notes 22 and 26 apply.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Dahlgren, Virginia has an urgent requirement for 450 belt pouches for the Expeditionary Tactical Communication System.  The Expeditionary Tactical Communication System (ETCS) Pouch, part #SK79800, is designed to house the Iridium ETCS phone sleeve, battery and charger assembly, and contain the associated cabling.  UTILIZATION.  The pouch is intended to be man portable by affixing it to the webbing on USMC flak jackets and load bearing vests.  The straps on the back of the pouch are used to weave the pouch onto the flak jackets.  Alternately, the pouch may be affixed to gear for man portable use by affixing bungee cords through the eyelets/and or weave straps on the pouch.  The pouch is also designed for tactical vehicle use such as in HMMWV’s, LAV variants, and MTVR’s.  This is accomplished by inserting turn button fasteners provided on vehicle mounting plates through the eyelets on the pouch.  In the vehicles, the pouch i! s mounted to the vehicle with the phone display and keypad easily viewable in an upright position.  For man portable carry, the pouch can be carried “upside down” and flipped open on the hinge to the upright position in order to quickly view the display while remaining affixed to the flak jacket.  The two usage positions require that the pouch be designed with water resistant membranes top and bottom that allow water to drain from both ends.  A total of 6 drain holes, 3 each top and bottom, are installed inside the water resistant membranes to enable water proof operation upside down or right side up and allow drainage capability.  Full width pockets exit both sides for cable egress.  Cable routing is provided through slots between the battery/charger and phone pockets, and to the 2 side cable egress pockets. Squeeze release, sew-on plastic buckles are used to reliably fasten the display cover, lid, and pouch.  All hinged seams are to be fully opening.  The pouch lid, back, ! and display cover need to open fully.  Straps for jacket/vest webbing attachment, phone/battery partition and sides are to be internally reinforced stiff plastic sheeting.  Glare resistant flexible clear window is utilized for the touch keypad and display.  Foam padding is stitched internally inside the pouch, top and bottom, for shock absorption.  The pouch must be capable of withstanding continuous use in a desert environment, as typified by current USMC OIF (Operation Iraqi Freedom).  The load contained in the pouch is approximately 20 lbs.  The pouch needs to be extremely durable to last during man portable and vehicle mounted usage.  The pouch needs to be able to withstand shipping in loaded and unloaded conditions.  The materials need to be rugged, and able to resist sunlight and extreme heat up to 140º F.  The finish and color needs to be in keeping with a desert camo scheme; a current USMC pattern would be preferred.  A solid desert sand color is also acceptable.  Fl! at black hardware is acceptable.  The entire pouch, all surfaces, must be non-reflective.  There must be absolutely no shiny metallic finish parts.  All metal parts must be coated and permanently non-reflective.  Metallic parts should be corrosion resistant and treated to enable use in coastal areas.  Detail Government drawings are available upon request.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Populations Genetics (LPG), plans to procure BRCA1/BRCA2 GENE SEQUENCING services with Myriad Genetic Laboratories, Inc., 320 Wakara Way, Salt Lake City, Utah 84108.   The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test  program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  The Laboratory of Population Genetics (LPG), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), is involved in numerous studies aimed at elucidating the genetic epidemiology of breast and ovarian cancer.  These include collaborative studies with the Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB) of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) and a study of the genetic epidemiology of familial breast cancer in Jordan that the LPG is leading. The LPG has a need to obtain complete sequencing of the two major breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility genes known as BRCA1 and BRCA2 as part of these research projects. Additionally, the LPG has a need for molecular testing for the presence of large deletions in the BRCA genes, which have been recently recognized as important contributors to hereditary breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility. The samples are from individuals with breast cancer or ovarian cancer or their family members. The current acquisition represents work to be done for the Government by Myriad Genetics, under a Memorandum of Understanding initially executed between the Provider and the National Cancer Institute in November 1999 and extended thereafter. The purpose of this MOU is to facilitate performance of these complex assays in support of NCI-sponsored clinical cancer genetics research.  Myriad Genetic Laboratories, Inc. is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the above service. It is essential to the ongoing scientific integrity and validity of the research studies being supported to obtain future data in a manner which will permit reliable comparison with assay results already obtained. In order to insure comparability of subsequent assay results with those already performed, this procurement is proposed as a sole source acquisition.  Failure to do so could invalidate the cornerstone of these important research projects, i.e., the accurate, timely and reliable classification of study participants with regard to their BRCA1/2 germline mutation status. Myriad Genetics owns the patents on both the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes, and thus is the only commercial vendor available to perform the required work.   This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above supplies, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EST on August 9, 2004.   If you have questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@excange.nih.gov or by fax at (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Solicitation number NCI-40116-NG must be stated on all correspondence.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  

The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with deCode Genetics, Inc.,  Sturlugata 8 IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.  The anticipated award to deCode will provide information to NHLBI regarding the genetic susceptibility to the vascular disease, restenosis.    The information will be obtained from deCode?s proprietary genealogy database and will assist in the determination of molecular and cellular signaling pathways important in the pathogenesis of restenosis as well as an analysis of the gene expression of individuals who received a coronary artery stent.  NHLBI currently conducts a study entitled, CarioGene which is an analysis of the genomics, genotyping and proteomics of restenosis.  It is envisioned that a linkage analysis to this study would greatly enhance information relative to polymorphisms that may confer susceptibility to restenosis.  

A computerized genealogy database is essential to the linkage study approach.  This allows for the identification of genealogical relationships and pedigrees for a large number of individuals in a defined group of affected.  This approach also eliminates the need for asking participants for familial relationships to the affected individuals since this information is already contained in deCode?s database.  This database contains 716,000 records on Icelandic individuals.  This figure is representative of half the Icelanders that survived into adulthood since the origin of the settlement more than 1,100 years ago.  The database is stored as a relational database with a personal identifier for each individual, together with sex, date of birth and death, in addition to the identifiers of the parents.  The database also includes the majority of individuals born in Iceland within the last two centuries.  For this period approximately 95% for the parental connections are known.  The database has proven very accurate.  A study using mitochondrial DNA suggests the accuracy for maternal lineages exceeds 99.3%.  Based upon the genotypes of the 100,000+ individuals typed for the framework marker set, the rate of false paternity is less than 2%.  deCodes? database genealogy cannot be studied in any other population and adds enormous power to the linkage approach utilized under this acquisition. 

deCode is the largest genotyping facility in the world and is capable of generating 30 million genotypes per month, backed by the densest and most accurate map of genomic markers.  deCode has propriety access to the database along with informatics expertise that allows for integrating and analyzing genetic, disease and genealogical data from large population studies.  This population data will directly benefit patients in determining who will best respond to stent placement as well as the development of new targets of treatment. 

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 541990 and the Size Standard affiliated with this code is $6.0M.  As stated above, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement within 25 days after publication of this synopsis.  The products and services being purchased are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2.  It is anticipated that a two (02) year contract will be awarded for this requirement.  The total contracted dollar amount is anticipated to be $901,000.00.  This action is entered into under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253©(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306-302-1 which states ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements?.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based on any responses to this notice rests solely with the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement should reference solicitation number NHLBI-PS-2004-130 and shall be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6150B, Bethesda, Maryland  20814-7902, Attention:  Sharon Cummings.

NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from ANSYS, Inc. for the following reasons: (1)ANSYS is the only known source for CFX and the annual maintenance agreement.(2)One seat is currently in use at MSFC TD 52 and the second CFX seat is required to be compatible with the first.  Use of competitor products will not provide the same capability.(3)The CFX code has the unique capabilities and features required to analyze the variety of fluid dynamic flows associated with the Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM) systems being tested at MSFC and at other NASA facilities.(4)The CFX code has the capability of analyzing the thermodynamic complexity of the two-phase system in either a 1-G or 0-G environment.  This capability will greatly enhance the ground systems testing and analysis to encompass on-orbit systems.(5)The CFX code has been proven to meet MSFC’s analytical requirements and has produced results that correlated well with CFM zero-G test data.  The maintenance for CFX will provide software updates and program support.	 The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 20, 2004.

<DESC>This solicitation is for small business set aside only. NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the delivery of the Engine Health Management System (EHMS) and associated computer codes and modules, as well as development of specific engancements to existing MSFC rocket engine diagnostic codes. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase an Engine Health Management System EHMS) from Quality Monitoring & Control, Inc., pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Competition is impractical because: (a) Quality Monitoring & Control is the developer of the QMC Program Suite and associated sensor and hardware codes for fault diagnostics.  These specific codes are required to support the Engine Diagnostic Model (EDM) efforts and cannot be obtained from other computer codes.  (b) Quality Monitoring & Control has substantial experience in creating the specific diagnostics software and technologies to adapt our existing codes to work in the SSME Engineering Environment.  The government program office will maximize investment dollars by taking advantage of Quality Monitoring & Control existing development and expertise.  (c) Quality Monitoring & Control software is currently under license at NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) for use in physics and numeric modeling as well as in sensor and equipment fault detection with diagnostics.  (d) Quality Monitoring & Control has the ability to perform real-time dynamic simulations and incorporates a newly developed property package that includes Rocket Propellant-1 (RP-1), which will be used to support analysis of new rocket engines.  (e) Quality Monitoring & Control is currently performing Engine Diagnostic Model (EDM) work at MSFC under a purchase order.  It is anticipated that this follow-on Purchase Order will be awarded within the next 30 days. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).

<SUBJECT>B -- Djibouti:  Djibouti City Seawater Desalinization Plant Feasibility Study
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-0410014A
<RESPDATE>091404

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@ustda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Mr. Abdulkader Kamil, Director, Office National des Eaux de Djibouti, B.P. 1914, Djibouti,  Phone: (253) 35 31 07,  Fax: (253) 35 44 23  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the a primary desalinization plant for the capital of Djibouti, Djibouti City.

Developing a potable water resource is a national priority for Djibouti.  Since the early 1980s, the quality of drinking water has rapidly deteriorated; of 30 wells for drinking water in Djibouti City, many are now showing increased chemical content concentrations.  For example, the chloride content in many of the wells now exceeds levels that are believed to be safe for drinking water by the World Health Organization (WHO).  However, due to the lack of fresh water resources, these wells continue to be used.  

The Office National des Eaux de Djibouti (ONED) has examined several ways to meet its need for potable water for the population of Djibouti City.  Despite the high energy cost in the country, the unit cost of water derived through desalinization may be less than the unit cost of water piped from the Hanle area of Djibouti , for example, because the distance (190 km) and terrain over which the water must be transmitted.  As a result, ONED has requested USTDA assistance in evaluating the technical and economic merits of desalinization to meet the country’s current and future water demand. 

An outline of the Terms of Reference for the study is as follows:

Task 1.  Data Collection and Review
Task 2.  Water Supply and Demand Analysis
Task 3.  Source Water Identification and Characterization
Task 4.  Water Intake/Outfall and Influent Pumping Analysis
Task 5.  Desalination Technologies Evaluation
Task 6.  Desalination Plant Silting Analysis
Task 7.  Treated Water Distribution Analysis  
Task 8.  Conceptual Design Development
Task 9.  Environmental Impact Analysis
Task 10.  Prepare Implementation Plan and Schedule
Task 11.  Financing Plan Development
Task 12.  Feasibility Study Report Preparation (including a development impact analysis)

The project cost is estimated at $43 million, depending on the final technology used.  Should the feasibility study prove positive, the World Bank is potentially interested in contributing financing and serving as the primary coordinator of donor aid for the project. 
The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $281,790 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@ustda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Communications and Information Agency of Uzbekistan, c/o U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209, Attention: E-Government Implementation Plan and Taxation Pilot in Uzbekistan  :  The Communications and Information Agency of Uzbekistan (UzACI) invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct technical assistance on an e-government implementation plan and taxation pilot in Uzbekistan.  In addition to evaluating current e-government strategies and policies and benchmarking them against other countries, the technical assistance will include organizing a government-wide workshop to discuss the current infrastructure and future options for e-government; developing a conceptual design and defining technical requirements for a target e-government enterprise architecture; conducting an environmental assessment; and elaborating a strategic e-government implementation plan.  The technical assistance will also cover the development and implementation of an e-taxation pilot program in Syrdarya, a small city near Tashkent.

Over the past few years, development of the information and communications technology (ICT) sector in Uzbekistan has become a major priority for the Government of Uzbekistan and one of the primary factors for the country’s economic growth.  A 2002 Presidential Decree called for the widespread introduction of IT technologies, including the creation of e-government, throughout the country.  Uzbekistan developed a National ICT Strategy as a result.  The ICT Strategy addresses many issues, such as increased efficiency in government management operations through electronic technologies, establishing an environment for free access to information, and enhancing intergovernmental communications.  However, it remains more of a vision statement than a concrete, sequential implementation plan.  Efforts have not been coordinated among government ministries and agencies, and most of the systems that have already been implemented are incompatible with one another.  The Government of Uzbekistan has not been keeping centralized statistics on the current state of ICT penetration, and critical legislation needed for e-government implementation has not yet been adopted.

With these needs in mind, the Government of Uzbekistan now recognizes that it is necessary to establishing a comprehensive e-government strategy and implementation plan separate from overall ICT development.  The Cabinet of Ministers and UzACI have requested assistance in developing an implementation plan that would define the Government of Uzbekistan’s current IT and organizational environment, and provide a sequencing plan for transitioning from the current to the targeted IT architecture, including coordination of government efforts; enhancement of networks and information systems; and development of new applications.  Such a plan must also realistically assess existing human resources capabilities and outline training needs.  In 2003, USTDA sponsored a Defintional Mission that recommended technical assistance to address these issues.  

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this technical assistance will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $502,600 grant to UzACI from USTDA.


A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.

<DESC>Should offerors require additional clarification, contact FedBid.com at 877-933-3243 or clientservices@fedbid.com or Barbara Kennedy at barbara.kennedy@fda.hhs.gov. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is M10270 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The government plans to award a commercial item purchase order to the bidder with the most advantageous bid to the government. Therefore, all bidders MUST submit their best price and best delivery capabilities through www.FedBid.com. The Food and Drug Administration requires the following items to be delivered weekly (every Monday morning unless Monday is a holiday, then delivery shall occur on Tuesday of that week): 2500 lbs of dry ice in rice pellet form to be divided among 9 small bins and 1 large bin located at the NIH campus, Building 29A, loading dock, Bethesda, MD and 1110 lbs of dry ice nuggets to be delivered to Nicholson Lane Research Center at 5516 Nicholson Lane, Rockville, MD 20895. This requirement is set-aside for small businesses only under NAICS 424690 with a size standard of 500 employees for Government contracting. The Government intends to conduct an on-line competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by a third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid.com. FedBid.com has developed an on-line, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. Participants will submit a series of quotes, which descend in price during the specified period of time. All responsible sources MUST submit a quote/offer to the FDA for M10270 using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. Offerors that are not currently registered to use FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Offerors that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. The Government is taking this action in an effort to improve vendor access and awareness of requests while expediting its ability to gather multiple, competed, real-time quotes for products. Offerors may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the bidding process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive bidding process. The reverse auction will start on August 9, 2004 and end on August 12, 2004 at 2:00:00 PM ET. FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The selected offeror MUST submit a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.arnet.gov/far.

Buyers and Sellers agree to use FedBid.com as an independent Venue for buying and selling goods or services, respectively. It is understood that FedBid ranks all bids by price, regardless of the evaluation criteria used by the buyer. Buyers and Sellers understand that a Buyer always maintains all rights assigned under their contracting authority and/or applicable acquisition regulations, and may select the most advantageous bid for the government’s purpose while considering offline factors such as delivery, past performance, socio-economic classifications, and source rotation.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with, Integrated Laboratory Systems, Inc., P.O. Box 13501, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, through a modification to extend the expiration date for work assignments 1 through 5 and work assignment 7 of the subject contract up to May 2, 2005.  In addition the expiration date for work assignment 6 Special Projects will be extended until August 15, 2005.  The authority for this action is FAR 6.302-1 (41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), (HSSAR 306.302-1).  The level of effort will be increased by approximately 12,000 labor hours.  The contractor shall furnish services, appropriately trained and qualified professional, technical, administrative and clerical personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities not otherwise provided by the Government to provide pathology support for the NIEHS and the National Toxicology Program (NTP).  All projects performed under this contract that involve the processing of pathology specimens and the generation and/or review of pathology data shall be conducted and documented following procedures that provide for independent reconstruction of the work performed.  The specimens and records resulting from such work shall be routinely incorporated into the archival records for the respective studies.  The work performed shall be under the following general categories: 1) Pathology Working Groups reviews for NTP pre-chronic and chronic studies and in-house NIEHS studies, 2) Necropsy, Histology, and Histopathological interpretations, 3) entry of pathology data generated from the initial Histopathological evaluation of tissues and the peer review into a  special computer program, 4) perform wet tissue examination and inventory including verification of animal identification, tissue accountability, gross lesion identification and description, assessment of quality and thoroughness of tissue trimming, and slide/block and wet tissue match-up, 5) assign two experienced histotechnicians to work on-site at NIEHS facilities to prepare high quality histologic slides from rodent and human tissues, 6) perform a variety of more specialized and sophisticated techniques in cellular and molecular biology which shall include characterization of non-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions by special stain techniques, ultrastructural examination, or routine immunohistochemistry, such as for the determination of cell proliferation indices using bromodeoxyuridine or proliferation cell nuclear antigen immunohistochemistry, and the adaptation of new immunohistochemical methods for evaluation of pathology specimens using formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded section and/or frozen tissue.  Have the capability of developing, adapting, and refining and applying new techniques in cellular and molecular biology and pathology such as in situ  hybridization, DNA amplification using proliferative chain reaction (PCR) and in situ  PCR (IS-PCR), and familiarity with RNA techniques such as quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (rtPCR).  Develop new state-of-the-art techniques or procedures for investigating chemical-induced toxicity and/or carcinogenicity to accommodate changing and future program requirements, to include providing study management and clinical technical/laboratory support, 7) provide an on-site senior technician with established experience in histology, rodent necropsy, and immunohistochemistry development to provide tissue collection at necropsy, prescribe appropriate tissue handling and fixation for immunohistochemistry, tissue recognition at the light microscopic level as well as the ability to identify lesions, and have proficiency with microscopy and photomicroscopy.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in the operation of this contract make competition unfeasible for the work required.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a non-competitive, sole source purchase order to Westar Display Technologies, Inc. for a Gray-Level Response Time Measurement Kit.  The display temporal measurement system needs to be capable of measuring black-to-white and gray-to-gray response times in the range between a few and 200 milliseconds. For measuring gray level response times accurately, a video generator that synchronizes with the luminance-measuring device (LMD) is required. In order to measure fast transitions between gray levels, a fast LMD is needed (photo-multiplier tube or equivalent). The instrument needs to have a serial or USB computer interface. Software for controlling data acquisition, signal processing to reduce noise, and analyzing waveforms to determine response time is also required. The software should be capable of selecting many different experiments (i.e., measuring a few gray level transitions or the full 256 or 8-bit grayscale). The results should be expressed in terms of the GLRT (gray-level response time) according to the VESA Flat Panel Display Measurements Standard (version 2.0, June 1, 2001). This is not a formal request for quotes.  However, the evaluation of other offers and any award decision will be made on a best value basis.  The FDA intends to make an award immediately after the response date of this notice.

<DESC>The Defense Distribution Depot Jacksonville, Florida (DDJF) provides materiel distribution services including the receipt, storage and issuance of materiel. 

The Contractor shall provide the materiel distribution services performed at DDJF.  This includes all management, personnel and supervision in addition to materiel, tools, equipment and transportation, and any other items and services not government-furnished.  The DDJF depot consists of two sites, one located at Naval Air Station (NAS) Jacksonville and one at Naval Station (NS) Mayport.  These sites are approximately 40 miles apart. At NAS Jacksonville, DDJF has warehouses and operations in the North area, South area, and inside NAVAIR Jacksonville satellites.  The North and South areas are approximately 3 miles apart.

The major commodities are airframe structural components for gas turbine and jet engines, bearings, fittings and specialties, non-powered valves, electronic assemblies, boards, cards, radioactive materiel, industrial/general supplies, repairables, aircraft engine fuel systems components, replacement parts for military equipment and aircraft engines. 

The Contractor shall be responsible for managing and operating the Materiel Processing Center (MPC) Operation for all assigned ships home-ported at Naval Station Mayport, FL and any additional assigned visiting ships to the local geographical area.  The MPC Operation is a customer focused distribution support operation that specializes in receiving and processing materiel that is to be stowed aboard ships.  This operation views each ship as containing floating warehouse(s) and work center(s) that requires the materiel to be moved from the MPC to shipside in a manner and configuration that reduces to the greatest extent possible the level of effort needed by the shipboard personnel to finish the stow action.  Materiel being delivered to a ship or diverted from one ship to another may be destined for the ship or a unit or squadron being deployed with the ship.  

The Defense Distribution Center is seeking offeror’s to perform the above functions on a best value basis. The solicitation is expected to be released on or about June 15, 2004. The resultant contract will be awarded on an all or none basis as a Time and Materials with Award Fee, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract. The term of the contract consists of a two-year base period and three one-year option periods.   

The NAICS Code and Size Standard is 493110 and $21.5 million, respectively. A site visit and pre-proposal conference will be conducted at DDJF on June 2 and 3, 2004. The attached form must be completed FAXed at the numbers printed on the top of the form by May 27, 2004 at 3:00 p.m. EST. A video tape of the Distribution Standard System (DSS) will be presented in conjunction with the site visit/pre-proposal conference. Interested parties should contact Dennis Luquette by email at dennis.luquette@dla.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This action is cancelled.  In support of the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) enterprise approach to the procurement of information technology support services, DHS is developing a new department-wide strategy for acquisition.  The Department’s decision to pursue a new strategy requires the cancellation of the U.S. Coast Guard’s planned “SPIRIT” procurement, which was first conceived prior to the formation of DHS.  In 2005, the Department of Homeland Security anticipates awarding many contracts for information technology support.  The Department’s revised information technology support services acquisition strategy will emphasize the integration of information across all Homeland Security agencies.

<DESC>This is the 6th modification to the synopsis initially issued 16 March 2004 under solicitation number H92222-04-R-0024 for Electro-Optical System/Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) for use on USSOCOM Combatant Craft.  As a result of questions concerning cost and pricing data, the following clarification is provided:
   
        a.  The information required by RFP Attachment (1) and Attachment (3) are merely prices required for evaluation purposes.
        b.  It is not expected that cost and pricing data will be required.  
        c.  However, should circumstances cause the Contracting Officer to determine that price reasonableness cannot be ascertained as by FAR 15.403-3, and then in accordance with RFP clause 5652.215-9010 the Contracting Officer may require the submittal of cost or pricing data.  Should that occur, you may at that time request an exemption per FAR 15.403-1(c)(3).  Per FAR 15.403-1(c)(3), the Contracting Officer will then determine whether the proposed product meets the commercial item definition in FAR 2.101 and price reasonableness can be determined without cost and pricing data.
 
                   RFP H92222-04-R-0024:

 4.3 VOLUME 3-COST/PRICE PROPOSAL.  The offeror shall insert prices for all items/services in Section B of the solicitation completed with applicable firm fixed price or time & material prices.   For the time and material labor rates, the offeror shall insert the labor categories and applicable fully loaded labor rates in attachment (1).   Finally, the offeror shall complete the Price Evaluation Roll-up Sheet, attachment (3). 
 5652.215-9002 Separate Technical and Pricing/Cost Proposals (1998) 
Offerors shall submit separate technical and cost/price volumes.  The technical volume shall not contain cost or pricing data.
 5652.215-9010 Cost and Pricing Data Not Required (1998)
 It is anticipated that adequate price competition will be available to determine price reasonableness.  In the event that the price reasonableness can not be determined based on adequate competition, the Contracting Officer may require the submittal of cost or pricing data in accordance with FAR 15.403. 

The RFP response date remains 6 Aug 2004.  It is the responsibility of all interested parties to continually monitor the website to stay informed.

<DESC>Engineering Field Activity Southeast/ROICC Jacksonville is seeking interest from 8(a) firms participants with bona-fide places of business in the northeast Florida area or southeast Georgia area within 50 miles of Naval Submarine Base, Kings Bay. The Navy is targeting the issuance of approximately fifteen (15) Basic Ordering Agreement's (BOA's). The estimated period of performance will be three (3) years with the Government reserving the right to grant extensions for up to two years, with no single extension exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c). BOA's are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the US Small Business Administration (SBA)district offices. The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between EFASE/ROICC (NAVY) and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The BOA holders will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA, and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order. On an annual basis, the NAVY and SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of (a) the usefulness and need for service, and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only, to the BOA holders for submission of a proposal. If the parties are able to come to an agreement, a contractual document, i.e. task order, will be issued and the BOA holder will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the task order, as directed by the Contracting Officer. Competition for the BOA task orders shall be restricted to the BOA holders in the SBA District noted. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement, but there is a threshold minimum of not less than $2,500.00 that can be placed on a task order with a maximum of $3,000,000.00. The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, will consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $100,000.00 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order over $25,000.00. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the BOA holder or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire services from he BOA holders only. DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The anticipated work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. Covered work includes, but is not limited to, the following types. EMERGENCY REPAIRS: Broken and leaking water lines, gas lines, sewers, storm drains, electric power lines, phone lines, associated structures, interior building repairs, broken doors and windows, etc. exterior repairs, roof leaks, related repairs caused by wind damage, flooding, etc., mechanical problems.

DESIGN: On-site design solutions for emergency calls and Design/Build Services for minor construction items. The NAICS sub sectors assigned to the subject BOA requirements are 233,234,235,236,237 and 238. Each BOA may also contain a sole source provision to authorize the acquisition of emergency repairs and solutions to emergency calls relative to design/build services for minor construction items. GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers military installations within the Engineering Field Activity Southeast (EFASE) area of responsibility, including NAS Jacksonville, NS Mayport, and Naval Submarine Base, Kings Bay, GA. The agreements will be written for a period of three (3) years. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. IF a firm is graduating from the 8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the BOIA holder and the BOA will terminate. Termination of the BOA under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued. Either party may cancel the BOA with 30 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued orders. The BOA holders maybe required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Navy approval as well as a price proposal. SOLICITATIONS: Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror. The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown at any time. ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract. SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS:(1) Provide 8(a) Certification and applicable district or an 8(a) participant with a bona-fide place of business in either location; (2) Registered in the Department of Defense Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database; contractors may visit the CCR website at http://www.ccr2000.com/ for information on registering and checking the CCR; (3)Licensed/Bonded and fully capable to perform construction work under the NAICS Codes stated above which will be identified with each potential task order requirement.

<DESC>*****Solicitation Number SB1341-04-R-0019 is hereby amended in order to respond to a technical question from a vendor.  QUESTION:  In Section C - page 7, it is specified that we must supply a dryer with a 20ft. drying path. In section C - Page 10 it also specifies that the maximum dimensions for the complete line (Unit Size) are not to exceed 46 inches wide by 73 inches long by 73.5 inches high. Is there a typographical error in one of these sections, or did the specifying group possible make an error in their requirement? Due to normal design constraints, a 20ft. drying path will not fit in the envelope defined by these maximum unit dimensions.  RESPONSE:  The dimensions indicated in Section C on pages 7 and 10 of the specification are correct. A dryer can be designed with a drying path of 20 feet that fits within the allowed maximum dimensions of 73 inches long by 73.5 inches high by 46 inches wide.
*****ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS SHALL REMAIN UNCHANGED AND IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.*****

<DESC>The Defense Distribution Depot Jacksonville, Florida (DDJF) provides materiel distribution services including the receipt, storage and issuance of materiel. 

The Contractor shall provide the materiel distribution services performed at DDJF.  This includes all management, personnel and supervision in addition to materiel, tools, equipment and transportation, and any other items and services not government-furnished.  The DDJF depot consists of two sites, one located at Naval Air Station (NAS) Jacksonville and one at Naval Station (NS) Mayport.  These sites are approximately 40 miles apart. At NAS Jacksonville, DDJF has warehouses and operations in the North area, South area, and inside NAVAIR Jacksonville satellites.  The North and South areas are approximately 3 miles apart.

The major commodities are airframe structural components for gas turbine and jet engines, bearings, fittings and specialties, non-powered valves, electronic assemblies, boards, cards, radioactive materiel, industrial/general supplies, repairables, aircraft engine fuel systems components, replacement parts for military equipment and aircraft engines. 

The Contractor shall be responsible for managing and operating the Materiel Processing Center (MPC) Operation for all assigned ships home-ported at Naval Station Mayport, FL and any additional assigned visiting ships to the local geographical area.  The MPC Operation is a customer focused distribution support operation that specializes in receiving and processing materiel that is to be stowed aboard ships.  This operation views each ship as containing floating warehouse(s) and work center(s) that requires the materiel to be moved from the MPC to shipside in a manner and configuration that reduces to the greatest extent possible the level of effort needed by the shipboard personnel to finish the stow action.  Materiel being delivered to a ship or diverted from one ship to another may be destined for the ship or a unit or squadron being deployed with the ship.  

The Defense Distribution Center is seeking offeror’s to perform the above functions on a best value basis. The solicitation is expected to be released on or about June 15, 2004.

The contractor will be required to manage and direct programs to support a broad spectrum of programmatic activities that are supportive of the DOE mission. The primary activities include: 1. Epidemiologic research ? Conduct comprehensive epidemiologic studies of current and former DOE and DOE contractor employees whose occupations involve(d) potential exposure to radiation or toxic materials or other populations. 2. Independent environmental assessment and verification ?

DOE anticipates awarding a similar type of contract. In addition, the contractor must maintain certain research, training, educational, and support facilities provided by the Government and contractor. Specific tasks will be assigned in accordance with DOE direction and may include work for DOE and work for other DOE contractors, Federal agencies, and/or non-Federal entities that are related to the mission of the contract.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is using this sources sought synopsis to encourage exchange of information with industry concerning transformation of current Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) capabilities into a force protection system capable of engaging air and surface threats. The Marine Corps desires to identify potential solutions and gather technical and cost information to plan and budget for this capability. The system should be capable of detection, identification and engagement of traditional and asymmetric air and ground threats (ultra-lights, unmanned aerial vehicles, private aircraft, cruise missiles, helicopters, fixed wing aircraft, pickup trucks and/or vans armed with explosives, fixed emplacements, and boats, etc.). The following are the tentative requirements of the system: (a) The system must support operational concepts such as Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare (EMW), Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM), and Operational Maneuver From The Sea (OMFTS); (b) It should be modular, scalable and capable of meeting distributed operational requirements (a man-portable capability is desirable); (c) The system’s primary role will be in support of Ground-to-Air (G-A) missions, with a secondary role supporting Ground-to-surface (G-G) missions; (d) The system shall be capable of operation in all environmental conditions, day and night. (e) The system must be capable of surviving environments associated with air drop (e.g. thermal shock, pressure change, moisture/condensation penetration, water submersion, shock and vibration); (f) The system must be sufficiently ruggedized to withstand and/or be protected from the abrasive effects (e.g. pitting and scratching) and the penetration of blowing sand and dust particles while operating. The design of the system should also prohibit the penetration of water, moisture, condensation, and salt spray; (g) The system must be fully capable of conducting worldwide operations in conventional and contingency combat operations including tactical nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare environments. It should be designed for use with mission oriented protective posture clothing level (4) and also compatible with current protective helmets and masks; (h) The system must have provisions for use with an Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system. The IFF must work in Joint, Interagency, and Multinational (JIM) environments; (i) The system shall comply with applicable safety, health and human engineering requirements and shall not present uncontrolled safety and health hazards to personnel; (j) The system should provide for interface compatibility with current air and ground sensors; (k) The system needs to be compatible w/existing and future USMC/Joint organizations. The system must be capable of functioning as a node in the future net-centric environment. There is no funded requirement at this time. However, it is the Government's intent to encourage exchange of information to improve the Government's understanding of industry capabilities and existing and potential technologies in order to determine a realistic capability solution. It is the Government’s intent to form a Government-Industry Working Group to discuss the capabilities and potential performance specifications. All interested companies are invited to participate. This will provide industry a valuable opportunity for input, questions, and answers. Time is available for one-on-one exchanges between a contractor and the Government team during 14 through 18 June 2004, to discuss the contractor's thoughts on how the Working Group process should be implemented (white papers will be accepted), and address questions on potential capabilities, (contractor to provide in writing and softcopy in MSWORD 6.0). Any additional contractor briefings (to include capabilities briefings) will be limited to issues related to transformation of current Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) capability into a force protection system against both air and surface threats. Due to the limited time, the 1-on-1 meetings will be set up on a first-come-first-served basis. Participation is limited to 5 industry representatives per meeting. Other exchanges may take place at a later date. These meetings will take place at the Research Center at Quantico Marine Corps Base. To set up appointments for the one-on-one exchanges, please call Valerie Mosqueira at (703) 432-4192 or send email to Valerie Mosqueira at mosqueiravj@mcsc.usmc.mil with a copy to Jon Reznicek at reznicekJJ@mcsc.usmc.mil subject 1-on-1 exchanges, request should be received not later than 10 June 2004. Confirmation will be sent via e-mail and will include directions and points of contact for assistance. The meeting will be unclassified. No acquisition strategy will be discussed. Participation is totally voluntary, and the government will not reimburse the attendees for any cost associated with participation and is under no obligation to award any related contract associated with this event.

<DESC>The President's Commission on Implementation of U.S. Space Exploration Policy forwarded its report "A Journey to Inspire, Innovate and Discover" to the President on June 4, 2004. In that report, the Commission made a number of recommendations concerning the future missions and structure of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).  Of particular note on the structure of the Agency, the Commission recommended that NASA consider reconfiguring its Centers as Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) to enable innovation, to work effectively with the private sector, and to stimulate economic development.  NASA is interested in receiving comments and ideas from all sources regarding the possible reconfiguring of its Centers, including whether to transform its Centers to FFRDCs or other alternative management structures, that would enable its Centers to become more flexible and nimble in implementing the Agency’s mission in the most effective manner possible.  Comments and ideas should address how the proposed reconfiguration will reflect NASA Values and could create institutional incentives that continuously align performance with Agency mission needs, enable personnel practices that place sufficient priority on innovation, professional growth, and managerial mobility, stimulate private sector involvement, and enable the reduction of duplicative capabilities that unnecessarily raise NASA’s cost to the taxpayer.  Reference: NASA Values can be found on the NASA Website at: http://www.nasa.gov/about/highlights/nasa_values.html Reference: The NASA Website includes a copy of the Report of the President’s Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy, “A Journey to Inspire, Innovate, and Discover”.  http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/60736main_M2M_report_small.pdf  Questions concerning this RFI may be submitted via e-mail no later than August 12, 2004, 5:00 PM EDT to jedmond@hq.nasa.gov. Responses to the questions will be posted no later than August 19, 2004.  Responses to this Request for Information (RFI) and ideas may lead to a decision to compete study contracts or other follow-on work to implement this recommendation. Responses should be sent to Jerry Edmond at the address shown below.  Responses to this Request for Information are due August 31, 2004.  Respondents shall provide a hard copy submission to the address below as well as an electronic submission to the email address given below.   Responses are hereby limited to 20 pages.

<DESC>The Navy is conducting market research for academic skills software for Navy Sailors.  The software shall consist of a curriculum containing English, mathematics, reading, and life skills.  The curriculum shall be developed specifically for adult students, and should be presented in a logical sequence that builds upon basic concepts, reinforces appropriate training, and comprehensively instructs in the subjects from the second grade through 12th.  For the purposes of this market research, it is not necessary that software be comprised of all four subjects nor cover all grade levels.  
It is requested that the software be on a standard CD, capable of operating in a standard Windows (XP or later) environment, on a laptop or desktop machine with a minimum of 256MB of RAM, in a standard CD drive (minimum X48 speed).  Evaluation copies being requested at this time need not be LAN enabled; in a resultant solicitation this would be a requirement.  The software is to be utilized on both standalone computers, and on ship or shore LANs.     

The software should be user friendly and student interactive.  It should allow for an initial on-line assessment and automatic placement of the student at the appropriate educational level.  The software should be free of typographical errors, with easy to read print, and should allow students to bookmark lessons so that they can return later to the same place.  There should be a logical and apparent course structure, with mandatory portions or sequences of instruction readily identifiable, and capable of being bookmarked, so that students can bookmark lessons and return to the same place in the lessons for the next session.   Touch points, screen options, student instructions and interactions and confirmation of selections and feedback should be consistent throughout the lessons so that the student interacts with the material being presented, not with the training system.  Student should be branched to alternate paths, dependent upon performance needs, levels of experience or knowledge.  The software should allow for placement test results and recommend student's track through the courseware.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is conducting sources sought synopsis to locate organizations providing services to plan, coordinate and promote National Primary Care Week (NPCW) 2005 across the Nation at health professions training programs. 

The purpose of National Primary Care Day was to provide an opportunity for a national celebration of generalist physicians in order to emphasize their continued important roles in our health care delivery system, recognize their contribution to health and society, and help raise the image and status of primary care careers.  Students worked with faculty and administrators to organize activities and increase support for primary care.  During its four-year existence, the annual NPCD activities increased the visibility of primary care careers while highlighting the depth and breadth of the primary care and generalist disciplines at academic health centers and medical campuses across the United States

The new initiative has continued to build on the strengths of past experience, include all health professions students, and collaborate with organizations that have a vested interest in primary care.  The initiative is consistent with the HRSA mission to ensure a quality workforce to meet the health needs of the nation, especially those of vulnerable populations.  HRSA is committed to education and training of primary care physicians and other health professionals.  Having adequate numbers of health professionals prepared in primary care is crucial to improving access to health care.  The support from a variety of professional and educational discipline-specific primary care organizations further ensures the potential benefits of NPCW activities.  

The outcomes of this initiative are important to HRSA, its programs and mission, particularly within the Bureau of Health Professions because of the potential to enhance the ongoing activities that support increasing opportunities to expose students to career choices in primary care.  For example, innovative collaboration with the national network of the Area Health Education Centers Program to develop and promote NPCW has resulted in increased marketing of the successful interdisciplinary, community-based AHEC Program while providing a vehicle to move health professions education beyond academic campuses and into communities.

Interested organizations should submit their capability statements demonstrating their capability 
to perform this work in sufficient detail to assess their ability.  Potential contractors must have experience in health professions student organizations.  Experience in collaborative development efforts with other primary care disciplines aimed at encouraging students to consider careers in primary care. Experience in the health care facilities system and educational requirements.  Must have experience in organizing meetings and group events.  Must have the ability to generate material in a timely and efficient manner.

Interested organizations must demonstrate and document in any capability statements submitted, extensive experience with, and the ability to perform, the above tasks.  Organizations should demonstrate capability to administer and coordinate interrelated tasks in an effective and timely manner.  Documentation may include Government and commercial contracts, providing references (with names, telephone numbers, and email address) and any other information serving to document the organization’s capability.


You submission must be received in this office by 2:00 PM on August 16, 2004 by post office mail, email, or fax to the following address:  HHS/HRSA; Attn:  Diane Coger; 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 13A-19; Rockville, MD 20857; telephone number (301) 443-2583; fax number (301) 443-5462; dcoger@hrsa.gov.  The capability statements shall not be more than twenty-five (25) pages on 8.5” x 11” with 1” margins and a 12-point font size.

Slap segmentation is the process by which a single image containing four fingerprint images is divided into four images of the individual fingers.

Potential sources of such software will neither be funded by NIST, nor charged by NIST, to participate in SlapSeg04.  Rules for SlapSeg04 participants are outlined in the HOW TO PARTICIPATE page at http://fingerprint.nist.gov/slapseg04.  A deadline for submission is shown on the CALENDAR page of http://fingerprint.nist.gov/slapseg04.

The program is administered jointly between the two organizations.   Fellows work within NCHS and with AcademyHealth to strengthen their knowledge of current and emerging health policy concerns, and at the same time, encourage the use of NCHS data in responding to health policy questions.  In 2000, NCHS and AcademyHealth partnered to develop and implement a joint fellowship program aimed at the health services research community.  Its objective was to foster use of NCHS data systems to study issues of concern to health policymakers and the health services researchers.  To do so, the two organizations developed a program that would bring two fellows to NCHS each year to conduct research and to participate in health policy training activities with AcademyHealth.   This procurement will recruit and select the fourth cohort of fellows for the program.  After completion of the recruitment and selection process, it is anticipated that the fourth cohort will begin their appointments sometime between September, 2005 and May, 2006.  The procurement will cover the period from Mid August 2004 – September 30, 2006.   Our aim is to begin production of publicity as soon as possible with formal announcement of the program in August 2004.

All materials relating to this contract are the sole property of the government and shall be returned to the government at the completion of work.

<SUBJECT>J -- Provide Tower Space and Maintenance Services for the NOAA Weather Radio System in the State of New Mexico
<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/ National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS) to negotiate with the State of New Mexico, General Service Department, Office of Communications, located at P.O. Drawer 26110, Santa Fe, NM  87502 for tower space and preventative and remedial maintenance of NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) transmitters, antennae and transmission lines located at eight (8) State of New Mexico owned tower sites located in New Mexico in Albuquerque, Clovis, Ruidoso, Des Moines, Hobbs, Farmington, Las Cruces and Santa Fe.  BACKGROUND: In a January 1975 White House Policy Statement, NOAA’s NWR was designated the sole government operated radio alert system to provide direct warnings into private homes for both natural disasters and nuclear attack. The mandate requires uninterrupted transmission capability 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Since 1994, the State of New Mexico has had access to NWR service through successive contracts between the NOAA/NWS and the State of New Mexico. SCOPE: This procurement is for a follow-on contract for tower space and maintenance services.     PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The contract to be negotiated is for a one year base period of performance, followed by four 1-year option periods for a total of 5 years. SOLE SOURCE: NOAA/NWS has determined that the State of New Mexico is the only contractor that can provide 1) tower space on strategically located towers and allow for placement of antennas at the needed heights to provide the required NWR broadcast service coverage. 2) The State of New Mexico is the only contractor that can provide the 24 hours per day, 365 days per year maintenance services since no other contractor can have access to the towers and equipment for maintenance after hours due to Homeland Security issues. Since outages and emergencies can occur at any time day or night, access to the sites for maintenance must be available 24 hours a day. This is not a formal solicitation.  This notice may represent the only notice. The acquisition is a commercial item acquisition. See note 22.

<SUBJECT>84 -- FPI Production in FS Group 84
<DESC>This notice announces the decision regarding FPI’s production in Federal Supply (FS) Group  84 - Clothing, Individual Equipment, and Insignia.  FPI’s new product/significant expansion guidelines were published March 12, 1997, in the Federal Register.  A provision of the guidelines allows for FPI to exceed a specific product’s expansion threshold in cases of a public exigency, such as a national defense emergency.  The guidelines require that FPI receive a specific order or request from the Department of Defense (DoD) or Executive Branch officials for this provision to be invoked.  Upon invoking this provision, the guidelines allow that increased sales resulting from national exigencies will not be considered a violation of the guidelines ceiling in the year in which they occur.  
	On November 21, 2003, FPI received an official request from the Defense Supply Center, Philadelphia (DSCP).  The correspondence requested FPI to fulfill DoD’s needs for physical fitness uniforms (PFU), which consist of PFU shorts, t-shirts, and sweatshirts and sweatpants for deployed Army troops.   The DoD request states the U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) is coordinating an initiative to issue 200,000 off-duty uniforms for deployed troops which will consist of physical fitness shorts, short-sleeve and long-sleeve t-shirts, as well as sweatshirts and sweatpants.  Following this request, FPI received an additional request for PFU trunks and t-shirts for the Air Force.    In light of the military’s critical need for these items, FPI requested approval to invoke the national exigency provision of the guidelines.  FPI’s BOD approved the national exigency request.  Accordingly, sales in PFU shorts, t-shirts, sweatshirts, and sweatpants may temporarily exceed the guidelines ceiling without constituting a guidelines violation.  
	FPI’s approved production level for PFUs includes limits on both sales and units.  The sales ceiling for PFU shorts is $14 million and 1.2 million units.  Based on DoD’s needs, the additional work will cause FPI to exceed its ceiling by over one million units and $5.4 million in FY 2005.  The sales ceiling for t-shirts is $15.1 million for a total of 3.0 million units, (1.4 million units of gray t-shirts and 1.6 million units of brown undershirts).  Based on DoD’s needs, the additional work will cause FPI to exceed the unit ceiling for gray t-shirts by 877,000 and the sales ceiling for t-shirts by $600,000 by FY 2005.  FPI’s FY 2004 sales ceiling for sweatshirts and sweatpants is $15.6 million consisting of 200,000 sweatshirts and 200,000 sweatpants.  Based on DoD’s needs, the additional work would cause FPI to exceed the sales ceiling for sweatshirts and sweatpants by $2.166 million and 51,000 units of sweatshirts and 70,000 units of sweatpants in FY 2004.  	
	It should be noted that the “national exigency” provision is temporary, allowing FPI to exceed the normal sales ceiling while the exigency is in effect.  It does not authorize FPI to utilize the higher level as a future production baseline.  FPI is uncertain as to how long the current exigency will last due to the ongoing military war efforts and the continuing war on terrorism.  At a minimum, however, it is expected that increased production levels as a result of DoD’s expanded needs will continue through the balance of the current fiscal year and into FY 2005.      
	Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI.  Any correspondence should be addressed to: Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation, and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.  Attention: RACS Branch.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. i) The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Administrative Support Center intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with StormCenter Communications, Inc., Ellicott City, MD, for services to enhance the public's understanding about watershed and coastal processes, issues and events in the Gulf Coast.  This purchase will be done under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized under FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The anticipated award date is August 19, 2004. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes, however; any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within five days from the date of the publication of this synopsis.  Responses received will be evaluated, however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion for the Government.  If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the sole source negotiation.  (i) Requirements:  The contractor shall create innovative methods to substantially increase the public's understanding of watershed and coastal issues, and enhance the recognition of NOAA and National Ocean Service (NOS) related missions and information products.  The outreach services provided by the contractor shall be based on the success of TV weather reporting in attracting the public's attention and disseminating information.  The contractor shall provide on-air stories with accompanying graphics as well as an associated website with in depth information, to create a new effective delivery mechanism for environmental news and information.  Two pilot projects for the Gulf Coast states, one in the New Orleans area and one in the Tampa Bay area, shall extend the StormCenter Communications watershed Web site project - Watersheds-Where the Atmosphere Meets the Earth currently in place at WRC-TV4 in Washington, D.C., and KYW-TV in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to New Orleans, Louisiana, and Tampa, Florida.  The project would run for a one-year period on date of award.  The partnership with StormCenter Communications will lead to increased visibility and improved delivery of NOS products and services via greater exposure through television broadcasts of local weather and development of a Web site.  These media outlets will expand access to and utilization of NOS-related data and information.  Three mechanisms of information delivery will be created for the proposed New Orleans and Tampa venue:  1) through on-air news stories via the local TV station, 2) through an interactive content-rich Web site with links to NOAA and NOS where appropriate and 3) through StormCenter's Envirocast™ Bulletins which will provide focused satellite imagery related to the two watersheds and the Gulf of Mexico. StormCenter Communications will work with a local New Orleans and Tampa television station, the National Ocean Service, and other local and regional organizations to develop the necessary content, relevant environmental news stories, Web material and Envirocast's.  The overall goal is to deliver accurate and relevant information to the public that is based on or related to NOS data and products.  For direct on-air use by the station meteorologist and/or news team, StormCenter will rely on its established delivery technology, Envirocast™ and on-line technology.  The Contractor shall provide the following services:  (1) Recruit local television stations and local broadcast meteorologists in the New Orleans and Tampa areas for participation in the project.  (2) Organize a meeting between NOS, the participating station broadcast meteorologists and news management along with representatives from local scientific organizations and NOAA National Weather Service Forecast Offices in the  pilot areas.  The purpose of the meeting is to introduce the project and determine what type of NOAA/NOS data and products are best suited for public dissemination. The meeting will also be 
used to discuss how observations and products can be used on air and what future data might be available or desired.  (3) Provide the general public with background information about the 
Lower Mississippi River and Tampa Bay Watersheds and related forests and coasts.  The contractor shall create the content and graphics for the Watershed Web site, including, About Watersheds, Forests Matter, Along the Coast chapters and Our Watershed( provides focused information on the New Orleans and Tampa watersheds and Gulf coast).  (4) Create satellite imagery for the Lower Mississippi River Watershed, its sub-watersheds and the Gulf of Mexico. The contractor shall create a section of the element of the website  " Find your local watershed" which allows the Web user to put in their zip code and generate a variety of maps - a satellite image of the entire Lower Mississippi River Watershed and Tampa Bay Watershed, a satellite image of a specific sub-watershed and a digital elevation model.  It also provides access to local Forest Cover and bathymetry for the Gulf of Mexico.  The contractor shall collect and merge several different types of satellite images from NOAA, NASA and other government agencies to create one merged image for use on the "on the air (TV ready)" and on the watershed Web site. Similar chapters can be found on the Watershed- Where the Atmosphere Meets the Earth Web
 site < http://kyw.iewatershed.com >. The contractor will also include a weekly Envirocast™ On-line element of the website which each week will provide Earth Observation and Coastal imagery from around the globe, and when applicable in the local watershed and coastal regions to address important issues related to our environment.  (5) To reach the New Orleans and Tampa viewing audience on a regular basis with information about the Lower Mississippi River Watershed and Gulf Coast, one locally focused Environmental News Story idea per month will be provided to the partner television station along with TV ready satellite images and other visuals that can be easily incorporated into the local weathercast.  Topics shall highlight recent/breaking news events - drought updates, oil spills, water alerts, harmful algal blooms, 
invasive species, coastal erosion, sea level rise, agricultural run-off, fish runs, bird migrations as well as information related to winter storms, tropical storms, hurricanes, and other natural 
hazards.  Any on-air stories will refer the public to television station Website for more in depth information.  (6) The contractor shall work with the local TV station(s) on the formal launch of 
the project. Activities will include ideas and actions for planning an on-air interview or story and press releases from the project partners as appropriate.  The launch shall take place once the content and graphics have been completed.  Printing:  All printing will be done by the NOS.  Contractor will not be reimbursed for printing expenses.  Contractor may provide NOS a master copy of any materials that may need to be printed.  
Place of Performance: The contract services for the special study shall take place at the contractor's facility and also in locations to be determined for any future workshops and meetings that may need to take place at the request of CSC.

Proposal Page/Format Limitation:  Limit your proposal to the following:

(i)	10 Pages - Technical
(ii)	2 Pages – Resumes
(iii)	1 Page Per Agency – Past Performance (Up to three (3) Agencies)
(iv)	5 Pages – Sample Course of Instruction

Period of Performance:  Five (5) year period of performance from date of award.

*** BEGIN 52.212-2 ADDENDUM - EVALUATION FACTORS *** 

(1) The first phase of the evaluation will consist of a review of the submitted proposals to determine whether or not the proposals comply with all solicitation requirements identified in the Performance of Work Statement (PWS) section of the solicitation. Failure to meet all solicitation requirements may result in elimination from further evaluation and consideration.

(2) The second phase of the evaluation will be comprised of three areas: Technical, Past Performance, and Price. The Technical Area Criteria are:  Development/Implementation of Curriculum and Demonstration of Types of Training. Technical is more important than Past Performance.  Technical and Past Performance when combined are more important than price. Offerors must note the evaluation of development/implementation of curriculum and demonstration of types of training will be essentially a subjective assessment by the technical evaluators. 

Technical Evaluation:  

Curriculum Development/Implementation and Training Plans – 

a) Demonstrates and identifies experiences and core competencies with expertise in developing and 
implementing Programs of Instruction (POI) using adult education methodologies.  Of particular importance is expertise in technical surveillance tactics and strategies. 

      b) Demonstrates the Offeror’s strengths and ability to develop technical surveillance training  
      programs of instruction. 

c) Identifies a systematic plan to achieve course objectives within specified timelines and funding constraints

Demonstration of Types of Training – 

       a) Experiences, core competencies, tools, and proficient personnel expertise is demonstrated and identified to  
support the types of training stated in this solicitation. 

b) Examples of such training are discussed and demonstrated in enough detail in the proposals to indicate success.  

c) The information provided demonstrates unequivocally the Offeror's strengths and ability to conduct training in the area of technical surveillance.

(4) The Past Performance evaluation includes the Offeror's performance in cost, schedule, and the administrative aspects of performance; the Offeror's history for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; the Offeror's record of compliance with safety, environmental and security laws and regulations; and generally, the Offeror's businesslike concern for the interests of its customers. 

(5) Although price is less important than the other evaluation factors, it is an important factor.  Cost/Price will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror understands the requirements and risks inherent in the scope of work. In addition, Cost/Price will be evaluated to determine the feasibility of performing all the terms and conditions of the offer within the total price proposed by the offeror.

 Cost will be evaluated for completeness, reasonableness and a total evaluated price for the entire length of contract.  When evaluating cost, the Government will determine if: 

·	the proposed cost reasonable for work to be performed;
·	reflect a clear understanding of the requirements of the solicitation; and
·	is consistent with approaches contained in the Offeror's /technical proposal

(6) Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, considering the factors set forth in this solicitation.

(7) Offerors must provide data that specifically addresses all requirements in this solicitation.

1.  1st Special Warfare Group requires construction of two CASA 212 aircraft mock-ups for the purpose of conducting pre-jump rehearsals.  In the past 18 months, this command has experienced two serious airborne malfunctions that would likely have been mitigated with a close facsimile of the jump platform for rehearsals.  To meet this end, Training Group requires the following parameters to be met.

    a.  A close approximation of an actual CASA 212-100 to provide the unit with the most realistic simulation possible. The “fuselage” must be mounted to a 24’ trailer to allow transportation by either an LMTV or a civilian equivalent truck.

    b.  A frame must be fabricated in the cabin overhead, covered in metal and sealed to provide adequate weather protection. In place of 3 ea cabin doors, a canvas or similar material should be fabricated and secured to the fuselage with snaps on the forward and aft sides and permanently attached at the top for weather protection. Provisions must be supplied to roll up the material to provide ventilation while the trainer is in use. 

    c.  A ramp must be installed at the forward hinge attachment points. This ramp should allow for opening and closing during rehearsal and a secure method of ensuring the ramp mechanism remains in place for safety purposes once opened.  The forward fuselage section along with the main landing gear attach point area should be covered in plywood and sealed for weather protection and aesthetics. The entire fuselage must be inspected for cuts and damage and repaired as appropriate. 

    d.  The cabin floor panels should be fabricated from plywood or other non-slip material.  18 troop seats must be installed along the sidewalls in the standard configuration. The troop seats must be stow-able and come complete with seat belts.

    e.	The fuselage must be equipped with a static line and retrieval system that is fully comparable to systems currently in use. A jump bell and jump light system must be installed in the positions of their standard configuration. The actual location of the switches and battery can be determined based on engineering requirements and consultation with the unit.

    f.  Delivery/Set-Up to be on Fort Bragg, North Carolina. 28310.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented by additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued.   The solicitation number is RA1341-04-RP-4034 and issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24.    The NAICS Code is 334515.  Any amendment(s) hereto will only be published in the FedBizOpps.   A. BACKGROUND:
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Quantum Electrical Metrology Division has a requirement for a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to be used in combination with existing electron beam lithography (EBL) software to create a state-of-the-art research EBL and imaging system.  This system will replace NIST’s existing microscope. This instrument will be the primary imaging tool and the only EBL tool for a large user-based Fabrication Facility.  The present SEM has limitations that need to be resolved in the new instrument.  Much of the work focuses on aluminum devices on silicon and thus have very low contrast in imaging due to their similar Z-numbers. At low acceleration voltages (less than 10 kV) where the contrast is best, the resolution becomes inadequate to characterize these devices properly. In the present system the chamber size and stage travel limit NIST’s ability to easily image or write (EBL) entire wafers (up to 4 inches in diameter).  Finally, the microscope is in a multi-user facility and responsible operation is often difficult to monitor, and is reflected in the typically short filament lifetimes and level of column cleanliness. B.  GENERAL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:  The microscope shall be based on a Schottky emission filament (also known as a thermal field emitter). Thermal field emission microscopes are known to provide excellent resolution, typically better than 3 nm at 1 kV acceleration voltage, and have ultra-stable emission currents making them ideal for EBL.   The microscope shall include all the hardware and software to acquire and view images.  The microscope load lock (if equipped), stage and specimen chamber should accommodate wafers up to 4” (approximately 100 mm) in diameter. The stage travel shall be large enough to scan the entire wafer.  The system shall be equipped with an electrostatic beam blanker and any associated electronics to provide blanking times less than 10 ns. The system must also be easily integrated with the pattern generation software currently licensed NPGS (Nabity Pattern Generation System) to enable EBL.  To ease maintenance in a multi-user environment, the system shall include a cryogenic trap for rapidly out gassing samples to protect the filament. The system shall be pumped by a turbo molecular pump. If the turbo pump is not the standard pumping system on a particular microscope model, all specifications (resolution, vibration, etc.) shall be verified with the turbo pump in operation. C.  TECHNICAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:  1. Performance Specifications:  a) Resolution: less than 3 nm at 1 kV, less than 2 nm at greater than 10kV; b)Emission current drift: less than 1 percent in 12 hours; c)Beam blanker: i. On:Off ratio: greater than 10,000:1, and ii. Rise/fall times: better than 10  ns  d)Stage: i. reproducibility: less than 3 microns, and ii. backlash less than 2 microns.  
2. Hardware and Software Specifications:  a)  Load lock (if equipped) and stage shall accommodate 4” wafers/specimen holders; b) Stage travel shall be large enough to allow viewing/writing of entire 4” wafer; c) Stage vertical (z-axis) range of motion shall be 40 mm or greater; d) Stage shall have digitally encoded knobs to allow user to move stage manually; e) The system shall include an assortment of specimen holders appropriate for
small chips (less than 0.25 inch) and 3” and 4” wafers; f) The specimen chamber shall be pumped by a turbo molecular pump and backed by a dry high speed roughing pump (such as a scroll pump).  If an oil based roughing pump is used, details of how backstreaming will be controlled must be given.   Specimen exchange time must be only a few minutes; g) A cold finger/can shall be provided for additional protection when imaging fast outgassing specimens; h) Operating acceleration voltages:  from less than 1kV to 30 kV; i) Magnification:  from below 15x to 500,000x or greater; j) Detectors: the machine shall come equipped with a back-scattered electron detector in addition to the standard secondary electron detector; k) The beam blanker unit shall be electrostatic and come with any additional amplifiers to provide high on/off ratios (greater than 10,000) with less than 10 ns blanking times;  and l) The filament shall provide up to 100 nA emission current for high-current EBL applications, and be measured using an integrated Faraday cup. (Ammeter need not be included).  D. OPTION:  The following option is to be included and priced as a separate line item in the proposal.  1. A “manual” interface to allow direct manual control of focus, magnification, contrast, brightness, astigmatism and beam alignment. This should serve as an alternative to configuring these parameters through the GUI interface. E. INSTALLATION, TRAINING, DOCUMENTATION, WARRANTY AND SUPPORT:  Site inspection is required prior to installation. The contractor is required to install and verify the performance of the microscope at NIST, Boulder, CO. Training (for up to 4 people) shall be provided for NIST staff at NIST Boulder, CO. Full documentation, including operation and safety considerations shall be provided. In addition, the Contractor shall provide all documentation necessary to interface with the stage/imaging/external blanking/external x-y controls via external programs written by the end users.  The Contractor shall provide mechanical drawings for the specimen holders to allow fabrication of NIST’s own compatible specimen holders.  The warranty shall cover 1 year from the date of successful installation/verification at NIST. Successful installation is defined as a demonstration that meets the requirements of the Performance Specifications of Section C. 1. and Hardware and Software Specifications of Section C. 2.  at  NIST.  F. DELIVERY:   The Government’s desired delivery time is 120 days following contract award.  However, the Government will consider later delivery times, but offerors proposing delivery times longer than 120 days will be down rated.  G.  ACCEPTANCE:  Following successful installation, verification, and training, NIST will have three working weeks to accept all aspects of the system.  In the event that the system fails the tests performed at the Government site after installation, the parties will attempt by mutual agreement to negotiate an appropriate period of time for the Contractor to repair the failures.  The Contractor shall repair the failures on Government premises; however, the Government may unilaterally decide to return the equipment at no cost to the Government for repair at the Contractor’s facility or for rejection of the system.  SELECTION CRITERIA & INSTRUCTIONS: 1.  Meets the Technical Specifications (30%):  Proposals must demonstrate how each of the technical specifications are met by the proposed instrument.  2.  Past Performance (30%):  Proposals must contain accurate contact information for three customers who have purchased thermal field emission microscopes similar to the proposed SEM and integrated NPGS for EBL.  These references will be contacted to obtain opinions regarding system and service quality, especially with respect to EBL applications.  Other prior customers may also be contacted.  Questions to be asked of the references, but may not be limited to, are as follows:  a)  Did the equipment meet the customer’s specifications? b)  Was the equipment delivered on time? c)  Was the equipment installed correctly? d)  Was the documentation for the equipment complete and accurate? e)  How  skilled are the technicians in your service region? f)  Was the supplier responsive to queries once the equipment was installed? g)   How reliable/robust was the equipment?
h)   How quickly did the supplier remedy any failures of the equipment?  i)  Were the representatives of the supplier courteous and professional? j)   How would you characterize the consistency of fine EBL  features at the single chip/wafer  scale level?
k)  Do you have any problems with stage reproducibility or hysteresis in imaging parameters (i.e., probe current, magnification) which have impeded your EBL?  l)  How does the machine perform in a multi-user environment? Do you find the filament alignment stable over many weeks/months in such an environment?  3. Systematic Design Features (Software and Hardware) that Improve Reliability and Consistency in EBL Applications in a Multi-User Environment (15%):  Proposals should describe the user interface for controlling and using the SEM (this may take the form of a user manual, for instance), to give us an idea of the user interface. Proposals should also detail any design features which facilitate multiple user management and robustness. This may include special software for managing user settings and image files for instance, or particularly special failure mode (power, vacuum or user failure) features which protect the filament and prevent column contamination. Descriptions of these failure modes will be appreciated. Since this will be a multi-user facility with users at varying skill levels, ease of use will be a strong consideration. This includes both imaging applications and NPGS, as well as features relating to the export of data and networking.  The system will also be utilized for wafer-scale EBL.  Therefore, it is important that die-to-die parameters, such as stage reproducibility and backlash, are consistent.  Additionally, the focus stability over periods of a few hours will be very important. 4.  Warranty and Service Package (15%):  As noted in Paragraph E., proposals shall describe the length of the warranty provided and a description of the type of service to be provided during the warranty period.  Proposals that demonstrate the ability to provide prompt response to equipment failure will be scored higher.  Proposals with service representatives located in the continental United States will be scored higher.  In addition, offerors are requested to include a description (and cost) of their annual maintenance/service plan once the warranty period has expired. 5.  Delivery (10%):  Proposals should clearly specify delivery time.  Proposals that specify delivery dates longer than 120 days after contract award will be scored lower. 6. Price  Proposals will be considered on a best value basis.  Hence, Criteria 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 when combined, are more important than Criteria 6, Price.

<DESC>The Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN), USCG, intends to purchase on a non-competitive basis with The XYZS of GPS Incorporated, Dickerson, MD proprietary software developed for Coast Guard Differential Global Positioning Systems Reference Station Radio Technical Commission upgrades in accordance with the following Statement of work:
STATEMENT OF WORK, DGPS RTCM REFFERENCE STATION AND INTEGRITY MONITOR SOFTWARE UPGRADE
1 GENERAL.1.1 Background: The Coast Guard Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) broadcast network uses an Ashtech Z12R Marine Reference Station (RS) is used to detect Global Positioning System (GPS) signal errors and calculate corrections. And a Trimble 4000IM MSK Integrity Monitor (IM) to provide highprecision positioning and integrity monitoring functions. The RS generates required Radio Technical Commission for Maritime (RTCM) Special Committee (SC) 104 data message and modulates those
messages into a medium frequency (MF) signal that is fed to a radio frequency linear power amplifier (RFLPA). The IM generates required enabling data messages for the RS. A problem exists because the Ashtech Z12R and the Trimble 4000IM are no longer manufactured or available. The system functionality of both these equipments is still required by the Coast Guard DGPS System. A replacement method of calculating GPS errors, formulate the required RTCM SC-104 messages and generating a modulated signal to the RFLPA is needed. Basic functionality of both the RS and IM were developed and implemented in an executable software program. These programs were previously delivered under separate contracts by The XYZ’s of GPS to Coast Guard Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN). Upgrades to the original software are required in order to meet required new communications and internationally mandated message delivery. Additional levels of configuration change safeguards are also need to ensure critical changes are not made accidentally or without notification to the Nationwide Control Station. 1.2.4 Conflict of Interest: The contractor shall not employ any person who is an employee of the United States Government if that employment would, or would appear to, cause a conflict of interest. The contractor shall not employ on a part or full time basis an employee of the Coast Guard, uniformed or civilian, unless the Coast Guard has officially approved that employment. 1.3 Quality Control Program: The contractor shall have a written Quality Control Program that is acceptable to the Government and that assures that all work will conform to contract requirements. 1.4 Government Quality Assurance: The Government will evaluate the contractor’s performance under this contract using the task requirements and quality standards in this performance work statement. When an observed defect is other than minor, or when on-the-spot corrective action as to the cause cannot be taken, the Government will use a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), shown on Exhibit 1, to advise the contractor of the problem and require contractor response or corrective action. 1.4.1 Security Clearances: No special security clearances are required to perform the work under this contract. However, upon request, the contractor shall submit a list to the COTR showing the name and address of each employee (direct or sub-contracted) that will be working on the software development. 2 SCOPE OF WORK.2.1 The contractor shall provide an upgraded integrated version of the DGPS RTCM Reference Station and Integrity Monitor software programs delivered by The XYZ’s of GPS under previous contracts. The software programs run on a Windows based PC platform and provides the functional equivalent to the differential global positioning system (DGPS) integrity monitor or reference station (RS) being used in the present Coast Guard DGPS broadcast system. 2.2 The contractor shall deliver a single software program running on a Windows platform along with raw observable data inputs from a GPS receiver shall provide selectable functionality of either the DGPS
reference station or integrity monitor. 2.3 The upgraded software shall provide additional functionality and new RTCM DGPS messages required to be implemented under international standards and treaties. At minimum, the upgraded software shall include the ability to configure, schedule and broadcast of RTCM SC104 Type 60, 62 and 63 messages and complimentary RSIM messages.
2.4 Additional specific upgrades to the software program shall include:a. Ethernet communication that implements TC/IP format
b. Integrated single graphical user interface (GUI) with selectable functionality (either RS or IM functionality)
c. Automated software installation (installer) capability
d. Auxiliary data port implementation e. Logging and playback function for both GPS and MF receiver interface data f. Password protection function for program start, exit and parameter configuration g. Control Station notification, via RSIM message, of local site parameter configuration change. h. Single Windows icon for program start, stop and reset i. Auto-load of Default configuration values after program reset. j.

<SUBJECT>R -- DEVELOPMENT OF SEABIRD MITIGATION MEASURES FOR TRAWL VESSELS
<SOLNBR>WASC-4-1295
<RESPDATE>081604

<DESC>Combined synopsis/solicitation to assist with research, development, and pilot testing of seabird mitigation devices on trawl processors.  Work to be conducted for the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) in Seattle, WA.  Introduction and Issue Statement Fishing vessels using trawl gear target a variety of groundfish species throughout Alaskan waters.  These vessels range in vessel size, time and area of operation, and other aspects.  Trawls are deployed using 2 heavy cables that run from vessel winches, through blocks, and to the large trawl doors.  The net is attached to these trawl doors.  Many trawl vessels also deploy a small cable (Athird wire@) from the vessel to the trawl sonar net monitoring device.  
Observer coverage occurs on vessels 60 feet length-over-all and greater.  In this fleet the incidental take of seabirds have been documented during groundfish observer species composition sampling of the catch.  These birds are recovered from within the net.  Seabird mortality resulting from interactions with the trawl cables and the third wire has also been documented, but is not directly monitored by groundfish observers.  Therefore, the temporal and spatial distribution of seabird mortalities from these interactions is unknown.  This issue is pertinent because the National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) Alaska Region completed an Endangered Species Act Section 7 consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that resulted in a Biological Opinion with specific requirements of NOAA Fisheries. It is important to note that no incidental takes of short-tailed albatross have so far been recorded for trawl gear although sightings around trawl fishing vessels have been reported, and a likely to adversely affect determination was made.
One requirement of the Biological Opinion is to characterize the nature of short-tailed albatross interactions with trawl gear.  The Biological Opinion also has discretionary conservation measures.  These include characterizing seabird interactions with trawl vessels and developing mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate seabird mortalities.  NOAA Fisheries is currently exploring means to achieve these requirements and conservation measures.  An observer project is underway to develop improved methods of estimating total seabird mortality for various trawl industry sectors.  Unfortunately, the observer’s ability to monitor total seabird mortalities is compromised by other critical sampling needs.  Development and implementation of mitigation measures may be a better solution, which is the basis for this procurement.
Problem Resolution
Ultimately, the resolution to seabird interactions with trawl cables, third wires, and the trawl net is to develop effective mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate seabird interactions and mortalities.  NOAA Fisheries is currently engaged in efforts to characterize the nature of seabird interactions with trawl gear, and to develop estimates of seabird mortality by species.  Parallel to this effort, NOAA Fisheries wishes to support industry efforts to develop and test measures that would mitigate seabird interactions with this gear.  Funds are provided through this procurement action to support research and development into possible seabird/trawl mitigation measures.  
STATEMENT OF WORK
The Government will award one bid in this procurement action.  Award will be made to one of the two trawl fishery components that conduct at-sea processing of catch.  The development of mitigation measures is being targeted for at-sea catcher/processor facilities due to the sometimes large numbers of birds that attend these vessels.  The two groups for which bids will be entertained are:
Group 1.  Pollock Catcher/processors deploying pelagic trawl gear, vessels larger than 125 feet.  These vessels currently all deploy third wires as well.
Group 2.  Groundfish catcher/processors deploying non-pelagic gear, vessels larger than 125 feet.  These vessels may or may not use third wires, depending on the fishery they are engaged in.
We are focusing this procurement on these two components due to best available information on where the interactions rates may be highest.  NOAA Fisheries is working to improve its ability to monitor all sources of seabird mortality in Alaska groundfish trawl fisheries.  Future procurement actions such as this one may address means of adapting measures developed here for other vessel classes where appropriate.  
Funds available through this procurement are to assist with the research, development, and pilot testing of seabird mitigation devises which would reduce interactions with trawl cables and third wires.  The funds should be used to design several measures, complete fabrication where appropriate, and assess the use of the measures under typical commercial fishing activities. Assessment should address the use of the measures, including ensuring crew safety, ease of deployment, dependability, and durability.  Assessment should also provide preliminary information on how effectively the measures reduce seabird interactions with trawl gear.  This would best be achieved through direct monitoring of seabird interactions under an array of field conditions such as weather, sea state, and juxtaposition to the offal field.  Of particular importance is to note effectiveness during the set, normal towing procedure, vessels turns, gear issues such as short-wiring the trawl net, and haulback.
Seabird mortalities are also caused when birds interact with the trawl net.  This procurement action will focus on development of mitigation measures for trawl cables and the third wire.  However, procedures ultimately need to be developed for the net as well.  It may be possible to develop measures that address all these sources of mortality at the same time.  Inclusion of a possible mitigation measure that does so will be considered advantageous.
Objectives
1.  Conduct appropriate research, development, and assessment to provide advice to the industry and government on which seabird/trawl mitigation measures are likely to be the most effective in reducing seabird interactions with trawl cables and third wires. 
2.  Measures should address trawl cables and third wires, or just trawl cables, depending on the fishery component. 
3.  Explore several different measures in order to make a reliable assessment.
4.  Ensure that the recommendations for measures based on field assessment are representative of the class of vessels and has support from other vessel operators.
Project Description
The project includes a start up phase where a variety of ideas are discussed and several of those ideas are chosen for development and testing at sea.  Vessels would then need to be fitted out with appropriate gear and a protocol established for assessments which would meet the requirements noted above.  Field testing should be completed within several months of award, followed by report writing.  The primary final product of this project is to make recommendations on which seabird mitigation devices should be tested under a rigorous experimental design to be implemented at a later date.   
As a priority, funding will be supplied to entities that can engage several different vessels to complete field testing of a variety of mitigation measures.  Funds support the development of measures, field deployment, assessment, and reporting.  Several measures should be developed and tested within a vessel group noted above.    
Deliverables
The primary deliverables on this project are the recommendations on which measures were most effective for a given fishery component, and a report on research, development, and field assessment procedures and activities.

The report should include the following:
-	Design Phase: types of measures considered, and selection procedure used to decide which measure to test.
-	Fabrication: costs and vendors involved in the fabrication of measures.  If materials are readily available on the market, note so in the report.
-	Logistics: how each vessel involved in the study was fitted out for the measures, costs involved, and any problems that were encountered.  Note how problems were addressed.
-	Assessment – operational: Comment on how crew safety was ensured and note any risks posed by the measures, the ease with which the crew could deploy and retrieve the measures, and the overall durability and dependability of the measures
-	Assessment -- effectiveness: Methods used to evaluate seabird interaction rates with third wires and/or trawl cables as appropriate.  The report should include interaction rates with and without measures, and comments on effectiveness of the measures under the variables noted above (weather conditions, sea state, juxtaposition to offal field, etc.).
Schedule for Period of Performance
Design should begin shortly after award.  Simple designs should be deployed and tested as soon as possible whereas those that require more lead time can be tested later.  Field testing should incorporate different seasons where possible.  It is expected that within one year of award the design and assessment will be completed.  Analysis of the monitoring data should occur within two months of completion of field work.  A report will be due within 18 months of the award date and include the information noted above.  A specific schedule will be agreed on shortly after award.  Bids that propose to complete the project in less time while maintaining overall quality will be considered superior.  
Evaluation Factors
Proposals will be evaluated using the criteria noted below.  While preference will be provided to industry associations, owners of vessels who submit a superior proposal and whose vessel is reasonably representative of the particular fishery component will be considered.  Bidders can leverage their proposals by noting any design discussions already completed.  Where possible, government funds available will pay for the entire proposal. However, should these funds prove insufficient to fully support a superior proposal, a willingness by the vendor to provide partial or full matching funds will be considered important.  Funds will support as much as one bid as is possible.  
The technical aspect of proposals will primarily be evaluated on:
1.  Ability to provide several vessel=s to explore different mitigation measures.
2.  How representative the vessels are to one of the two fishery components noted above.
3.  Quality of overall proposal, including how the vendor plans to address the design, fabrication, and assessment stages.
4.  Ability to address the deliverables noted above.
5.  Qualifications of key personnel
6.  Previous work completed on developing seabird/trawl mitigation measures.
7.  Proposed timeline for project milestones and overall completion.
Projected costs will also be considered and evaluated.  If available government funds cannot fully support a proposal that is considered technically superior, the bidder will be contacted to determine whether cost-sharing is possible.  Cost-sharing, if necessary, will be considered before final decisions are made.  Bidders should note in their proposal whether they would entertain sharing costs on this work.
Recommendation for Bidders.
While government funds are available for this cooperative research, they may not be enough to pay for all aspects of the work.  Bidders should structure their proposal such that estimates are provided for each major phase of the project.  This procurement will cover as much of the cost as is possible, but final award may be based on the ability for the bidder to provide partial or matching funds.  Where possible, government funds will pay for the overall project.  Should a surplus exist after bid award, components of additional proposals may be considered. 
Although preference will be given to bids from industry associations, individual vessel owners are welcome to apply as well.  
Data Confidentiality.
At the time of this writing we have sought guidance from NOAA General Counsel on confidentiality of the raw data and data monitoring aspects.  It is expected that the final interaction rates and seabird mortalities will be reported, by species, in the final report and are as such public information.  The advice we seek is whether the raw data from monitoring activities are also public information should the vendor provide their own matching funds to address this component of the study.  That issue should be resolved prior to final negotiations and bid award.
