Must be able to accommodate samples composed of metals, oxides, nitrides, carbides, and carbon; or mixtures of these, in addition the following specific capabilities are required: Specifications: 1. A temperature range of room temperature to 1100„aC for testing/data acquisition, with programmable capability integrated for automated testing and data acquisition.  Actual sample temperature from furnace heating and energy input must be accurately measured for subsequent data analysis. 2. Equipment must allow for controlled atmosphere testing over the entire temperature range; including in vacuum (10-4 mbar minimum), inert, or oxidizing gases.  The vacuum/gas flow system must include a flow controller capable of 5-150 ml/min flow rates, and the necessary fittings for both vacuum and gas control.  The system must also include a vacuum pump.  The instrument must be capable of subsequent additions/modifications that will allow evaluation of materials in mixed gas atmospheres, such as air, or reactive gas compositions, such as Ar and low H2 concentrations. 3. The equipment must be capable of testing solid samples with sizes up to 25 mm in diameter and 5 mm in thickness, or square samples up to 10 mm by 10 mm. Holders that can accommodate samples with this range of geometries and sizes must be supplied with the equipment.  The instrument must be able to analyze samples that are solid (non-porous), or have up to 15% open porosity, and that are macroscopically heterogeneous. 4. For future work, the equipment must be capable of analyzing liquid or powder samples.  The instrument must also be able to accommodate a cooling system that will allow testing to -50oC, or less.  Sample holders for liquid and powder samples, and a cooling system for low temperature measurements must be currently available from the equipment manufacturer and be applicable to the equipment supplied under this procurement. 5. The instrument will measure sample thermal diffusivity utilizing laser ¡§flash¡¨ energy applied to the sample surface.  The energy source must be variable, allowing one to conduct analyses under the best conditions for a given material. 6. Laser ¡§flash¡¨ energy will be applied in such a way as to minimize energy input into the sample and associated sample damage.  Additional steps that can be taken to minimize sample damage will be considered a plus. 7. Because the instrument will include a laser as the energy source, safety interlocks must be supplied to prevent accidental leakage of laser energy. The equipment must meet all safety regulations associated with Class I Lasers. 8. The furnace must be isolated from the test samples to reduce the potential for instrument damage associated with the test atmosphere and/or the volatilization of material from test samples. 9. The equipment must be capable of evaluating materials according to ASTM E1461-01, Standard Test Method for Thermal Diffusivity of Solids by the Flash Method. 10. The equipment must be easy to calibrate and/or realign.  Changes in sample geometry, such as might be encountered when using an automatic sample changer, should not require system realignment by the user. 11. The equipment must be capable of evaluating the thermal diffusivity within the range of 0.001 to 10 cm2/s, and a thermal conductivity within the range of 0.1 to 2000 W m-1 K-1. 12. Software to control the equipment during testing, automatically acquire data during testing, and analyze the data to determine thermal diffusivity/conductivity  must be supplied by the equipment manufacturer. Software and the analytical equipment must continuously obtain and analyze data throughout a sample test run. The instrument must be capable of being controlled either manually or automatically (as programmed). 13. Software must calculate and allow the plotting of data in a number of modes, such as temperature versus time, and must calculate thermal conductivity and diffusivity. 14. Software must automatically correct for background/furnace/sample/sample holder issues within the system, and present options to the user as to how to evaluate the data that is generated.  Necessary corrections will include those for internal radiation, energy losses to the surroundings, and losses associated with the laser pulse energy. 15. Software supplied by the vendor will be loaded on a computer furnished by the purchaser.  The computer will run using Windows XP Pro, will have a PCI slot for an IEEE card, and have the following minimum specifications: Pentium 4/3.0 GHz, 1 GB RAM, 80 GB hard drive, DVD/CD-RW drive; 3.5"/1.44, MB floppy drive; and serial, parallel, USB, and Ethernet interfaces.

<DESC>The US Agency for International Development (USAID/Washington) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of its Mission in the Republic of Haiti in anticipation of a cost-reimbursement, level of effort contract to provide technical assistance to the new democratically-elected Government of Haiti.  To enhance Haitis capacity to undertake an ambitious development plan, the Government of Haiti (GOH) has requested US technical assistance in implementing significant reforms and modernizing state functions based on best practice models.  To assist the GOH in its effort, USAID intends to provide for the services of technical advisors to GOH Ministries and Offices (Ministries of Planning and External Cooperation, Commerce, Education, Agriculture, Justice, Public Works, Womens Affairs, Environment, Finance, the Investment Facilitation Center, the Prime Ministers Office, et al) under an Advisory and Assistance Services contract that will expand US support over the next three years (2007 / 2010), helping to strengthen GOH institutions and to ensure that the USG and other donor investments continue to achieve their full potential while instilling best practices in the institutions supported.  The successful contractor will work with the GOH Ministry of Plan and External Cooperation and USAID/Haiti to determine the placement of advisors based on a needs assessment or in response to a request for technical assistance.  This is a three-year activity, including one base year and two option years.
This requirement will be subject to full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply.  The authorized geographic code for this activity is 000 (U.S.) and the cooperating country.  Total estimated level of effort is anticipated to be 1,272 person months over a 3 year period (one base year and two option years).  USAID strongly encourages the participation of small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and women-owned small businesses in this activity as prime contractor or as subcontractor in accordance with FAR Part 19.

USAID anticipates the award of a single contract with a three year period of performance (including options).  In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium.  Requests for other copies of the RFP will be disregarded without notice to the requestor.  No phone requests will be accepted, no RFP will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed.           

Please do not contact USAID/Haiti directly.  All communication must be directed through USAID Washington.  The release of this notice in no way obligates USAID or the US Government to release an RFP or make an award of any type.

<DESC>The Department of Defense is initiating a spiral development effort to counter both the existing threat posed by Radio Controlled Improvised Electronic Devices (RC-IEDs) in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the long-term worldwide RC-IED threat.  The first spiral will develop a near-term technologically advanced solution to the RC-IED threats in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The first spiral will provide improved performance against advanced threats in a complex Electro Magnetic Environment, increased effectiveness ranges, and improved interoperability with other Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems. To execute the first spiral, the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) plans to release one or more draft RFPs in early first quarter of the Government’s Fiscal Year 2007, and a formal RFP in early/mid Fiscal Year 2007.  This RFP will result in a cost plus research and development  contract(s).  Contract award will be based on a best value analysis considering technical performance (system design, produciblity, supportability) and costs.   The NAVSEA intends to award one or more contracts for the design, development, fabrication, and test of a man portable (dismounted) CREW (3.1) system, in second quarter Fiscal Year 2007.  The ensuing contract(s) will be for the design and fabrication of up to ten systems, support testing evaluation of the systems, and provide engineering support to address problems and weakness identified during testing.  Successful offerors will have approximately 12 months to design, fabricate and test a dismounted system. The period of performance will include an initial design phase of approximately five months leading to a joint (contractor/government) test phase, and then followed by two additional design and test phases.  Five systems, including potential upgrades between test cycles, will be used to support the first two sets of tests.  Five additional systems will be used for the third and final test cycle. The Navy anticipates testing at various test facilities located on both the !  east and west coasts.  The successful offeror(s) will be responsible for the delivery of the appropriate number of systems to each of the two test facilities.    At the completion of this contract, the Navy anticipates conducting a limited competition between the successful offerers to select one or more sources to fabricate and deliver nominally 1,500 man portable (dismounted) CREW systems.  The production contract will also include shipping containers, training, associated data, spares, engineering support services, as well as, field and depot support.

<DESC>The Department of Anesthesiology, VA Medical Center, Durham, NC has a requirement for a monitor for the recording, measurement and display of depth brain function during anesthesia, a critical issue for patient care.  This type of monitor allows clinicians to wake the patient up faster and also to use less anesthesia with critically ill patients. Salient features of an acceptable depth of anesthesia monitor include: 1.	The use of a high resolution display to provide improved visual interpretation and confirmation or signal quality, revealing changes in brain activity not seen in low resolution screens. 2.	Four (4) channel bilateral frontal EEG monitoring for increased sensitivity to subtle regional changes for early warning system for impending changes in patient state. 3.	Reduced susceptibility to environmental noise, longer periods of artifact free EEG for increased availability of PSI (Patient State Index) accuracy and responsiveness. 4.	Displays the left and right frontal/pre-frontal EEG spectrum to show asymmetrical patterns to monitor changes in the patient's anesthetic state or differences in cerebral perfusion. 5.	Density Spectral Array (DSA) to facilitate interpretation of complex EEG patterns to improve clinician's ability to corroborate and understanding the PSI. Potential vendors must be able to provide this equipment and associated service and supplies for up to 5 years.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Department of Defense is initiating a spiral development effort to counter both the existing threat posed by Radio Controlled Improvised Electronic Devices (RC-IEDs) in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the long-term worldwide RC-IED threat.  The first spiral will develop a near-term technologically advanced solution to the RC-IED threats in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The first spiral will provide improved performance against advanced threats in a complex Electro Magnetic Environment, increased effectiveness ranges, and improved interoperability with other Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems. To execute the first spiral, the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) plans to release one or more draft RFPs in early first quarter of the Government’s Fiscal Year 2007, and a formal RFP in early/mid Fiscal Year 2007.  This RFP will result in a cost plus research and development  contract(s).  Contract award will be based on a best value analysis considering technical performance (system design, produciblity, supportability) and costs.   The NAVSEA intends to award one or more contracts for the design, development, fabrication, and test of a man portable (dismounted) CREW (3.1) system, in second quarter Fiscal Year 2007.  The ensuing contract(s) will be for the design and fabrication of up to ten systems, support testing evaluation of the systems, and provide engineering support to address problems and weakness identified during testing.  Successful offerors will have approximately 12 months to design, fabricate and test a dismounted system. The period of performance will include an initial design phase of approximately five months leading to a joint (contractor/government) test phase, and then followed by two additional design and test phases.  Five systems, including potential upgrades between test cycles, will be used to support the first two sets of tests.  Five additional systems will be used for the third and final test cycle. The Navy anticipates testing at various test facilities located on both the !  east and west coasts.  The successful offeror(s) will be responsible for the delivery of the appropriate number of systems to each of the two test facilities.    At the completion of this contract, the Navy anticipates conducting a limited competition between the successful offerers to select one or more sources to fabricate and deliver nominally 1,500 man portable (dismounted) CREW systems.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to change sentence #9 to read, "Successful offerors will have approximately 18 months to design, fabricate and test a vehicle mounted system." The Department of Defense is initiating a spiral development effort to counter both the existing threat posed by Radio Controlled Improvised Electronic Devices (RC-IEDs) in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the long-term worldwide RC-IED threat.  The first spiral will develop a near-term technologically advanced solution to the RC-IED threats in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The first spiral will provide improved performance against advanced threats in a complex Electro Magnetic Environment, increased effectiveness ranges, and improved interoperability with other Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems.  To execute the first spiral, the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) plans to release one or more draft RFPs in early first quarter of the Government’s Fiscal Year 2007, and a formal RFP in early/mid Fiscal Year 2007.  This RFP will result in a cost plus research and development  contract(s).  Contract award will be based on a best value analysis considering technical performance (system design, produciblity, supportability) and costs.   The NAVSEA intends to award one or more contracts for the design, development, fabrication, and test of a vehicle mounted (mounted) CREW (3.2) system, in second quarter Fiscal Year 2007.  The ensuing contract(s) will be for the design and fabrication of up to ten systems, support testing evaluation of the systems, and provide engineering support to address problems and weakness identified during testing.  Successful offerors will have approximately 18 months to design, fabricate and test a vehicle mounted system. The period of performance will include an initial design phase of approximately seven months leading to a joint (contractor/government) test phase, and then followed by two additional design and test phases.  Five systems, including potential upgrades between test cycles, will be used to support the first two sets of tests.  Five additional systems will be used for the third and final test cycle. The Navy anticipates testing at various test facilities located on bot!  h the east and west coasts.  The successful offeror(s) will be responsible for the delivery of the appropriate number of systems to each of the two test facilities.    At the completion of this contract, the Navy anticipates conducting a limited competition between the successful offerers to select one or more sources to fabricate and deliver nominally 1,500 vehicle mounted CREW systems.  The production contract will also include shipping containers, training, associated data, spares, engineering support services, as well as, field and depot support.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov  and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. POINT(S) OF CONTACT:       Contracting: J.D. Martin, NSWC Crane, Code 0564, e-mail LogR&D@navy.mil, 812-854-3723.       Technical: Ken Burt, NSWC CRANE, Code 609, email LogR&D@navy.mil , 812-854-2139. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) requires aggressive actions throughout the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy (DOE) to reduce the existing dependency on fossil fuels and to initiate the transition toward alternative fuels and alternative fuel power sources.  EPACT 2005 goals require the DOD to reduce existing oil consumption rates 20% between 2006 and 2015, increase the use of renewable energy sources more than 7.5% by 2013, and explore unconventional fuel alternatives (synfuels and biofuels) to initiate the transition towards a future hydrogen economy.  Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) are conducting research and development (R&D) and experimentation to advance the state of the art in manufacturing technologies and processes to increase the knowledge of and to help DOD meet EPACT 2005 goals and to complement the President’s hydrogen initiative.   DOD can contribute to the President’!  s initiative by being a ”first adopter” of hydrogen fuel cell technology when a strong case can be made that the technology benefits DOD militarily.  The funding allocated to this program is approximately $10 million.  Each program award is anticipated to be between $750,000 and $1.5 million excluding any proposed industry cost sharing.  The goal of this program is to conduct a DOD hydrogen (H2) fuel cell Materiel Handling Equipment (MHE) pilot program.   NSWC Crane is interested in receiving R&D proposals for scientific study and experimentation in the form of pilot projects directed toward advancing the state of the art or increasing knowledge or understanding in H2 powered MHE, Hydrogen vehicle fueling stations and the associated infrastructure. While this BAA will involve delivery of equipment and technology pilot testing for the purpose of data collection, the focus of this BAA is on the collection of operational data.  Successful proposals will include installation, maintenance and training associated with all equipment and hydrogen infrastructure needed to produce the required data for increasing DOD’s knowledge and understanding of the maturity of the technology. 1.	Conduct a DOD hydrogen (H2) fuel cell MHE pilot program –  1.1.	Background: DLA is DOD’s largest combat support agency, providing worldwide logistics support in both peacetime and wartime to the military services, civilian agencies and foreign countries. If America’s forces eat it, wear it, maintain equipment with it, or burn it as fuel…DLA probably provides it.  The Defense Distribution Center (DDC), a field organization of DLA, operates warehousing and cross-docking facilities for DOD.  The DDC’s 26 Distribution Depots, located throughout the United States and around the world, store items having 4 million different stock numbers in 327 million square feet of storage space and process more than 26 million transactions annually.   In total, DLA operates over 3,000 forklifts, of which approximately half are electric-powered.  DLA has identified select DOD target site locations with electric-powered forklifts to host pilot programs for this BAA. Proposers are expected to offer at a minimum a complete power unit that is equivalent in !  form, fit, and function and equal or superior in performance to the lead acid or nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery system currently used in these forklifts.  Other new and innovative approaches, including new forklifts designed for H2 fuel cell power, will be considered based on their contribution to the overall goals of this BAA.  This BAA will be amended as additional DOD site locations are selected to host a pilot program.  Site-specific information and requirements applicable to each new BAA amendment (Proposal Due Date, Site Visit Date, Site Location and Points of Contact, Operating Equipment Targeted for the Pilot Program, Equipment Duty Cycles, Host Site Procedures/Regulations/Utilities/Infrastructures, etc.) are provided at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/synopbaa.htm for the latest BAA amendment.  For informational purposes the initial BAA and previous BAA amendments are also posted at the link above. 1.2.	Goal Objectives:  The overarching objectives of this goal are to significantly increase the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) and Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRLs) associated with the fuel cell systems and components and to produce business case data for future retrofitting or replacement of the existing forklift fleet with H2 fuel cell powered forklifts. For definitions of TRLs see http://akss.dau.mil/dag/GuideBook/IG_c10.5.2.asp and for MRLs see https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=18231.  1.2.1.	Any award made at any phase must demonstrate a number of contributions to the maturation of H2 fuel cell or H2 infrastructure technology. The contractor should describe in detail how this project will advance the TRL and MRL of fuel cell system or hydrogen fueling station and infrastructure technology.   H2 Fuel cell technology includes fuel cell sub-systems and components (e.g., Membrane Exchange Assembly, power electronics, thermal management sub-system), and on-board H2 storage.  H2 infrastructure includes hydrogen delivery or onsite production, onsite storage, and dispensing technology or off-board H2 generation systems. Use of solid hydrogen storage medium is one specific area of interest for technology maturation efforts.  The improvements must be associated with the deployment and use schedule at the site of the proposed business data collection.  1.2.2.	The general nature of the improvements and the associated results obtained from the program will be documented and shared with selected industry and government personnel, subject to appropriate protections for proprietary information and other intellectual property.   1.2.3.	Business Case.  Additional sites may be included in the pilot program to generate business case data.  The business case will be built on data collected during the use of the H2-powered equipment and hydrogen infrastructure during daily operations by in-place government personnel.  The data collected should include sufficient detail to enable the following determinations: •	Fuel cell system continuous and peak power capabilities through pilot. •	Operational efficiency of the pilot systems (fuel cells) under various loading conditions and their degradation through the period of performance.  •	Overall lifecycle efficiency (well-to-tank) of pilot program hydrogen production, compression, and dispensing. •	Mean time between failure and specific pilot program equipment/infrastructure failure modes.  Downtime associated with failure mode. •	Safety incidents encountered through the pilot program and cause of incidents. •	Number hydrogen filling operations throughout the pilot.  •	Refueling rate (kg/min) and average fill time (sec) •	Purity of hydrogen generater/consumed throughout pilot program including specific description of impurities (type and concentrations). •	Total KWH energy produced by the pilot system •	Total KWH energy consumed by the pilot system •	Pilot fuel cell run time Business case data will be collected by contractor personnel or their representatives using, to the extent practical, automated capabilities provided by the company or companies supplying the fuel cells or the hydrogen fuel equipment for the pilot program (for example, using built-in test data collection capability for the H2 fuel cell).  This data will be provided to the procuring contract officer and the technical point of contact. This data will be used by the Government to decide the timing and extent of later phases of this project, and to what extent H2-powered MHE will be used in DDC operations.  The data will also be made available to other researchers and businesses, subject to appropriate protections for proprietary information and other intellectual property.  1.2.4.	This BAA solicits proposals for the site specific pilot program identified at the link provided in the Background section of this BAA.  It is expected that pilot program host site personnel will, after appropriate training, operate the MHE and contractor-provided equipment, including fueling from a local H2 storage facility using a hydrogen dispenser.  Proposals must address how the equipment will be provided and maintained and how the H2 will be provided, stored, and dispensed.  The contractor or contractor team will also need to obtain the necessary approvals and permits for all aspects of the infrastructure and associated applications.  Proposals must also provide a plan for operator training for equipment operation and refueling and for initial emergency response training for operators and local firefighting personnel related to proposal and infrastructure equipment. 1.2.5.	Planning, scheduling and delivery.  The contactor shall provide a detailed plan that includes pilot program equipment specifications and a delivery and operation schedule.  The contractor is responsible for all aspects of the pilot program infrastructure installation and operation including, but not limited to, site preparation, construction, permitting, commissioning and decommissioning (at end of project).  The contractor’s detailed schedule shall address all aspects of the pilot program.  The contractor shall clearly define the variable costs of hydrogen production in whichever form it is proposed.  The contractor shall identify any and all utilities and the daily and peak utility usage that the Pilot host will need to provide. 1.2.6.	Training. Proposals shall include a plan to provide operator training for the pilot program (equipment operation and refueling), emergency response training of the operators and local firefighting personnel as related to proposed equipment and support infrastructure. 1.2.7.	Operation and Maintenance. The proposal shall describe the maintenance and repair strategy for the pilot program throughout the full project period.  The proposal shall also include a description of any operational responsibilities of the site host.   1.2.8.	Subsequent phases of the effort will seek to establish a similar capability at additional DOD locations.  Additional pieces of H2-powered equipment and/or hydrogen infrastructure will be retrofitted or supplied. 1.2.9.	Generation (either on- or off-site) of the H2 from renewable, non-hydrocarbon based sources is a topic of interest and may be encouraged at specific sites.  DLA’s interest in on-site hydrogen generation will be addressed at a link provided in the Background section of this BAA.  Awards will be made in accordance with paragraph 2. below. 2.	 Proposals will be evaluated and selections will be made in phases over the period of time the BAA is open.  Proposals for specified sites will be due approximately 30 to 45 days after the issuance of a BAA Amendment identifying the specified site is posted. Specific dates will be identified in the link provided in the Background section of this BAA. Proposal selections are planned to be made during the period this BAA remains open at intervals of approximately 60 days as additional sites are identified and added by amendment to this BAA.  Offerors do not need to submit for previous sites to be considered for later sites.  Due to the fast pace of H2 technology development, a separate proposal and selection will be conducted for each subsequent location.  Any and all awards are subject to availability of funding.   3.	There will be a site visit for interested participants at each pilot program site. The site visit date, location, visitor request instructions and point of contact will be provided at the link provided in the Background section of this BAA. Each site visit will explain and clarify the objectives of this program and allow prospective offerors to view the site.  Government personnel will also respond to questions, but the information contained within this BAA or amendments to it take precedence over oral responses.  Any questions or clarifications that result in material changes to this BAA will be addressed by a written amendment to the BAA. The briefing materials used for the site visit, answers to the questions received and additional information (if required) will be posted on the site specific link approximately three to five working days after the site visit concludes. Interested firms are encouraged to attend.  Prospective offerors are requested to submit questions in writing prior to the technical point of contact via email prior to the site visit to allow for inclusion and discussion during the site visit.  Questions will be considered at any time prior to or during the site visit. Responses to some questions may be incorporated in an amendment to this BAA.  The Government will not be liable for expenses incurred by an offeror prior to contract award. Offerors are cautioned that remarks and explanations provided at the site visit shall not change the terms of this BAA unless the change(s) is amended in writing.    This notice constitutes a combined synopsis and Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR Part 6.102(d)(2). It is intended that this BAA be open until one year from its initial publication.  Proposals may be submitted by any non-governmental entity, including commercial firms, institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science or engineering (universities), or by consortia led by such concerns. NSWC Crane encourages participation by small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions. However, no part of this BAA is specifically reserved for these entities.  The following guidelines apply to all proposals. Typically each proposal may be funded incrementally for periods up to two years subject to the availability of appropriations.  Awards are expected to be between $750,000 and $1,500,000, with the size of each dependent upon the topic(s) (although NSWC Crane reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds). More than one effort may be funded for an individual topic area, and deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation.  Proposals for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and cannot be considered for funding.  Additionally, studies and theoretical concepts that do not lead to implementation are specifically excluded.  All criteria set forth in FAR Part 35.016 are applicable. Proposals should be submitted in two sections: full technical and cost.  Technical and cost sections should be submitted as separate files.  Each proposal is limited to 35 pages, including attachments and supplementary material.  Proposals will be evaluated by select Government representatives with non-Government (contractor) support used in an advisory role.  Contractor support companies used to advise the selection process are identified in the site specific link provided. Proposals will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: a.	Overall relevance and scientific and technical merits of the proposed effort, including the plan and schedule for implementing the pilot programs, completeness of the data collection and comparison, turnkey solutions, and expected improvements in H2 fuel cell or hydrogen fueling station and infrastructure capability at the pilot program’s completion; b.	Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed and the comprehensiveness of the technical data produced from the proposed effort are to be delivered with unrestricted rights;  c.	The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the organization or consortia with H2 implementations and the offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these critical to achieving the BAA objectives;  d.	The degree to which the proposed costs are reasonable and realistic and the quality, amount and extent of proposed cost share in the pilot programs. These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more important than price, but evaluated prices or costs must be reasonable and realistic to enable the Government to make an award. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. Any responsible business may submit a proposal.   Please send proposals via e-mail to LogR&D@navy.mil. Please refer to BAA number N00164-07-R-6685 in all correspondence and communications.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative solutions to address current and future Air Force net-centric interoperability requirements for maximizing the effectiveness of joint and combined military operations.

Semantic interoperability is becoming an increasingly important problem as user communities seek to interoperate within and between information spaces such as those that ride on the Global Information Grid (GIG). Semantic interoperability can be defined as the state where two (or more) systems (services, people) exchange data on the basis of an agreed vocabulary (ontology) that guarantees the same interpretation (semantics or meaning) of notions (concepts and their interrelationships) for the users of the interoperating systems. An ontology can be defined as a specific vocabulary and relationships between terms (words) used to describe certain aspects of reality, and a set of explicit assumptions regarding the intended meaning of the terms and relationships of the vocabulary. Ontologies and other knowledge representations are often viewed as allowing more complete and precise domain models, and the support and use of multiple, independently-developed knowledge representations is important to support multiple Communities of Interest (COIs), information producers, and information consumers. Semantic interoperability is considered an important foundation for increasingly effective information and knowledge management capabilities that accommodate cross-domain interoperability, information sharing, data fusion, situational awareness, and learning.  Each year of this solicitation is focused on a specific technical area: 

FY06:  Semantic Interoperability Studies.  Information transformation is the processing of elementary forms of information into rich interoperable decision making knowledge structures for human, enterprise, and machine learning and growth.  Semantic interoperability is considered an important foundation for increasingly effective information transformation capabilities that accommodate cross-domain information sharing and understanding.  This solicitation is seeking studies of the current state of the art in semantic interoperability technologies and how these technologies might best be applied to solving military interoperability problems, where current technologies fall short in this regard, and where research investments in this area are most prudent; particularly as they apply to developing scalable information services in support of multiple Communities of Interest (COIs) with multiple producers and consumers of information.  These studies will serve as input to the semantic interoperability research and development roadmap for future years (FY07, FY08, and FY09) under this BAA.  Current speculation for out-year research in semantic interoperability is as follows, but is not cast in stone and in most likelihood will change based on the studies being sought in FY06 and the results of future research and development conducted under the auspices of this solicitation and elsewhere.

FY07:  Ontological Interoperability.  Important to information transformation is gaining an understanding of the context of an information request (e.g., so that an information system can distinguish between whether the term "Predator" refers to an unmanned aerial vehicle, an animal, or a movie).  A context contains metadata relating to its meaning, properties (such as its source, quality, and precision), and organization.  Modeling and representing context can lead to several benefits in dealing with information overload by transforming information from its source context into the context of another user or system domain.  This in turn promotes interoperability at the semantic level.  Several approaches for representing context can be found in the literature.  One suggests bringing together metadata, user profiles, information modeling abstractions, and ontologies to construct a model of the application domain and user needs (Amit P. Sheth , "Changing Focus On Interoperability In Information Systems: From System, Syntax, Structure To Semantics", available at: http://lsdis.cs.uga.edu/library/download/S98-changing.pdf).  Another proposes emergent semantics where the meaning of information is extracted from the manner in which they are used (K. Aberer, T. Catarci, P. Cudr?-Mauroux, T. S. Dillon, S. Grimm, M.-S. Hacid, A. Illarramendi, M. Jarrar, V. Kashyap, M. Mecella, E. Mena, E. J. Neuhold, A. M. Ouksel, T. Risse, M. Scannapieco, F. Saltor, L. De Santis, S. Spaccapietra, S. Staab, R. Studer, O. De Troyer: "Emergent Semantics Systems", (invited paper) ICSNW 2004: 14-43. Available at: http://lsirpeople.epfl.ch/aberer/PAPERS/ICSNW-2.2004.pdf).    Many suggest using agent technology to gather context information and negotiate contexts (Mohamed Khedr and Ahmed Karmouch, "Negotiating Context Information in Context- Aware Systems", University of Ottawa, Available at: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/9670/29878/01363730.pdf?isnumber=&arnumber=1363730), as well as rule-based (Holger Wache, "Toward Rule-Based Context Transformation in Mediators", University of Bremen, Available at: http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/9658/http:zSzzSzwww.informatik.uni-bremen.dezSz~wachezSzPaperszSzefis-99-wache.pdf/wache99towards.pdf ), classification-based (Robert MacGregor, William Swartout, "Using a Description Classifier to Enhance Knowledge Representation," IEEE Expert: Intelligent Systems and Their Applications, vol. 06, no. 3, pp. 41-46, Jun., 1991, Available from: http://www.computer.org/portal/site/ieeecs/index.jsp), pattern-based (Steffen Lamparter, Marc Ehrig, and Christoph Tempich, "Knowledge Extraction from Classification Schemas", Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods (AIFB), University of Karlsruhe, Germany, Available at: http://www.aifb.unikarlsruhe.de/WBS/sla/paper/ODBASE04_Lamparter.pdf) and heuristics-based (Aris M. Ouksel, "In-Context Peer-to-Peer Information Filtering on the Web", The University of lllinois at Chicago, Dept. of Information and Decision Sciences, Available at: http://www.sigmod.org/record/issues/0309/C12.ouksel.pdf) methods to perform context characterization that would enable mediation between contexts.  The primary goal is not to develop new reasoning methods and techniques, but rather to apply known approaches from the fields of knowledge representation and reasoning to provide context modeling and transformation solutions.  In FY07, this solicitation seeks innovative approaches and technologies for achieving ontological mediation between different domains, vocabularies, information sources, and services.  Capabilities of particular interest include ontological interoperability technologies which contribute to our ability to: (a) provide a coordinated view across multiple data sources and knowledge representations, (b) mediate over mappings between multiple data sources and formats into a format conducive to knowledge-based analytical tools and intelligence analysts, (c) consolidate, disambiguate and normalize multi-source data into concrete knowledge representations, and (d) exchange and reuse inference-capable knowledge representations across differing contexts.

FY08:   Cross-domain Information Sharing and Systems Interoperability.     It is challenging for any large enterprise to achieve systems interoperability where there exists incompatible data, data models, services, and applications.  Even if interoperability is achieved, to whatever level, it can still be easily broken by the introduction of new technologies, new systems, or upgrades to existing systems.  Technologies are needed that make it easier to autonomously bridge the gaps between incompatible data, data models, services, and applications in order to make otherwise monolithic systems interoperate, particularly as enterprise components change over the course of time. Sharing information across domains is exasperated by systems interoperability problems, but other problems also come into play.  Effective information exchange across multiple user communities, disciplines, security enclaves, and organizational boundaries is often hampered by differences in the interpretation and use of information, as well as data ownership and governance issues. Information sharing capabilities that allow effective information exchange across a heterogeneous enterprise will only be achieved when information and its meaning can be made explicit, and be done so in a manner that does not infringe upon the stewards of that information.  Policy conflicts, often related to data ownership and governance issues, can hamper the efficiency and effectiveness of joint, coalition, and multi-agency operations.  Current technologies are insufficient to encode policies for semi-autonomous interpretation, negotiation, enactment, and enforcement.  Policy specification and enforcement tools and languages are needed to encode policies in a machine-readable form so that automated mechanisms can interpret, negotiate, enact, and enforce them.  In FY08, this solicitation seeks innovative approaches for the use of semantic technologies for achieving cross-domain information sharing and systems interoperability.

FY09:  Situational Awareness.     Maintaining situational awareness is difficult if the necessary collection assets cannot be rapidly deployed and connected.  Our inability to autonomously manage and network these assets must be overcome to achieve and maintain on-demand situational awareness.  Semantic service descriptions for the discovery, mediation, orchestration, and composition of networks of ad-hoc information assets could play an important role in servicing the need to have these networks put in place quickly to deliver the right information to those who need to be aware of it.  Even once delivered, correlating and integrating vast amounts intelligence data remains a hard problem.  Particularly as new sensor systems and platforms come on-line, it is difficult to effectively correlate, disambiguate, deconflict and combine sensor and human intelligence data into a common contextual model. Semantic modeling of the contextual information surrounding any given situation could be leveraged to improve the fusion of multi-source intelligence data into knowledge representations that gravitate toward an improved understanding of the situation and evolution of the associated contextual model.  These knowledge representations would need accompanying tools to be rendered for human comprehension.  Human interpretation of intelligence information is time consuming and sometimes error-prone.  If the collection of intelligence data can be effectively culled into knowledge representations that are encoded in a machine readable form, it might then be possible to make use of automated reasoning techniques to infer important logical conclusions from the data that might otherwise be overlooked by a human.  In FY09, this solicitation seeks innovative approaches for the use of semantic technologies for achieving situational awareness.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:  (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the innovation of the proposed technology, the technical approach, and the operational relevance of the problem solution to address current and future Air Force net-centric interoperability requirements, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates intellect, technical expertise, and domain knowledge, (3) Openness of Solution - The extent to which open architecture standards and technologies are leveraged, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA.  White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors.  Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals.  Examples of the administrative tasks performed include:  a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY.  Prior to award, the offeror will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

The initial notice advised of the Defense Commissary Agency, Design and Construction Division (DeCA/CIED) plans to implement a follow on Streamlined Construction Improvement Program (SCIP II) to optimize construction delivery of proposed projects by award of approximately ten (10) multiple-awards, firm, fixed priced, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts in two cetegories.  One category covers Larger-Valued National Contracts with estimated project values over $7.5 Million and another will cover Lower-Valued National contracts with estimated project values under $7.5 Million.  By this notice DeCA is advising prospective offerors of the following changes to the proposed solicitation: (1) The contracts will be awarded for a basic period of five (5) years with additional five (5) one-year options in lieu of a three (3) year basic period with two (2) one year options. (2) The total program maximum will not exceed $1 Billion in lieu of the initial program maximum of $498 Million (3) Concurrent with the changes to the program duration and total program maximum, at this time, the magnitude of the ten-year program consists of approximately 40 projects estimated over $7.5 Million and 90 projects estimated at below $7.5 Million.  This is in lieu of the previous five year program estimates of approximately 20 projects over $7.5 Million and 45 projects below $7.5 Million (4) The government has expanded its consideration of recent experience to include projects that have a documented project history with on-going construction for at least six months or more than 50% complete or projects that have been completed within the past 8 years in lieu of 5 years.

<DESC>Any questions regarding this solicitation should be address to: Scott Britt at scott.w.britt@usace.army.mil. The Seattle District Corps of Engineers has a competitive requirement for Rock Pillar Stabilization at Howard Hanson Dam.   Howard Hanson Dam (HHD) is located on the Green River in western Washington and is a 230-foot-high rock fill dam.  The existing outl et tunnel is 900 ft long, with a 19 ft semi-horseshoe shaped cross section, which is concrete lined.  A Fish Passage Facility is being constructed adjacent to the existing outlet tower and outlet tunnel.  To date, the excavation has progressed in elevation  from 1150 to 1074 feet and the front section of the Fish Passage Facility has been constructed and is being used as cofferdam to keep the excavation separated from the reservoir.   Project work includes drilling and grouting for foundation strengthening for the rock pillar that will be formed between the excavation and the outlet tunnel when excavation work progresses below elevation 1074 feet.  Grouting work that requires plugging o f drain holes in the existing outlet tunnel and an observer within the tunnel during all grouting activities will be performed during a 60 day work period, approximately 15 July 2007 to 15 September 2007, when the tunnel is typically not used to pass river  flows.  All foundation grouting work must be completed during this 60 day window so the tunnel can be used for reservoir management and flood control after this date.   Construct 22, 16-inch inclined drilled shafts approximately 70 feet long with structural steel W8X67 wide flange beams, centralizers, and other necessary appurtenances, and filled with concrete.  The drilled shafts are to be located within the rock pillar that will be formed between the excavation and the outlet tunnel when excavation work progresses below elevation 1074 feet.   Work also includes the decommissioning of 3 existing 12-inch diameter dewatering wells 250 to 350 feet deep at the Howard Hanson Dam Fish Passage Facility located near Palmer, Washington.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990 with a size standard of $31 Million.  Project is open to both large and small business.  Estimated magnitude of this construction project is between $500,000 and $1 Million.  Large bu sinesses with proposals exceeding $1 million must submit a subcontracting plan with goals for small, HUBZone, small disadvantaged, small woman-owned, and small veteran-owned concerns.  For the purposes of this procurement, a concern is considered a small b usiness if its annual average gross revenue, taken for the last 3 fiscal years, does not exceed $31 million.  For information concerning NAICS and SBA size standards, go to http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/.  Issue o f this solicitation will be via FedTeds: www.fedteds.gov, in electronic format only.  No disks or hard copy will be available.  Follow the registration procedures at this site and www.fedteds.gov to receive notification of solicitation/amendment posting. Persuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), the solicitation will be available for download no earlier than 15 days following the posting of this synopis; therefore the release date of the solicitation is no earlier than 7 February 2007.  Pursuant t o FAR, the response date (proposal due date) of the solicitation is no earlier than 30 days from the date of the solicitation release date; therefore, using 7 February 2007 as the approximate solicitation release date, the response date will be no earlier than 9 March 2007.  Note that all dates are approximate and are subject to change.  There is no technical information available until the issue of the solicitation via the Internet.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Quantum SDLT 320 Tape Drive.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. Digital Linear Tape (DLT) is one of several technologies developed to increase data transfer rates and storage capacities of computer tape drives. SDLT, an upgraded variant of DLT technology, makes it possible to store more than 100 GB on a single cartridge with data transfer speeds of up to 10 MB per second.  SDLT drives are currently deployed to posts.    The SDLT 160/320 is the second tape drive released in the SDLT family, offering a 45% increase in native storage capacity and performance as compared to the SDLT 110/220 GB tape drive. With its improvements in capacity and performance, the SDLT 160/320 GB tape drive is positioned as the fastest and highest capacity tape drive in the mid-range drive segment. Backward read compatible with DLT Type IV media, the SDLT 160/320 maintains the SDLT compatibility standards introduced on the SDLT 110/220 while adding read compatibility for media written in the DLT1 and DLT VS 40/80 format. SDLT 160/320 GB Tape Drive Customer benefits include: ·	160 GB per cartridge capacity requires fewer data cartridges for backups, reducing the customers total cost of ownership ·	57.6 GB/hour performance reduces the customers backup window by 33% or more as compared to other competitive technologies ·	Investment protection through backward-read compatibility with previously written DLT Type IV and SDLT media ·	Increased reliability and performance through technological advances in drive head and media design ·	Reduces dependence on spares inventory with a 24-hour exchange ·	SDLT technology roadmap offers future capacities beyond 1TB per cartridge<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the Quantum SDLT 320 GB Tape Drive because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ tape drives indicated that this is the only tape drive that meets the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested SDLT tape drives will be deployed at overseas posts which has established an environment comprised of equipment that is compatible with the Quantum SDLT 320 tape drive.  The continued use of the SDLT tape drive eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations. Most importantly, the Quantum SDLT 320 GB Drive is currently the only tape drive available that meets CA’s requirements. In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Quantum SDLT 320 Tape Drive without delay.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) for the purpose of obtaining information for the reception, ordering, acquiring and processing one-meter panchromatic and multispectral imagery.  Eagle Vision is the DoD's only deployable commercial ground station to directly receive and process imagery data from commercial, remote-sensing satellites and has a need for 1-meter panchromatic and multispectral imagery for use in the combat commander's mission planning/rehearsal and intelligence gathering systems.  Eagle Vision provides imagery products for military operations, disaster relief and homeland defense.  This RFI seeks information on capability to add a high-resolution optical remote sensing satellite to the Eagle Vision stations.  The satellite must be commercially available, unclassified, and available for direct downlink anywhere an Eagle Vision might be deployed world-wide. The satellite data must provide one-meter or better Ground Sample Distance (GSD) panchromatic imagery with swath width of at least 8 kilometers, and the original image without ground control must exhibit geo-location accuracy of 30 meters (Circular Error 90%) or better.  The satellite data must provide at least three-band multispectral imagery with ground sample distance of four meters or better, and geo-location accuracy of at least 40 meters (Circular Error 90%).   The interface to the satellite must be compatible with the Eagle Vision hardware and software architecture, with minimum changes to the existing fielded systems.  The satellite mission data reception, bit synchronization, and demodulation must be compatible with the fielded Eagle Vision communications subsystem.  The interface to the satellite must be an existing commercially available product, fielded in other active ground stations, and proven compatible with the high-resolution satellite. Interested parties should submit a concept paper, up to 10 pages in length, describing the satellite, interface, operational capability, concept of integration, benefits, risks and limitations, and budgetary cost projection.  Existing fielded implementations must be referenced.  Product brochures and vendor marketing material may be submitted in addition to the concept paper.  Responses are due no later than 13 February 2007, 2:00 PM EST.

<RESPDATE>020607
<ARCHDATE>04072007
<CONTACT>Lena C Andrews, 256-895-1072
<DESC>The US Army Engineering and Support Center in Huntsville, Alabama Center of Standardization (COS) intends to solicit and award design build - indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) and stand alone contracts for its Ranges program as part of M ILCON Transformation. The NAICS code for this program is 236220 Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The small business size standard is $31 million.  The targeted industry groups for this survey are traditional construction firms, architect -engineer firms, and contractors that provide non-traditional construction methods, such as Pre-Fabricated, Pre-Engineered, Panelized, Tilt-up, and Permanent Modular construction. The area of performance will be through out the continental United States. Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) - Description: a dedicated building for conducting individual and collective tactical training using combat vehicle simulators. CCTT is composed of computer-driven combat vehicle simulators and emulator workstations tha t operate interactively over local and wide area networks.  It supports training of armor, mechanized infantry, and cavalry units from platoon through battalion/squadron echelon, including the staff. Through computer workstations, CCTT adds logistics, arti llery, mortar, and aviation units to a synthetic battlefield depicting real-world terrain. Warfighters move, shoot, and communicate on this battlefield by operating with or riding inside combat vehicles and employing simulated weapon systems. The main part  of the building is a large, column-free open bay 118 ft by 243 ft to house 36 combat vehicle simulators as well as six additional simulators for staff elements, dismounted infantry, and observer-controllers. Other areas include an After-Action review (AAR ) room, system operator space, networking center, areas for spare parts storage, maintenance, admin, toilets, a break room, and mechanical and electrical rooms. Information systems cost is a major part of the overall project cost - at least 10 percent of t he facility cost is attributed to info systems. The electrical power and HVAC systems must also be sized to accommodate the loads from the simulators and networking equipment. The facility most comparable in the commercial world would be a data center. The  nominal gross building area is 47,366 sq ft, but may be adjusted slightly as long as functional requirements are met. Battle Command Training Center (BCTC) - Description: A dedicated building for conducting individual and collective battle staff training. Includes space for classrooms, rooms used as reconfigurable tactical operations centers (RTOCs), dedicated separate ro oms large enough to serve as work cells for complete staff elements of organizations that are battalion-sized or above (for example, S-1 through S-8), an after-action review (AAR) room, and administrative space. The RTOCs, work cells, and AAR room are prov ided with computer terminals interlinked to a central server that replicates tactical dispersion sites on a battlefield (including electronic battlefield imaging). The battle imaging is interactive and is displayed in multiple rooms within the building, wi th provisions for troop units outside the building to connect in and participate. Each of as many as 15 to 20 separate groups (both within the building and outside), with several functional areas (intelligence, operations, logistics, etc), is able to conne ct in and take actions that will influence the play of the simulation. Information systems cost is a major part of the overall project cost - at least 10 percent of the facility cost is attributed to info systems. A medium sized BCTC will require over 1000  LAN drops. This also has major implications for the electrical power and HVAC systems. The facility most comparable in the commercial world would be a data center. The facility can be used for staff training and for the conduct of command post exercises. Facilities in this category also may  require additional space to accommodate opposing force staff elements of similar organizational size.  The BCTC facilities come in three standard sizes: small (46,060 sq ft), medium (85,630 sq ft), and large (145,585 sq ft). Sizes are nominal and may be a djusted slightly as long as functional requirements are met. The magnitude of construction for most range projects is approximately $25 to $100 million. Contract awards are anticipated in the September 2007 timeframe with a one (1) year base award and four (4) option years for a total of five (5) years possible. Tas k order awards will be firm fixed-price.

If you are unable to perform in a whole region, what particular states are you interested in? 4. Would you be proposing on this project as a sole contractor, prime contractor with subcontractor(s), a joint venture, or a teaming arrangement? Identify, to the extent possible, your team members. If a teaming arrangement is planned, give details to the  extent practicable on how the team likely will be composed. See FAR subpart 9.6 for Government policy on teaming arrangements. 5.

<DESC>This is a market survey to identify potential vendors that can replace existing inventory of  infusion pumps across  VISN 21 facilities which are VAMC, San Francisco, CA; VA Palo Alto Health Care System; VA Central California Health Care System, VA Northern California Health Care System, VA Pacific Islands Health Care System and VA Sierra Nevada Health Care System.   Our evaluation will focus on general use infusion pumps, although vendors are requested to submit information pertaining to PCA and epidural pumps as well, if those products are part of the vendor's inventory.  Our evaluation will be primarily focused on general use pumps and the initial pricing proposals should be structured as a set based agreement with a specified utilization across the term of the agreement.  Also, the existing inventory of Gemini infusion pumps will be traded in to offset overall agreement costs. The product offering must be equipped with dose error reduction (DER) capabilities that has FDA approval and is currently deployed.  Please submit separate pricing proposals for the DER functionality to include additional pump costs, server and deployment costs.  The pricing for these components should be developed in two ways:  additive cost to the set based agreement and as a unique capital cost.  As part of the evaluation process, each vendor will be asked to respond to this RFI with a preliminary pricing proposal and to complete the evaluation questionnaire and pre-procurement assessment documents.  Venders meeting the response deadline and that supplied complete documentation meeting our specifications will be invited to participate in on-site demonstration sessions where proposed equipment will be brought in for hands on evaluation by clinical and technical staff.  Preferred vendors will be asked to then submit best and final proposals along with answers to follow-up questions generated during the evaluation process.  The North American industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 423450.  All interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) in order to receive an award. This evaluation process will be managed by VISN 21 with the specific intent of accommodating the existing needs of our network facilities.  However, the agreement will be structured in a Blanket Purchasing Agreement (BPA) format such that other VISNs may elect to utilize our agreement without going through a separate solicitation process.  The vendor should provide a tiered pricing or rebate proposal in the event additional VISNs choose to benefit from this agreement.  Interest firms must provide the following information via email at karen.smith3@va.gov: Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Phone Number, preliminary pricing proposal, evaluation questionnaire and pre-procurement assessment documents. Subject line of email should state VA-261-07-RI-0030 Infusion Pumps.  Please provide your response no later than February 7, 2007 @ 3:30 pm PST.

<DESC>Army Contracting Agency The Americas: US Army South, 1-228th Aviation, Soto Cono Air Base, Honduras has an immediate requirement for UH-60 and CH-47 Aircraft Painting this sources sought is requesting intersted vendors to announce their interest and provide information listed below in order to  establish a work statement resulting in a follow on solicitation to conduct the work at Soto Cono Air Base: 1-228th has 2xUH60A, 12xUH60L and 4xCH47 that require painting. This Battalion operates within a Severe Corrosion Zone. The aircraft are subject to salt water and volcanic activity on a regular basis. It is the intent of the Battalion to get all 14xUH60 an d 4xCH47 aircraft stripped, primed and repainted to bring them to TM 55-1500-345-23 standards.  Requested Minimum Work: The contract should be able to strip the aircrafts painted outer surfaces only a few layers into the OD Green CARC, just enough to eliminate rough and unevenly painted areas and do the same for the inner cargo area and pilots areas. Request the contract be able to re prime areas that require it, and then repaint IAW TM-55-1500-345-23 for 10xUH60 Cargo Helicopters, and 4xUH60 Medevac, and 4xCH47 paint schemes. Facilities available: The 1-228th has a large aircraft maintenance clamshell. This shell is open to the environment on both ends and is approximately 100x 80. There are no paint booth facilities available, nor any ventilation systems.  Lodging and meal facilities are available on base at a cost. Off base motel facilities are very limited and not the preferred way to lodge contractors due to facilities and security. Vehicle support if requested can be arranged, however, the base of Soto Cano is small enough that the preferred method of transportation is walking.

<SUBJECT>A -- Long-Term Bridge Performance Program
<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is initiating the Long-Term Bridge Performance (LTBP) program authorized in SAFETEA-LU.  The LTBP program is a long-term research effort designed to collect, document, and make available high-quality quantitative performance data on a representative sample of bridges.  The objective of the program is to increase our knowledge of bridge performance and degradation, develop better design methods and performance predictive models, and support advanced decision-making tools for bridge management.

Through a competitive process, the FHWA plans to select a Lead Technical Support Contractor (LTSC), (or Team) to manage the program, and ensure the accomplishment of the work and objectives. The overall effort involves the development of a statistical bridge sampling plan, identification of data types to be collected, collection of data, development of a database and cyber infrastructure, and development and implementation of data mining and decision-making tools to serve the bridge community. 

FHWA Office of Acquisition Management is asking the bridge community and other appropriate stakeholders to provide input which may be helpful in drafting the Request for Proposal (RFP). Such input could include:

1) suggested contract types (or hybrids)
2) specific line items (CLINs)
3) suggested evaluation criteria [what should we be looking for...what is important in picking the right contractor(s)]
4) what types of technical information and plans should we be asking for now, and what types could, or need to be, determined after award
5) single Prime versus Teaming arrangement
6) other input as appropriate.

FHWA is NOT looking for organizational statements of capability. Since we are only interested in advice regarding the content of the forthcoming RFP, please keep your comments on topic.

This synopsis is not an RFP, and the Government will not reimburse any costs associated with responding to the information portion of this notice. The Government intends to issue a formal RFP at a later date. To have an impact on the RFP, your earliest response is appreciated as we are currently drafting the forthcoming RFP.

Please send your comments to:  Benjamin.Zaslow@dot.gov  with a cc to Robin.Hobbs@dot.gov. Use LTBP RFP Comments in the Subject line.

    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.

    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.

USAID is seeking registered professional engineers and/or licensed A-E firms that are either individual firms, partnerships, corporations, associations, or other legal entities permitted by law to practice the professions of architecture or engineering.  USAID encourages subcontracting opportunities with eligible U.S. or Non-U.S. organizations under Geographic Code 935 countries.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 Engineering Services.

The selection of the Architect-Engineer (A-E) firm(s) will be conducted in accordance with the Brooks Act as implemented by FAR Subpart 36.6. 

As defined in 40 U.S.C. 1102, Architectural and engineering services are:
 (1) Professional services of an architectural or engineering nature, as defined by State law, if applicable, that are required to be performed or approved by a person licensed, registered, or certified to provide those services; 
(2) Professional services of an architectural or engineering nature performed by contract that are associated with research, planning, development, design, construction, alteration, or repair of real property; and 
(3) Those other professional services of an architectural or engineering nature, or incidental services, that members of the architectural and engineering professions (and individuals in their employ) may logically or justifiably perform, including studies, investigations, surveying and mapping, tests, evaluations, consultations, comprehensive planning, program management, conceptual designs, plans and specifications, value engineering, construction phase services, soils engineering, drawing reviews, preparation of operating and maintenance manuals, and other related services. 

TYPE OF CONTRACT/PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE/ESTIMATED COST:
USAID intends to award a five-year multiple-award Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) with an aggregate ceiling price up to $500 million.  The aggregate ceiling covers all contracts awarded under this solicitation.  USAID anticipates awarding approximately three (3) IQC awards.  The Contracting officer reserves the right to award more or fewer than three awards.  The maximum aggregate dollar value of all task orders awarded to all contractors cannot exceed $500 million.  The ceiling will not be subdivided amongst the contractors.

The A-E firms who are selected to participate in the discussions will be given specific guidance and instructions at the appropriate time and will be given approximately 3 weeks to prepare their response regarding concepts relevant to the scope of work.  Any information submitted and/or received during the discussion process may be used as justification for the final ranking of the firms recommended to the Selecting Official to make the final selection, in order of preference, to determine apparent successful offeror(s) prior to cost discussions.

DOC does not anticipate that a new requirement will be synopsized.
