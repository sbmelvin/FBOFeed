<DESC>This a notice that CBU-HR intends to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) to suppliers who can satisfy the Government's requirements as stated below.  Contractors shall provide Modern Burner Units (MBU) 'JP8 diesel field stoves' and related supporting equipment that will enable a cook to operate the burner in various field-cooking scenarios.  Contractors will need to submit (4) four Product Demonstration Models (PDM) 'burners', supporting equipment, and operator's instructions as specified in the solicitation.  The MBU is the standard/current general-purpose heat source for food preparation in the field for the U.S. Army.  The Army Field Feeding System (AFFS) currently uses the MBU as the heat source for their: Mobile Kitchen Trailers, Modular Field Kitchens, Food Sanitation Centers, Containerized Kitchens, and Kitchens, Company Level, Field Feeding-Enhanced.  The burner provides the heat to perform basic AFFS functions of roasting, grilling, broiling, frying and heating (of water) required to prepare hot A, B, and T-rations (heat and serve rations) as well as perform field sanitation.  The contractor who is source-selected for award; will have to supply the contract data requirements (manuals, reports, parts lists, etc) as defined in the solicitation.
     This solicitation will complete the Army's initial requirement for the MBU.  The five basic components: Burner unit, power converter, battery module, fuel can adapter, and cable set, must be interchangeable (same fit, function, and interface) with the currently fielded MBU system components.
     The MBU produces heat by the combustion of JP-8 diesel fuel.  It has the ability to refuel from a remote fuel source.  The MBU offers: light in place electric ignition; smoke free start-up and operation, low power draw, and immediate on/off capability.  While meeting all of the Army?s footprint requirements, it must also comply with all the Army's MANPRINT requirements as well.  The MBU has a heat output range of 50K BTU/HR adjustable to less than 15K BTU/HR.  The MBU is operated in environmental conditions hot (120F) through basic (-25F).  The unit will be ignited and operated inside tents, soft sided trailers, and soft sided expandable shelters and as such, clean ignition, combustion, and shut downs are extremely important.  The unit will be exposed to, but will not be operated in the rain.  Cleaning of the unit will be accomplished by wiping it down with a wet soapy cloth, and other means indicated in the operator's manual.  The burner unit shall be transported on ground vehicles as unrestrained cargo.  The operator without any special tools will perform all maintenance required.  The MBU must be made to all the requirements as stated in the Performance Purchase Descriptions that will be issued with the solicitation.
     The contractor shall submit four (4) PDM(s), as part of its proposal.  Models will be submitted at no expense to the government.  If not destroyed by testing or retained by the government as a manufacturing standard, the models will be returned at the offeror's request and expense.  PDM(s) will become government property unless return is requested within 30 days after date of award.  Models will be tested or evaluated to determine compliance with all characteristics in the specification.  Subject solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis.  Solicitation SP0500-02-R-0004 is expected to be issued on or about 28 FEB 2002.

<DESC>17. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) requests information from companies interested in bidding on a follow-on contract for the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) program.  NSIPS is a Personnel and Pay system for Department of Navy (DoN) Active Duty and Reserve service members worldwide and provides personnel and pay support throughout the life cycle of a Service member's career.  NSIPS provides support during peacetime and war, through mobilization and demobilization, deployment and redeployment.  This follow-on effort will transition the NSIPS Client Server Database to a centralized database, web-enable it, and add an Electronic Service Record (ESR) capability.  NSIPS will continue to accommodate changes to both policy requirements and processes within the Navy personnel and pay functional arena for the life of the system.  The centralization, web-enablement, ESR and future enhancement efforts will be accomplished within the Navy Task Force Web (TFW) framework and must be developed in accordance with Navy-Marine Corps Intranet development guidelines. The security architecture must be implemented using Department of Defense DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology. NSIPS is based on the People Soft Release 8 version software and Oracle Release 8. Currently it is expected that Acquisition Information System (AIS) Category I and II personnel will be US citizens.  Such positions will be identified in future releases of information. This will be a full and open competition between all interested parties. The Government intends to award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract for a base year with 4 option years.  The estimated value over 5 yrs is approximately $60M. Interested parties may schedule face-to-face meetings between now and 14 March 2002 with the NSIPS Program Office, IAW FAR 15.201. Face-to-face meetings must be scheduled in advance. Call Kim DeBois Sousa at 619 524-7186 or Dennis Pigg at 504-697-5305 to schedule a time to meet with the Government team.  For more information on scheduling meetings and any resulting procurement package, review and monitor the SPAWAR Business Opportunities webpage at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  All information on this procurement will be posted on the Business Opportunities webpage.  The FAR is available at http://web2.deskbook.osd.mil/default.asp.

<DESC>NUWC Division Newport intends to place a Sole Source (SAP) procurement to Mercer Engineering Research Center in Warner Robins, GA for two Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) System Analysis Models (ASAMs) to support testing and integration of the ADF with other systems on 688 Class Submarine. Mercer Engineering Research Center is the only known source with the history for providing System Analysis Modules.  The ASAM must use the current High Probability of Intercept (HPI) System Analysis Model (HSAM) as its development base.  Since the original development was conducted as a prototype effort there is only limited documentation available on the HSAM system.  Documentation that does exist does not provide the needed details to support the design and production of the ASAM.  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form. Instead, they may be accessed at our web site http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/.  We also provide electronic access in our Bid Room.

<DESC>The Electronic Systems Center intends to issue a task order against a GSA Federal Supply Schedule on a Sole Source basis for the Joint STARS Joint Test Force (JTF) flight test and evaluation requirements, to be performed at the Joint Test Facility located at Melbourne, FL.  The proposed task order will provide non-personal services to provide systems engineering and technical assistance for the JTF at Melbourne, FL and its related activities at Hanscom AFB, MA, and Robins AFB, GA in the conduct of flight test engineering, test engineering, test management, test mission planning, test operations, computer analyses, computer modeling, prototyping, and supporting tasks in support of the Joint STARS program. The Government intends to issue the task order under the terms of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) established under ESC's Information Technology Services Program II (ITSP II) with Titan Systems Corp., 700 Technology Park Dr., Billerica, MA, 01821. Titan is currently the incumbent contractor.  Statutory authority is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source."  It is considered that only Titan has the requisite technical and Joint STARS expertise to satisfy Joint STARS Joint Test Force (JTF) flight test and evaluation requirements.  The anticipated period of performance is five (5) years.  A Task Order/Delivery Order Ombudsman has been appointed to specifically address concerns related to ITSP II.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  Issues or problems that cannot be resolved satisfactorily at the Program Manager and/or Contracting Officer level may be brought to the Ombudsman.  When approached with an issue or query, the Ombudsman will independently assess the situation and provide a response or initiate a resolution, and when requested, will maintain confidentiality as to the source of the inquiry. The ITSP II Ombudsman at ESC is Mr. John Nunziato, Acting Director of Contracting.  He may be contacted at (781) 377-2201.  Please direct any questions regarding this action to Lt Andrew Gillman, ESC/JSK, at (781) 377-6131.   See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being issued as a request for quotations(RFQ2031).  This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 01-03.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This is not a small business set-aside.  The North American Industry Classification System(NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541990 and the small business size standard is $5 million.		
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has a requirement for Genome Scanning Services to include five different genome scan projects.  The five genome scans are as follows:  (1) Genome scan for (BALB/c.FcyRII-/- x C57BL/6. FcyRII-/-) F2 to C57BL/6.FcyRII  backcross line.  Strain name is R2B6.rbb1.  (2) Genome scan for (BALB/c. FcyRII-/-  x C57BL/6. FcyRII-/-) F2 to C57BL/6.FcgRII-/-backcross line.  Strain name is R2B6.sbb1.  (3) Genome scan for 129sv;C57BL/6J loxP-flanked SHIP to C57BL/6J loxP-flanked SHIP backcross line.  Strained name is SHIP34.  (4) Genome Scan for 129sv;C57BL/6J KO SHIP to C57BL/6J KO SHIP backcross line.  Strain name is B6.SHIPnull.  (5) Genome scan for C57BL/6J.yaa to BALB/cJ backcross line.  Strain name is BALB/cJ.yaa.  Five different mouse strains are being generated and require full genome scanning genotyping of a maximum of six generations with 16 mice per generation.  Two congenic strains containing susceptibility loci defined by the genetic analysis of an F2 cross between BALB/c.FcyRII-/- and C57BL/6.FcyRII-/-.  Strain C57BL/6 rbb1 contains the distal portion of chromosome 9 from BALB/c in C57BL/6.FcyRII-/-.  Strain C57BL/6J sbb2 contains the distal portion of chromosome 12 from BALB/c in C57BL/6.FcyRII-/-.  One congenic strain that contains y-chromosome-linked autoimmune accelerator gene from SB Mice in otherwise BALB/c background.   This strain named BALB/c.yaa will be used for a genetic and phenotypic characterization of the yaa mutation.  Two strains (C57BL/6J. SHIP34 and C57BL/6J. SHIPnull) contain a mutation in the gene for the inositol phosphatase SHIP.  The genetic background of these two strains are to be from C57BL/6J mice so that the SHIP mice can be compared and crossed to other autoimmune prone strains such as C57BL/6. FcyRII-/-, C57BL/6J. yaa and C57BL/6J. lpr.The different mouse strains are being bred to obtain new lines of mice that can be used in a genetic analysis to discover new candidate genes for autoimmune disease.  This breeding requires the selection of the male breeders with the best genome-wide genotype in each one of six generations of breeding.  This selection is performed by the scanning of the entire mouse genome using genetic markers (SSLP) localized in all 20 chromosomes and spaced by a maximum of 15cM.  The Genome Scanning Service shall include extracting mouse tail DNA, selecting of  SSLP markers,  processing data into a file easy to read by a personal computer and data analysis.  The contractor that will perform this service shall have the capabilities and expertise in mouse genome scanning, mouse DNA preparation, PCR reactions, Fluorecent fragment detection, genotyping data acquisition, processing and analytical capabilities to decide the course of action for the genotyping of following generations.  The contractor shall be able to deliver within 2 weeks after receipt of mouse tail specimens up to 3,000 genotyping reactions.  Including analyze the genotyping data, score the percentage of the donor strain genome present in the genotyped mice.    
FOB Point shall be Destination, Inside delivery, TwinBrook II Facility Room 202D, Parklawn Drive, Rockville  Md. 20852.  This will be a fixed-price contract.

Describe how quantifiable, non-cash economic factors for households have changed from 1965 to the present in relation to the greater availability of cash jobs.   Task 3: The Role of the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC), Ukpeagvik Inupiat Corporation (UIC) and Other Village For-profit Corporations in the North Slope Economy: The Contractor shall depict the role of ASRC, UIC and other village for-profit corporations in the North Slope economy from the year of their establishment to the most recent year data are available.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Light Imaging Facility (LIF) plans to procure state-of-the-art light imaging equipment from Carl Zeiss, Inc., One Zeiss Drive, Thomwood, New York 10594.  The LIF has a growing number of scientists in the Division on Intramural Research (DIR) that require access to a laser scanning confocal microscope to collect optical sections of fluorescent specimens.  Common applications include: visualizing immunofluorescence in tissue culture cells, brain slices, and intact organisms; reconstructing the three dimensional structure of thick specimens; capturing time lapse movies of cells expressing proteins tagged with variants of the Green Fluorescent Protein; and monitoring cellular physiology with fluorescent indicator dyes.  A common problem in laser scanning confocal microscopy is difficulty in distinguishing the signals of fluorophores with overlapping excitation and emission spectra.  An innovative device for overcoming this problem was designed and patented by Carl Zeiss, Inc. The device, called a "Meta-Detector", is exclusively for use with the Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope.  The Meta-Detector consists of an optical grating and 32-channel detector. To collect an image, the confocal microscope is used to scan the specimen with a laser in a raster-pattern. The laser excites fluorophores causing them to emit fluorescence. The optical grating separates and directs the emission wavelengths to different channels of the Meta-Detector. The fluorescence emission spectrum at each pixel in the image is recorded. Software for deconvolving the spectra so as to be able to identify the fluorophores present at each point in the image is included with the system.  This technology makes it possible to discriminate the fluorescence signals produced by fluorophores with overlapping excitation and emission spectra, such as the yellow-green fluorophores: FITC, GFP and YFP.  In particular, scientists in several laboratories need access to a microscope that can discriminate between variants of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) in order to localize GFP-fusion proteins in living cells.  The best GFP variants for studies in living cells are YFP, GFP and DsRed.  These are difficult to discriminate using conventional fluorescence filters but can be discriminated with the Zeiss Meta-Detector.  The system will have two conventional fluoroescence detectors with independent detector pinholes for circumstances in which the sensitivity of the conventional detectors is essential.  The monitor diode is needed to monitor laser output and the transmitted light detector is required for imaging with differential intererence 
In addition, the system will include the optical elements needed to attach an existing UV laser
(Coherent Enterprise), which will allow detection of UV fluorophores.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, on February 25, 2002.  For further information please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent (301)-402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Family of Interim Armored Vehicles (IAV) Operational Requirements Document (ORD) includes a requirement for a high explosive cartridge for the Mobile Gun System (MGS) of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) to defeat a variety of targets by direct fire in support of dismounted infantry operations.  Specifically, the IAV ORD requires the MGS to provide direct, supporting firs to assault infantry in order to destroy hardened enemy bunkers, machine gun, and sniper positions.  To accomplish this, the MGS primary armament must defeat a standard infantry bunker and create an opening in a double reinforced concrete wall, through which infantry can pass.  The HE cartridge will provide the material solution to meet the ORD requirements.   A Production and Deployment effort of a non-developmental item (NDI) is planned for the tactical and TP-T cartridges.  The solicitation and contract award will  be competed on a limited basis, restricting the manufacturing of the training cartridge in Phase II to the U.S/Canadian domestic base.  The components will not be restricted for the training rounds.  The components and the manufacturing of the end item for the tactical cartridge will not be limited to the U.S./Canadian domestic base.  The solicitation and contract award will consist of two (2) phases, which will result in one contract for both items in production.   Phase I will be for the delivery of hardware samples for the tactical and trainer cartridges.  The purpose of the samples will assist in the determination of the best performing cartridges to meet the need of the MGS requirements.  The performance of the samples will be used in the selection criteria for the Phase II effort.   NOTE:  Additional details for this requirement can be found at Draft Solicitation, DAAE30-02-R-0606 The contractor may manufacture both the tactical and training cartridges outside the U.S./Canadian domestic base for the Phase I hardware.  Phase I may be awarded to either one or multiple contractors.  A Statement of Work (SOW) will be provided which will include the item description.  Phase I will consist of 40 each tactical rounds and 35 each TP-T rounds, for each contract awarded.

<CONTACT>Richard Rogus, Contracting Officer, contact Contract Specialist, rogus@netl.doe.gov;Donna Jaskolka, Contract Specialist, contact by e-mail only, jaskolka@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>ACTION: Notice of Availability of a Financial Assistance Solicitation SUMMARY:  Notice is hereby given of the intent to issue Financial Assistance Solicitation No. DE-PS26-02NT41450 entitled MINING INDUSTRY OF THE FUTURE/MINERAL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES.  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Industrial Technologies (OIT) in collaboration with the National Mining Association (NMA) is seeking industry- led  proposals for cost-shared research and development of technologies which will reduce energy consumption, enhance economic competitiveness and reduce environmental impacts of the domestic mining industry.  The research is to address research priorities identified by the Mining Industry of the Future Mineral Processing Technology Roadmap (the Roadmap can be accessed on the INTERNET at: http://www.oit.doe.gov/mining/pdfs/mptroadmap.pdf ).  In particular, the roadmap identifies three (3) areas of mineral processing technology where the most impact and the greatest progress towards the mining vision goals can be expected: 1)  Mineral Preparation - typical processes include communition, makedown, classification, and, to some extent, blasting and drilling; 2) Physical Separations - typical processes include flotation, dewatering, thickening or settling, filtering, drying, flocculation, screening, magnetic separation, classification and washing; and 3)  Chemical Separations - typical processes include pelletizing or briquetting, smelting, refining, leaching, solvent extraction, bioleaching and electrowinning. The DOE Office of Industrial Technologies does not fund product development R&D.  Applications submitted in response to this solicitation will only be funded if the proposed research and development addresses improving the energy efficiency of mineral processing technologies.  Applications for literature reviews only will not be considered.  Additionally, applications offering emissions or waste disposal, remediation, or treatment as a primary focus are not eligible for funding under this solicitation.  This limitation does not include applications that target materials recycling or by-product utilization as their primary focus. DATES: The solicitation will be available on the "Industry Interactive Procurement System" (IIPS) webpage at http://e-center.doe.gov on or about February 27, 2002.  It is further anticipated that applications will be due approximately ninety (90) days from the date the solicitation is released. Applicants can download the solicitation from the IIPS Internet address above or obtain access through DOE/NETL?s website  at http://www.netl.doe.gov/business .  Paper copies are not available. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: The U. S. Congress looks to the Department of Energy (DOE) to work toward improving the energy efficiency of America?s most energy-intensive industries with special interest on industrial processing.  DOE, through its Office of Industrial Technologies (OIT), supports industries in their efforts to increase energy efficiency, reduce waste, and increase productivity.  The goal of OIT is to accelerate the development and use of advanced, energy efficient, renewable, and pollution prevention technologies that benefit industry, the environment, and U.S. energy security.  OIT?s core program is the Industries of the Future (IOF) Program that focuses on basic materials and processing industries such as the Mining Industry. In June 1998, the National Mining Association (NMA) and the Secretary of Energy signed a Compact  pledging to work together through research and development partnerships.  The objective of Solicitation No. DE-PS26-02NT41450 is another step in continuing to support this pledge by funding research and development projects which address research needs described in the Mineral Processing Technology Roadmap. The three key industry-identified areas, as presented in the Mineral Processing Technology Roadmap and which form the bases for the areas of interest under this solicitation, are: mineral preparation, physical separations, and chemical separations. Additional background information is provided in the National Mining Association?s Report, ?The Future Begins with Mining, A Vision of the Mining Industry of the Future (Sept. 1998)?,  which can be accessed at: http://www.oit.doe.gov/mining/pdfs/vision.pdf . No fiscal year 2002 (FY02) funds are available for this solicitation; selection and negotiation of successful offers leading to award of cost-shared financial assistance cooperative agreements is subject to availability of funding in FY03 and beyond.  An estimated $3.9 million in DOE funds is planned for this initiative as follows: approximately $1.3 million in FY03; $1.4 million in FY04; and $1.2 million in FY05.  Selection of successful offers are expected to be made on or before January 1, 2003, subject to availability of funding, with completion of negotiations and issuance of awards anticipated to occur within a reasonable timeframe thereafter.  Multiple (three to ten) awards are contemplated. A minimum fifty percent (50%) cost-share is required, i.e., if the total proposed project cost is estimated as $2 million, the government?s share would be no more than $1 million and the recipient?s share would be no less than $1 million. Any for-profit or non-profit organization, university or other institution of higher education, or non-federal agency or entity is eligible to apply, unless otherwise restricted by the Simpson-Craig amendment.  Applicants for financial assistance under this solicitation are subject to the eligibility requirements of Section 2306 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Foreign Company Participation.  EPAct provides further guidelines for companies who apply for financial assistance herein where the company's participation is to be in the economic interest of the U.S. and the company must either be U.S.- owned or incorporated in the U.S. with its parent company incorporated in a country that provides similar protections and privileges under U.S. law.  Applications submitted by or on behalf of (1) another Federal agency, a Federally-funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) or (3) a DOE Management and Operating (M&O) contractor will not be eligible for award under this solicitation. However, these organizations may be proposed as team members subject to the guidelines provided in the solicitation.  Applicants must include at least two (2) mining companies as members of the multi-disciplinary team. Multi-partner collaborations are encouraged. Once released, the solicitation will be available for downloading from the Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) Internet page ( http://e-center.doe.gov  ).   You must  register with IIPS, to enable you to submit an application. If you need technical assistance in registering, or for any other IIPS function, call the IIPS Help Desk at (800) 683-0751 or E-mail the Help Desk personnel at IIPS_HelpDesk@e-center.doe.gov (do not contact the Contract Specialist) .

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a Firm Fixed Price  modification to Contract N00019-99-C-1275 with Lockheed Martin Tactical Systems (LMTS).  This modification will be for non-recurring engineering development of Digital Instantaneous Frequency Measurement (DIFM) with a trial kit installation along with the option of eight (8) additional production kits.  This is an upgrade to the current P-3C Electronic Support Measures (ESM) System.  Included in this upgrade are speed of electronic s signal analysis, accuracy of target classification and identification, accuracy in determining the location of the emitter of interest, effective against modern frequency-agile radars, and the P-3C ESM system?s ability to operate effectively even in the most dense and threatening electronic environments.  The AIP DIFM kit will provide a precision ESM capability to augment the threat warning function by providing a frequency on every detected pulse, significantly reducing false alarms and a commensurate reduction in operator workload.  LMTS is the only source that possesses the necessary technical expertise, engineering drawings and other technical documentation to meet program requirements in a time frame that precludes a break in production and minimizes impact to the fleet.

The consultant on this task may suggest additional analyses for the report.  The product of this effort will be a report with sample written materials demonstrating how the definition of "scientifically based research" can be presented in a useful format for State and local school district personnel.
 
2 )  An analysis of the 4 factors and 3 levels of effectiveness set forth in the existing CSRD Continuum of Evidence of Effectiveness (Appendix B in the August 11, 2000 Guidance) in relation to (a) the definition of scientifically based research provided in the definition section of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and (b) the eleven components defined in that Act for a "comprehensive school reform program."  The product of this analysis is to be a report with recommendations for the development of a new or revised continuum as part of the Program?s non-regulatory guidance for State and local school districts.
 
3)	A draft revised or new continuum of effectiveness based on definition of "scientifically based research" in the ESEA.  Using the work products in task 1 and 2 above and at the direction of the CSRD Program Manager, the consultant will develop a complete revision of or a new table and related supporting materials (e.g., examples of studies that meet or do not meet the criteria; examples of school uses of the continuum; a decision tree for deciding whether a particular piece of evidence meets the criteria; etc.) of the continuum of effectiveness for assessing school reform research based on the ESEA definition of scientifically based research. 
 
4)	The first three deliverables should be rolled into a final three to 10 page stand-alone document OR document that would replace the existing Appendix B in the Guidance.
 
PROPOSALS
 
Offerors will propose between 60 and 70 days of work.  Proposals must contain:
 
1)  the number of days that they are available between February 13, 2002 and May 9, 2002 to perform the work described in this requirement;
2)  a statement regarding their most recent honorarium rate;
3)  a resume showing relevant qualifications and previous experience in Federal, State, and local comprehensive school reform initiatives and coordination among such initiatives;
4)  a daily rate and total proposal price.
 
Proposals should be faxed to 202-260-4023 by 5:00 PM EST on February 25, Attention: Hugh Burkett.  The Department is not responsible for travel expenses incurred, including airfare and per diem.
 
The Department contemplates one award resulting from this notice.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation which, if timely received, shall be considered by the agency.  Contact Hugh Burkett at 202-260-1989.  

TASK, TIMELINE AND DELIVERABLES - Task:  Develop Guidance to help practitioners identify and use scientifically based evidence of effectiveness for CSR models.  Timeline: Contractor will submit draft by March 11th at 5:00 PM at the latest and will submit final no later than four days after receiving comments from CSRD.  CSRD will provide comments no later than 10 business days after reviewing the final documents.

After receiving the first set of drafts and the first invoice payment equaling one half of total payment, will be submitted within 30 days.  After all deliverables meet CSRD requirements and an invoice is received, a payment of the remaining half will be submitted within 30 days. 

Hours and activities required to draft, edit, and complete deliverables should be provided with invoice.

Deliverables:  1.  Develop a new Continuum of Evidence of Effectiveness based on the new definition of scientifically based research. This might involve collapsing or rethinking the four types of research (e.g., does the definition of scientifically based apply to the research foundation? Does the replication criteria in the definition preclude a separate row for replicability?) as well as rethinking the distinctions between most rigorous, somewhat rigorous, and marginal evidence. 
2.	Define the five criteria of scientifically based research (NCLB) in plain language. Include a short guide listing characteristics of study design that fulfill the requirements of each criterion. Develop brief examples of research that would meet those criteria and explanations of how those examples illustrate each criterion. These examples would supplement or replace the existing Guidance examples in Appendix B. 
3.	Develop a decision tree for deciding whether a particular piece of evidence meets the criteria.
4.	The first three deliverables should be rolled into a final three to 10 page stand-alone document OR document that would replace the existing Appendix B in the Guidance.

<DESC>s existing regulations for KI  is contingent upon FDA approval or the NRC's accepting responsibility for the selected packaging/labeling format. 

ANSWER NO. 1----- The solicitation does not specifically tell the offeror the type of packaging.  Note however, that Packaging is an Evaluation Factor worth 20 points.  The solicitation states, "Packaging--Extent to which packaging provides for ease of distribution, storage, and maintains the integrity of the tablets."  Thus, NRC has left the method of packaging up to the offeror. 

QUESTION NO. 2----- Production Quantity?In order to offer the most competitive price, we propose manufacturing all tablets in one production lot. Our test data indicates that 10-year product old still meets or exceeds all FDA stability/shelf-life specifications. 

ANSWER NO. 2-----As stated in the solicitation, Task 1 - Initial Supply-- The Contractor shall be able to ship up to two million KI tablets no later than 20 calendar days from the effective date of the contract.  Task 2 - Subsequent Supply--The Contractor shall ship the specified amount of KI tablets to the location(s) identified in the delivery order no later than 48 hours from receipt of the delivery order from the NRC PO. The period of performance is two years from the effective date of the contract. Thus, delivery of the tablets shall be as stated in the solicitation within a two-year period of performance.  

QUESTION NO. 3-----Invoicing?As a result of the cost of production, we propose an initial invoice totaling 75 percent of the value of the contract on a net 30-day basis. Upon shipment of each order, we will invoice for the balance due, pro-rated according to the quantity shipped plus applicable shipping charges. Again terms would be net 30 days for each release.  

ANSWER NO. 3-----See Attachment 1, "Billing Instructions for Fixed Price Contracts."  

QUESTION NO. 4-----Shipment?We propose two shipping alternatives-UPS or FedEx. Pricing would be a function of the quantity shipped and the destination. A small administrative charge will be included to cover the cost of palletizing, handling, insurance and invoicing.  

ANSWER NO. 4-----As stated in the solicitation, the fixed unit price shall include ALL CHARGES, both direct and indirect, e.g., packaging and shipping costs.  Therefore, it is up to the offeror to determine the method of shipping.  UPS was given as an example in the solicitation.  Regardless of the shipping method used, as stated in the solicitation, the offeror is required to provide the NRC Project Officer with proof of delivery no later than 24 hours after delivery.  

QUESTION NO. 5-----Storage?We will provide insurance at purchaser's expense to prevent against loss in the event tablets are damaged or destroyed while awaiting shipment. It might make more economic sense for the NRC to consider taking delivery of the full shipment of six million tablets and store/ship from a central location, thereby avoiding this cost that we will pass along in addition to having better control over the timely delivery of this product.  

ANSWER NO. 5-----As stated in the solicitation, the Contractor shall be able to ship up to two million KI tablets (the initial supply) no later than 20 calendar days from the effective date of the contract.  Of the four million remaining KI tablets, the Contractor is required to ship the amount specified in the delivery order to the location(s) identified in the delivery order no later than 48 hours from receipt of the delivery order from the NRC PO.  The solicitation further states that the Contractor shall replace, AT NO COST TO THE NRC, any tablets that have been damaged or crushed during shipping. Again, the fixed unit price shall include all charges, both direct and indirect. 

QUESTION NO. 6-----Dosage Instructions?If the tablets are supplied in bulk or stripped only, the cost to provide individual patient product inserts in order to comply with existing FDA requirements, if applicable to this purchase, will be passed on to the purchaser.  

ANSWER NO. 6-----As stated in the solicitation, this is a commercial item acquisition.  The NRC is requesting a commercial product, as approved by the FDA, to be provided in the manner that it is commercially provided.  

QUESTION NO. 7-----Shipment-If we handle the shipment of the individual orders, such shipments can only be made within 48 hours FOLLOWING confirmed verbal contact with one of our two contacts.  

ANSWER NO. 7-----As stated in the solicitation, the Contractor shall be able to ship up to two million KI tablets (the initial supply) no later than 20 calendar days from the effective date of the contract.  Of the four million remaining KI tablets, the Contractor is required to ship the amount specified in the delivery order to the location(s) identified in the delivery order no later than 48 hours from receipt of the delivery order from the NRC PO.  

QUESTION NO. 8-----Lead-Time?How long a lead-time is there from receipt of bid award until tablets must be ready for shipment?  

ANSWER NO. 8-----As stated in the solicitation, the Contractor shall be able to ship up to two million KI tablets (the initial supply) no later than 20 calendar days from the effective date of the contract.  An award can be made any time after the closing date for receipt of proposals.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) requests information from companies interested in bidding on a follow-on contract for the Navy Standard Integrated Personnel System (NSIPS) program.  NSIPS is a Personnel and Pay system for Department of Navy (DoN) Active Duty and Reserve service members worldwide and provides personnel and pay support throughout the life cycle of a Service member's career.  NSIPS provides support during peacetime and war, through mobilization and demobilization, deployment and redeployment.  This follow-on effort will transition the NSIPS Client Server Database to a centralized database, web-enable it, and add an Electronic Service Record (ESR) capability.  NSIPS will continue to accommodate changes to both policy requirements and processes within the Navy personnel and pay functional arena for the life of the system.  The centralization, web-enablement, ESR and future enhancement efforts will be accomplished within the Navy Task Force Web (TFW) framework and must be developed in accordance with Navy-Marine Corps Intranet development guidelines. The security architecture must be implemented using Department of Defense DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology. NSIPS is based on the People Soft Release 8 version software and Oracle Release 8. Currently it is expected that Acquisition Information System (AIS) Category I and II personnel will be US citizens.  Such positions will be identified in future releases of information. This will be a full and open competition between all interested parties. The Government intends to award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract for a base year with 4 option years.  The estimated value over 5 yrs is approximately $60M.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) will sponsor its Third Annual Small Business Conference on May 19-22, 2002, in Orlando, Florida at the Orlando World Center Marriott & Convention Center.  The conference theme, "Roadmap to Government Contracting: Equipping you for the Journey" expresses the Department's goal to provide small business owners and associations the knowledge and tools required to gain contracting opportunities with DOE. The Department continues to be committed to fully engaging small businesses, including small disadvantaged, 8(a), women-owned businesses, and HUBZone small business concerns, in DOE's core missions.  DOE has exciting opportunities to offer small businesses in the areas of commodities, administrative services, science, security, and environmental quality and energy resources.  It is important that business leaders, advocates, and DOE program representatives celebrate the achievements of DOE small business partners, as well as build new and stronger alliances between the small business community and DOE laboratories. The highlights of the conference will include changes within the Department as a result of Administration initiatives as it relates to small businesses, security and e-commerce; small business issues for DOE; how to do business with DOE and its laboratories; and available business opportunities. Additionally, DOE will be inviting other Federal Agencies with correlating missions to participate in our conference as members of panels and as exhibitors. Interagency partnering provides maximum benefit to all small business concerns both in contracting opportunities as well as a vast knowledge of federal contracting in general. This conference will build on the success of last year?s conference and will benefit both small business concerns and DOE.   It is through outreach activities such as this that the Department finds small businesses with the capabilities to match its contracting opportunities.   For more information or to register, please visit the conference website located at http://www.smallbusiness-outreach.doe.gov/.  DOE looks forward to your participation.

<DESC>MAIL PROCESSING EQUIPMENT SALE.  The Postal Service is offering for sale to the general public, including major mailers, equipment brokers, and other entrepreneurs, excess Flat Sorter Machines (FSM 881), together with software license, documentation, and service support. The basic system, including software license, has been sold for as little as $55,000.00.  Properly processed mail to the obtain 3 and 5-digit rates can result in savings of tens of thousands of dollars per month for certain volumes of flat mail.  The systems will be available at mail processing centers across the United States until about June 2002.  
DESCRIPTION: The FSM 881 is a mechanized flat sorter with four feed stations (two on each end of the machine). It sorts to 100-bin separations and has barcode capability. In FY 99, it was equipped with a Flat Mail Optical Character Reader (FMOCR), which was installed on each side of the module following each set of input stations. It can read a 5-digit, 9-digit, or 11-digit barcode placed in virtually any location on the face of the flat mailpiece and orientated parallel to any edge.  PRODUCTIVITY: The FMOCR significantly enhances the barcode flat mail savings by providing the capability to process barcode and non-barcode flats on the same sort program.  The modified FSM 881 has the capability to receive keyhits manually, to process the mail without the intervention of a keyer by automatic address recognition and sorting, or to process the mail by reading the barcode. The FSM 881 has a maximum sort rate of approximately 14,000 pieces per machine hour when using a 100-bin sort program and approximately 20,600 when using two 50-bin sort programs. The design of the FSM 881 allows flexibility in processing up to four individual sort plans simultaneously.  When the cost of processing flats in the manual operation was $63.62 per 1,000 pieces, the cost of processing flats in the mechanized mode was only $39.82 per 1,000 pieces. The cost to process bar-coded flats through automation was $27.44 per 1,000 pieces.  Presort rates offer substantial savings.  Flat size piece presort to 3-digit zip codes eligible for automation results in postage of savings 25.5% of the basic non-automation rate.  For presort to 5-digit zip codes, the savings is 41.7% of the basic non-automation rate.
