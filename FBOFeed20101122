The intent is to eventually deploy data analysis capabilities to all AF aircraft.</p>
<p>Technical Ability to Perform Contract: The contractor should have an understanding of the employment of FOQA and ASAP in the civilian industry and how those experiences translate into the military environment. The contractor should have extensive experience performing technological tasks and supervising personnel involved in various technological tasks, such as: obtaining and using data from flight data recorder devices, using flight data analysis software, managing flight data databases, analyzing and trending flight data, distributing resulting analytical products, experience developing and supporting web-based applications, and compiling and analyzing safety hazard reports in narrative format.

<DESC>Notice for a SOLE SOURCE requirement in accordance with the 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6, 6.302-1, Only one responsible source, for Global Positioning System (GPS) collars with the ability to change the duty cycle of the collars remotely, capable of on demand, two-way radio communication between the collars and the user.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Contracting and General Services Office in Denver, Colorado intends to award Sole Source to Lotek Wireless Inc., 115 Pony Drive, Newmarket, Ontario L3Y 7B5, for a commodity (product) requirement, to include shipping Lotek Model 4400M, Quantity 3; Unit of Issue Each.
USFWS believes that Lotek Model 4400M is the only source that incorporates the ability to change the duty cycle remotely and provides two-way radio communication between the collar and user.  In addition, a command unit, connections and some collars were previously purchased under another order.  Only the same make and model will satisfy the agency's needs for these additional units.  Purchase of any other make would result in incompatibilities and substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.   
Any parties who feel they have the capabilities required to do the above are welcome to provide documentation on their expertise and qualifications for consideration by 17 December 2010, 10:00 AM ET (8:00 AM MT).  All such documentation should be sent to the point of contact listed in this announcement.  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. The intent of this announcement is to determine if any source(s) exist.  Therefore, a solicitation will not be made available.  
All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  
The USFWS point of contact for this requirement is Jacqueline Carter, Contract Specialist at 303-236-4772, jacqueline_e_carter@fws.gov, FAX 303-236-4791.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award sole source contracts to State Agencies for Egg Inspections. The State Agencies must have the authority and capability necessary to gain access to private commercial establishments in order to conduct regulatory inspections in accordance with the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. On July 9, 2009, FDA published a final rule requiring shell egg producers to implement certain measures to prevent salmonella enteritidis (SE) from contaminating eggs on the farm from further growth during storage and transportation. The final rule, which is codified in 21 CFR 118, will be implemented in a staggered fashion with larger producers (greater than 50,000 layers) required to be in compliance by July 9, 2010 and smaller producers (3,000-49,999 layers) being in compliance by July 9, 2012. It is anticipated that awards will be made for a 12 month contract period to the larger producers this fiscal year only. The solicitation will be available on or about December 15, 2010 on the FedBizOpps website at http://fedbizopps.gov. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and amendments. Hard copies will be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act upon request. The proposed contract actions are for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only once source as authorized by statute under the authority of FAR 6.302-5. This notice is issued for informational purposes and is not a request for competitive proposals. Any interested party should submit a statement of capabilities in sufficient detail to determine if the requirements of this synopsis can be met no later than 15 days from the date of this announcement. A determination by Government not to compete the proposed contracts based on responses from this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses to this notice must be sent via email to Allison.Mlawsky@fda.hhs.gov. No phone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation is to obtain Communication Trailers as defined in the solicitation, for local, Regional, and Nationwide fire suppression, and all-hazard incidents. We anticipate issuing the solicitation approximately 15 days after the date of this notice. The Government anticipates awarding multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements.A single, national solicitation will be issued to obtain these services. This solicitation will be issued using the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) system and to use VIPR, you must have access to a computer and the internet. Basic information you will need to be aware of to participate in this solicitation is located on the web at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.User guides and other information regarding VIPR are posted at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.phpIn addition to the basic requirements referred to above, there are two very important things you must do in order to submit an offer utilizing the VIPR system:1) Download Formatta Filler software to be able to view the solicitation package and complete the online forms used in submitting your offer. A link to this software and installation instructions are available at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.php.2) Obtain Level 2 eAuthentication. Users play a key role in ensuring that information requested for VIPR is protected. The government now requires a higher level of security for information transmitted by individuals to the government for electronic business (including that conducted by VIPR). Therefore, the Forest Service requires secure user accounts through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Level 2 eAuthentication system. Only individuals from your company who plan to sign the preseason incident agreement(s) must obtain a Level 2 eAuthentication account. The Level 2 credentials go beyond simply applying for an account online - Level 2 also ensures that your identity is verified in-person, and by doing so, helps prevent identity theft or fraud. The Forest Service has prepared numerous resources to assist vendors in obtaining a Level 2 eAuthentication account, which are posted to the Forest Service Incident Procurement (IP) website: http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php. Contracting Office Address: 709 W. 9th Street, Rm 501D - AQM Juneau, AK 99801Point of Contact(s): Deb Strickland, 907-586-7902, dstrickland@fs.fed.us, 709 W. 9th St., Rm 501D-AQM, Juneau, AK 99801;Teri Sabin, 715-479-2724, tasabin@fs.fed.us, 560 Loon Lake Road, Eagle River, Wisconsin, 54521

<DESC>Introduction:&nbsp; The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID has a requirement for Respiratory Diseases Research Centers to support translational and clinical research for a variety of viral and bacterial respiratory diseases.<br /><br />Description:&nbsp; Under the current contracts, research progress has been made in several key areas. A major emphasis of the contract for vaccine respiratory pathogens research has been evaluating strategies to improve the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in populations at increased risk for complications from influenza and clinical studies of influenza vaccines with pandemic potential. The contract for bacterial respiratory pathogens research has focused on the development of a human challenge model for nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, treatment strategies for pseudomonas infections, and diagnostic methods to discriminate between colonization and infection with S. pneumoniae. These contracts have also provided resources for the respiratory diseases research community, including reagents (e.g. strains, reagents, clinical specimens, data, etc.) and services (e.g., assay support and training).&nbsp; The purpose of this solicitation is to recompete this research program, under the title "Respiratory Pathogens Research Centers" (RPRC), to continue to provide DMID with the capability of conducting translational and clinical research focused on the development and optimization of control measures for viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. Under the RPRC program, research on the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, as well as influenza and RSV and the impact of bacterial/viral co-infections on disease progression and severity will be emphasized.&nbsp; The RFP will be composed of two parts with separate contracts to be awarded for each Part: <br />
<p><br />PART A: Viral Respiratory Pathogens Research Center (VRPRC)<br />PART B: Bacterial Respiratory Pathogens Research Center (BRPRC)</p>
<p>Together, these programs comprise the NIAID Respiratory Pathogens Research Center (RPRC), which fills an important gap in NIAID's respiratory diseases research portfolio by supporting multidisciplinary translational and clinical research projects focused on developing information and tools and the evaluation of improved strategies for controlling these infections.&nbsp; Each new contract will be awarded as a term (level of effort), cost-reimbursement contract with a base period (one year) and six one-year options to extend the term for a total of seven years. Additional options to incrementally increase effort each year may be required to respond to emerging needs. The activities to be supported under the term portion of the contract will include: 1) Establishment and Maintenance of the VRPRC/BRPRC; 2) VRPRC/BRPRC Translational Research Studies; 3) VRPRC/BRPRC Clinical Research Studies; 4) Project Development; 5) VRPRC/BRPRC Innovation Research Projects; 6) Provision of VRPRC/BRPRC Resources; 7) Provision/Release of VRPRC/BRPRC Data; 8) External Scientific Advisory Group; 9) Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources; and 10) Project Management.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, each contract will contain completion type options for the conduct of Phase 0/I, II, and III clinical trials and at least two innovation research projects each year for a period limited to two years each.&nbsp;&nbsp;All options are subject to being exercised at the discretion of the Government and are subject to the availability of funds.</p>
<p>A total level of effort of 16,032 total direct labor hours per year based on a Work Year of 1,920 productive work hours (excluding vacation, holiday, sick leave) is required for each contract for a period of performance of seven years (Base period plus six, one-year Options). In any year of the contract, contractors must also be able to respond to requests to provide additional effort based on the exercise of Options in increments of 3,840, 5,760 or 9,600 direct labor hours (approximately 2 FTEs, 3 FTEs, and 5 FTEs, respectively) to increase the existing level-of-effort by up to a maximum not to exceed 15,360 total direct labor hours (approximately&nbsp;8 FTEs).</p>
<p>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about December 6, 2010 and may be accessed through FedBizOpps <a href="http://www.fbo.gov/">http://www.fbo.gov/</a>. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>BARDA - Strategic Science and Technology Division<br />Broad Agency Announcement Synopsis Notice
<p>Science and Technology Platforms Applied to Medical Countermeasure (MCM) Development</p>
<p>The Office of Acquisition Management Contracts &amp; Grants (AMCG) with the office of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provides an integrated, systematic approach to the development and purchase of the necessary vaccines, drugs, therapies, and diagnostic tools for public health medical emergencies. BARDA/AMCG's mission includes managing the advanced research and development of medical countermeasures (MCM) for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents (CBRN), as well as the advanced development and procurement of medical countermeasures for pandemic influenza and other emerging infectious diseases that fall outside the auspices of Project BioShield.</p>
<p>Preparedness mission and priorities are articulated in the HHS Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) Implementation Plan for CBRN Threats and the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza. The implementation plans are located on the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) website http://www.phe.gov/preparedness/pages/default.aspx and the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza on the website http://www.pandemicflu.gov.</p>
<p>The Pandemic and All Hazard Preparedness Act (PAHPA) directs BARDA to promote (i) innovations in technologies that may assist countermeasure and product advanced research and development, (ii) research on and development of research tools and other devices and technologies, and (iii) research to promote strategic initiatives. Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), BARDA seeks to advance the technological and scientific advancements of medical countermeasures for biodefense and emerging infectious disease threats, including pandemic influenza. The PAHPA is located on the ASPR website http://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/pahpa/pages/default.aspx.</p>
<p>This BAA is a continuation of a previous BAA (BARDA-BAA-09-100-SOL-0010) and is similarly designed to promote science and technology advancements of platforms applied to MCM development for the Strategic Science and Technology Division (SST) of BARDA/AMCG and will be open to all responsible Offerors. The Government's intent is to solicit potential advancements in science and technology in the following BARDA SST Areas of Interest:</p>
<p>1. Technologies to accelerate evaluation of vaccines and therapeutics.</p>
<p>2. Formulation chemistry, protein stabilization, and vaccine delivery technologies.</p>
<p>3. Innovative methods in bioprocess development and manufacturing.</p>
<p>4. Methods and technologies to advance development of tests for rapid diagnosis of human injury and infection.</p>
<p>The BARDA SST Areas of Interest are designed to target platform technologies focused on (1) product improvements to enhance the safety, efficacy, and ease of use of MCM, (2) reducing time and cost of MCM development, evaluation, and manufacturing, and (3) development of innovative diagnostic platforms for the rapid diagnosis of priority pathogens. The specific application of the technologies will focus on biodefense, pandemic influenza, and other emerging infectious diseases (EID). BARDA is open to evaluation of technologies at multiple stages of product development. BARDA anticipates that demonstrating utility of these novel platform technologies will generate validated data suitable for comparability analysis with candidate products and have direct application to commercial-scale manufacturing or testing processes. The development activities are to be fully integrated with regulatory activities associated with product development efforts.</p>
<p>BARDA anticipates awarding multiple contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, and/or other transactions for research and development efforts from this BAA that have sufficient potential for success, are of interest to the Government, and support one or more of the listed BARDA SST Areas of Interest.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC>In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, the Department of Army intends to contract using other than full and open competition for the DoD Counter-Narcoterrorism Technology Program Office (CNTPO) for Public Communications Support and Facilitation in the CENTCOM and SOUTHCOM areas of responsibility to The Rendon Group, 1875 Connecticut Avenue, Washington, D.C. 20009.  The contractor will provide multiple echelons of counter narcotic (CN) public communications support and facilitation on behalf of the DoD to assist the U.S. Embassies and Ministries of Defense (MOD) and Interior (MOI) for South and Central American countries to include, but not limited to, the Republic of Colombia and Middle Eastern countries to include, but not limited to, Pakistan, hereafter referred to as the MOD.  The development of communications support and facilitation will be achieved primarily by allowing host nation personnel to learn on the job from real-time illustrative assistants provided by the contractor during numerous communication activities and events over the period of performance.  There will be many audiences for the counterdrug public communications products developed and utilized by MODs and MOIs under this program.  None of the products developed or proposed under this contract are intended for US audiences.  The objective of efforts in Pakistan is to (a) provide training and support to the Pakistan Government to increase their capability to use public communications as a means of building national and international support for counterdrug and related initiatives; (b) to develop a public engagement strategy for implementation by the Pakistan Government and third party valuators to initiate, maintain and drive public conversation related to the overall mission objective; and (c) provide open source media analysis of English, Pashtu and Urdu print and electronic media in support of the U.S. Embassy.  The objective of efforts in Colombia is to (a) continue to work with the Colombian Ministry of Defense (MoD) to inform the Colombian public and the world community on the negative impact of the drug trade and the efforts of the Government of Colombia to thwart drug trafficking; (b) train Colombian MoD personnel on the proper way to interface with the media in the field; (c) presenting the MoDs message to the public; and (d) continuing to develop tactical media products to aide in CN activities.<BR>This is a continuation effort and leverages achievements gained over an extended period.  Responsible sources may identify their interest and must clearly demonstrate their capability to respond to the requirement.  At a minimum, interested parties must demonstrate the following capabilities: (1) established senior level government official (civilian and military) relationships within the regions; (2) currently available personnel with the requisite qualifications to satisfy this requirement; and (3) ability to meet the short timeline of implementation (full implementation no later than January 31, 2011).  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no proposals will be entertained.  However, all responses received within fifteen (15) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<BR>Interested vendors who may wish to seek subcontracting opportunities should contact the above named company directly.<BR><BR>Place of Contract Performance.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY for market research purposes to identify interested vendors for the requirement detailed below. A formal Solicitation, with Performance Work Statements or Technical Exhibits is not available for review at this time. Information obtained from this sources sought notice may result in a future formal Request for Proposal. The Government reserves the right to set-aside any subsequent acquisition based upon known sources and/or responses to this synopsis.
<p>We are conducting research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience needed to meet the requirement to collect supersonic guided and unguided projectile fly-out data. The offeror must be able to track two projectiles in-flight simultaneously to collect and produce time, space, and position information (TSPI) which is accurate and precise from first light through the endgame. It will be necessary to correlate the TSPI data to other test events such as first light and first motion. Projectile roll-rate and attitude data are also required. One hour after each launch event, the contractor must provide quick look data to the test engineer. Thirty days after the conclusion of the test event, the offeror must provide a final and complete data package.</p>
<p>Services will be conducted at remote locations, such as Ft Bliss, Tonopah Test Range, White Sands Missile Range, China Lake or Eglin AFB. Tentatively, the test dates are 1 Sep2011 - 15 Nov 2016. Projectiles will be fired from several different locations, late at night, 5 days a week.<br /><br />To support this activity, the government may provide the following equipment: generators to support field operations, and fuel to run the generators. In addition, fuel for the generators will be delivered and any required field maintenance of the generators will be provided by the government. If radars are provided by the government, the contractor shall present documentation which certifies the offeror is qualified to operate and perform field maintenance.</p>
<p>The offeror must provide all other equipment and services necessary to collect and deliver the required data. These activities may include, but are not limited to the following: set-up and movement of radars, generators, instrumentation and other support equipment; maintenance of radars and offeror equipment while in the field; participation in daily test readiness reviews; providing all other equipment, software and services necessary to deliver the data requested. The system will have to be able to track high-speed (up to 2000m/s) guided/unguided projectiles, as well as weapons with low/flat trajectories (as low as two meters) and low-radar cross sections. The system will have to be deployed with both visible high speed cameras along, all integrated on a high-performance tracking pedestal. It will have to capture and produce highly-accurate positional information from launch to impact. Data will be further combined within the system post test to produce an accurate time-correlated flight path. The objective accuracy of the system is to resolve the position of the target projectile within one meter at a range of 20 kilometers.</p>
<p>Offerors offering simultaneous projectile tracking capability using radars other than HAWK radars are also acceptable. Offerors shall identify the equipment they are qualified on and if the offeror will provide their own equipment or will require Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).</p>
<p>Data collected is anticipated to be classified as SECRET/US only. The offeror must be domestic and may not partner or subcontract with a foreign business entity in support of the data collection activities. Offerors must have SECRET facility clearance, SECRET storage capability and provide a minimum of 2 personnel cleared to handle SECRET data. Only offerors that meet the description of this requirement need to respond.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code for this effort is 517919, with a small business size standard of $25M.</p>
<p>All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package which explicitly demonstrates capabilities and expertise related to this effort. The capabilities package should include the following:</p>
<p>1) The Offeror must identify all the equipment to be provided/operated for the purpose of providing the data defined in this Sought Synopsis (see attachment 1).</p>
<p>2) Identification of radar equipment the contractor is certified to operate and maintain.</p>
<p>3) Tracking system performance information such as range, rate of position update, tracking acceleration.</p>
<p><br />4) If the offeror has provided this service in the past, list the number and percent of missiles tracked.</p>
<p>5) The offeror may provide information about any other tracking tests they have supported; pertinent information would be objective of test, and data products provided. <br /><br />Your package should demonstrate capabilities, expertise and past performance relevant to the requirements cited above as well as your size in accordance with the size standard; ensure that the company name, address, a point of contact with email address and telephone number, Federal CAGE code and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number are included in the capabilities package.<br /><br />TEST DATA REQUIRED:</p>
<p>1. Set up description<br />2. Time Space Position Information (TSPI) data<br />3. Closest point of approach<br />4. Miss distance<br />5. First light Inter Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) time (to the millisecond)<br />6. First Doppler IRIG time (to the millisecond)<br />7. Boost time (to the millisecond)<br />8. Radar bore-sight video (standard NTSC video/30 FPS)<br />9. Velocity vs. Time Plots<br />10. XYZ in Target Frame vs. Time Plots<br />11. Doppler Time Intensity Plots (DTI's)</p>
<p><br />THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY for market research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation is being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Participation is strictly voluntary with no cost or obligation to be incurred by the Government.</p>

The intent of this RFI is to provide the AFRISS-TF Program Management Office with market research and insight to help assess the capability of available technologies, and the long-term visibility of potential approaches and solutions to integrate the two systems indicated above into the AFRISS-R baseline with subsequent limited sustainment of the new system. The solution must support a secure system, applying Business Rule Information Management (BRIM) to create, amend and adjudicate information on applicants seeking entry into the Air Component. In addition, the new system must be able to produce a myriad of reports, and provide and receive data to and from other external agencies.
<p>This RFI should not be construed as a commitment by the Air Force, Air National Guard, or the Air Force Reserve to issue a solicitation or to ultimately award a contract. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to the RFI. This RFI is in no way binding to the government. The government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this request. The information will be used to facilitate acquisition planning; any proprietary information will be handled accordingly. The determination of an acquisition strategy, based upon comments submitted by interested parties in response to this RFI is solely within the discretion of the government. The NAICS Code 541512, Computer System Design Services, is subject to change based on market research and input from industry to the Program Office.</p>

<DESC>GSA SCHEDULE HOLDERS ONLY
This Request for Information (RFI) has also been posted on GSA e-Buy (RFQ531356) as a Sources Sought/RFI.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is conducting market research. This RFI is being used to determine the availability and capability of a GSA Schedule Holder that can provide a Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) Power Utility Computer System (PUCS) that encompasses the spectrum of services of a typical electric utility, to include but not be limited to: customer billing and collection, accounting, inventory, engineering, maintenance, and mapping.  The BIA has used multiple systems in the past, and wishes to consolidate the functionality into a single system that meets the needs of the three BIA power projects operated directly by federal employees as well as meeting the needs of the users, in order to reduce costs, improve efficiency and improve consistency.  
Three BIA power utilities- Colorado River Agency (CRA), San Carlos Irrigation Project (SCIP) and Truxton Canon Agency (hereafter called Utilities) all located in Arizona are seeking to replace the current systems and software suites with a fully integrated Utility Management Software Suite.  The new Utility Management Software shall perform the following functions:
* Accounting capability for reporting using Rural Utility Services (RUS) Form 7; * Engineering, planning and design;* Customer Information System (CIS) Billing/Collections;* Inventory for warehousing functions (Bill of Material);* Automated Staking;* Outage Management;* Work/Service Order Processes; * Maintenance;* Metering Software System Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI); and* Engineering and modeling software capabilities (i.e., Windmill Software Ltd.?).
The new Utility Management Software shall interface with the following Department of the Interior (DOI) or BIA Systems:
* Mapping to interface with BIA's Geographic database software (ESRI);and* Federal Financial System (FFS); 
The software shall be user friendly and compatible with current PC, Database (Oracle 11g or SQL 2008 or higher), and server operating systems.  The system shall be capable of running 24x7x365 with minimal supervision.  The system shall be designed for a customer base up to 30,000 customers.  The servers shall be located in Albuquerque, NM at the BIA 2 facility for system operation and backup to tape or disk.  Additionally, a Disaster Recovery (DR) solution shall be designed for placement in Herndon, VA.
The system shall be capable of sustaining up to 250 concurrent users at any given instance.  The system shall be capable of running queries of past history on customers.  These queries may be a combination of formatted and limited data display queries to highly complex queries, as well as routine and specialized reports seen in a relational database managed system. 
Summary of the requirements of the new system:
1. Convert and migrate data from current application to a new SQL or ORACLE based system;2. Be able to interface with Automated Meter Reading (AMR) systems.  Currently utilizing Turtle software;3. Maintain customer information and history;4. Produce periodic electricity usage billing statements;5. Process customer payments and produce receipts;6. Produce work orders for new services, disconnects, line problems;7. Be able to segregate customer service personnel abilities by different types of profiles.8. Must require periodic password changes (every 90 days); and9. Hardware (Servers) will be hosted and managed by the government in the BIA Albuquerque data center                 with a backup system at an Eastern location.
One of the current applications is 20 years old, programmed in RPG and Cobol.  There is no actual database, simply a group of flat file tables that are programmatically linked and accessed.  Consequently there is no current data dictionary of what information is contained in what table.
Responding to this RFI:
The capability package for this RFI is not expected to be a proposal, but rather statements and descriptions about the company's existing experience (and past performance) regarding the Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) Power Utility Computer System (PUCS) described in this RFI. Areas where the contractor does not have prior experience should be noted as such. 
RFI responses must also include:
1. Business name and your GSA Schedule number;2. The SIN for your GSA Schedule contract and provide documentation as to how this requirement is within the     scope of that SIN;3. The business classification (i.e. Large Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Native American, etc.) and     NAICS code used;4. Name of primary point of contact; title; email address; and phone number of a company representative the     Government may contact for additional information; 5. Name of key individuals who collaborated on the RFI response; and6. If planning to team with another GSA Schedule holder, please identify the contractor and their GSA Schedule     number.
NOTE: This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) will take procurement action in this matter. Further, neither BIA nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information. RFIs may be used when the Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes. Responses to these notices are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. 
Submission Instructions:
Responses are due no later than 5:00 EST on Tuesday, November 30, 2010 via email to Cathleen.Fraser@bia.gov and Raymond.Griffith@bia.gov.  Please direct any questions regarding this RFI to Mr. Raymond Griffith, telephone number (703) 735-1111 or via email at Raymond.Griffith@bia.gov.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of potential sources including all small business categories (i.e., HUBZone firms; certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses; and women-owned small businesses). The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to these services is 493120, Refrigerated Warehousing and Storage, and the associated size standard is $25.5M. This notice is for planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals or Request for Quotes. This announcement is for market research purposes only and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation for the services or items contained herein. All responses shall be submitted at the discretion of the respondent. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this sources sought. Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is seeking sources to provide centralized vaccine distribution of all vaccines purchased by CDC and States under the Vaccines for Children Program (VFC), CDC adult vaccine programs, and applicable State programs. Specifically, the distribution process includes receipt, storage, picking, packing, and shipping of refrigerated and frozen vaccines and also the storage and rotation of pediatric stockpile vaccines.</p>
<p>Description of Services:</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to receive, store, pick, pack, and ship publicly-funded and state-purchased vaccine. Estimated annual volume is approximately 468,000 refrigerated shipments of approximately 90 million doses of vaccine product to roughly 44,000 providers who administer vaccine.</p>
<p>CDC places bulk vaccine orders via its federal contracts with vaccine manufacturers to create an inventory at designated distribution centers. In addition, there are some smaller nonfederal contracts used by State programs to replenish bulk inventory. The distributor receives individual provider orders through CDC's proprietary electronic ordering system for distribution. Individual Provider orders are entered into CDC's ordering system, and approved or held by 63 different Projects Areas comprised of states, selected major cities, and U.S. territories. Approved orders are sent electronically in a standard format from the CDC-approved system through an approved electronic network to the storage facilities. The orders are shipped directly from the storage facilities to the providers on a first expired, first out basis.</p>
<p>A small number of providers are not accessible through standard commercial carriers.<br /><br />&bull; Vaccines distributed to providers in the six Pacific Islands (American Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, N. Mariana Islands and Palau) are delivered to a central depot or airport in each of the islands.</p>
<p>&bull; Vaccines are shipped to a single depot in Alaska serving all Alaska providers.</p>
<p>The centralized distribution includes both vaccines purchased through the federal contracts with vaccine manufacturers and vaccines purchased through non-federal (i.e., state) contracts for the 63 Project Areas. Vaccines purchased through the federal contract will be held in a single physical inventory (not Project-specific). Vaccines purchased through Project contracts (non-federal) will be held in a single physical inventory, with Project-specific virtual inventory tracking and reporting required. Average throughput per month is approximately 36,500 orders with a low of approximately 24,000 orders per month and high months totaling approximately 65,500 orders per month. Average order size is approximately 190 doses. The pediatric stockpiles stored at the centralized vaccine distributor consist of 11 vaccine products totaling approximately 3.5 million doses; however, the number of products and total number of doses to be held in stockpile may change as a result of programmatic requirements.</p>
<p>Responsible parties capable of providing these services must respond in writing to the attention of the Contract Specialist listed in this announcement by December 6, 2010 at 4:00 p.m. ET. (NAICS) code applicable to these services is 493120, Refrigerated Warehousing and Storage, and the associated size standard is $25.5M. Capable parties must also provide in writing their business size relative to the NAICS Code listed.</p>
<p>As a part of your response to this notice, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. A full description of your capability to adequately store vaccines.<br />2. A description of your capability and approach to vaccine receipt, storage, picking, packing, and shipping.<br />3. A representation as to your business size relative to NAICS Code 493120, Size $25.5 Million.</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a solicitation or a commitment by the Government to later publish a solicitation. No solicitation document is available. Information obtained from this announcement may be used to refine future requirements or develop future acquisition strategies. Capable parties must submit their ability to provide these services in writing to the attention of the Contract Specialist listed in this announcement by December 1, 2010 at 4:00 p.m. ET. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government's assessment of the information received.</p>

<DESC>DLA Disposition Services seeks sources with the capability and interest to provide specific services consisting of draining and purging a variety of military vehicles and equipment of assorted fluids, refrigerants, removing batteries, and containerizing waste fluids and batteries as appropriate. Services may also include compliant disposal of removed refrigerants, though disposal of waste fluids and batteries would be part of other existing contracts. The services under this possible action, however, could also include analysis of certain removed fluids for waste characterization. Examples of the items to be serviced are included in the attachment to this announcement, and the possible locations requiring service are also attached. It is anticipated that interested firms may not necessarily have the capability to service all sites, but at a minimum it is expected that any subsequent contract(s) would be organized to provide coverage to different geographic areas consisting of the sites within that area, such as several states in a region. Also, it is anticipated that services at the sites would be on an as-needed, intermittent basis, which will not likely amount to a large number of service hours at any single site within, for example, an annual period. Estimates thus far do not indicate that any specific single site would need more than 80 hours of service annually. The corresponding NAICs code is 811310, with possible set-aside aspects of any resulting procurement action(s) to be determined in part based upon responses to this sources sought announcement.
<p>Firms with the capability and interest to provide the services are encouraged to submit a brief indication of such, to the point of contact within this announcement, by close of business on 30 Nov 2010. In addition to a brief summary of your capability to provide the services, please include any/all socioeconomic designation(s) applicable to your firm when responding to this sources sought announcement. Questions/clarifications may be referred to the point of contact.</p>

<p>SCOPE OF WORK <br /><br /><br />The painting will be done in the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Rall Building, SC101, E-Module, First, Second, Third, and Fourth Floors laboratory hallways and all elevator lobbies.</p>
<p>I. E Module Hallways Painting Specifications:<br />A. Removal of Attached Bulletin Boards<br />The Contractor will be required to remove bulletin boards from the hallway walls before the start of the preparation and painting to allow painting in these locations. There are approximately 10 - 15 bulletin boards of various sizes on each floor that are fastened with screws to the walls. The occupants will be requested to remove all papers and posters from the bulletin boards and walls although some items may remain - the Contractor will remove with care any remaining non-permanent items and will store in areas as directed by the Government project officer. These items will not reinstalled by the Contractor. The Government project officer will show the Contractor employees the locations to store the bulletin boards. The bulletin boards will be removed after 1:00 PM the day before the weekend painting will begin. The Contractor will be responsible for reinstalling the bulletin boards in the same location after the completion of the painting. The bulletin boards will be installed level. The Contractor will be required to drill additional holes and supply any screws if needed.<br /><br /><br />B. Hallway Wall Painting<br />The nominal area of walls to be painted is 18,000 square feet. The pre-painted metal hallway walls shall be painted on the hallway side walls only. No interior laboratory room walls will be painted. Wall paint shall be Sherwin-Williams Proclassic Waterborne or equivalent styrene-based acrylic, eggshell or satin finish, color SW7036 Accessible Beige. All wall preparation shall be according to the paint manufacturer's specifications including removal adhesive materials used to fasten posters and other items to the walls. The paint will be applied to full opacity. The Contractor is responsible for the protection of adjacent areas from paint and other activities due to the painting. The Contractor is responsible for the prompt removal of paint from the floors and adjacent areas.</p>
<p>C. Hallway Door and Door Frame Painting<br />All hallway hollow metal doors and door frames will be painted in the three floors with partial painting on one floor: a total of approximately (110) - 4 &frac12; feet wide by 9 feet high double lab doors, (8) - 6 feet wide by 7 feet high double doors, and (33) - 3 feet wide by 7 feet doors. Both sides of the doors and frames will be painted (some doors have limited access on the laboratory side of the doors and may not be painted as per the Government project officer. The paint will be low volatile organic compound (VOC), high solids alkyd paint equivalent to Sherwin-Williams Proclassic Enamel. All paint, primer, cleaner, and other chemical material safety data sheets (MSDS) will be supplied at least two week in advance before the painting begins by the Contractor. No work can begin unless the MSDS sheets have been reviewed and approved by the NIEHS Health and Safety Branch. The colors will be Sherwin-Williams colors - number SW7039, semi-gloss for the door jambs; number SW7038 Tony Taupe, satin for the small doors of the lab double doors and all single doors, and SW7036 Accessible Beige, satin for the large doors of the lab double doors and the two sets of fire double doors.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.

This notice constitutes as a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N00178-11-Q-1902 which solicits/requests white papers for Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD).  White papers including a rough order of magnitude (ROM) which are meaningful proposals with varying technical/scientific approaches towards advancing the state of the art technologies used in targeting systems may be submitted.
  There is an urgent need for novel technologies capable of improving targeting accuracy.  
 
DESCRIPTION:  The current topic areas of interest/objectives include but are not limited to:  

Topic: A. Azimuth Sensing Technology
There is an urgent need for technologies capable of improving azimuth determination.  Current weapon systems are able to engage targets with an accuracy that exceeds existing targeting equipment capabilities.  Laser designation is presently the only practical solution to the accuracy problem; however, the drawback is that the operator is vulnerable to counterattacks during the designation.  Accurate knowledge of a users location coupled with range, azimuth, and elevation to target, will allow for a targets location to be known well enough to call for a precision strike.
 

The goal is to provide a non-magnetic azimuth sensing capability for use in handheld targeting devices to allow the user a level of self navigation (6 Degrees Of Freedom).  The technology shall reduce Target Location Errors (TLE) associated with digital magnetic compasses; as well as allow for operation in urban environments, near vehicles, day or night, inside buildings and while wearing body armor.  The technology will be an improvement to the accuracy available from a digital magnetic compass regardless of the magnetic environment.  The goal is to eventually reduce TLE to less than 10m, thereby permitting accurate target location at ranges of up to 10km from observer to target.  The limitations imposed by user objectives are not conducive to GPS interferometers and celestial compass technologies.
  The most promising solutions are currently based on gyro-compassing; however, novel ideas are encouraged. 

Desired Capabilities:  a) Could be integrated into a handheld application; b) Less than 1 mil vertical angle accuracy; c) Boresightable to optics; d) Volume no more than 1 cu in; e) 1 mil azimuth accuracy; f) 0.25 lb; g) 360 degrees per second operational slew rate (without recalibration); h) Less than 60 sec start-up time.

Topic: B . Laser Target Designation Technology
Currently fielded USMC Laser Target Designators (LTDs) emit a laser which is encoded with Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) codes.  These LTDs are class IV lasers and emit 30-80 milliJoules (mJ) of laser energy.  A 50-80 mJ system typically weighs 12 lbs, and a 30-50 mJ system typically weighs 4 lbs.

The USMC is interested in novel technologies and materials which are able to reduce the size, weight, electrical power, and cost (both system and sustainment cost) of conventional, PRF-encoded LTDs.

Topic: C.
  Eye Safe Laser Target Designation Technology
NSWCDD has been tasked by ONR to investigate the viability of a high pulse rate / low energy laser designation and guidance capability.  The combination of many low energy pulses has several advantages.  First, the system can be more covert since integration of pulses is required to detect the laser.  Newer very high velocity projectiles that are being developed will require data rates that are substantially higher that todays lower pulse rate designators.  The lower energy per pulse requires the designator to develop less peak power, potentially decreasing the size and power requirements of the designator.  Finally, fewer pulses can be integrated at closer ranges to give an equivalent signal to noise ratio.
  Thus, the data rate can be increased upon closing on the target which yields higher data rates at closer ranges (where it is needed).

The development of this technology presents some technical challenges. First, narrow pulses are desired to increase the instantaneous signal to noise ratio.  This requirement drives the sample rate of the signal processor up.  Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) can handle the processing requirements but memory access to perform the pulse integration is a challenge.  Much like GPS, multiple correlators must be implemented to accommodate timing uncertainties.  Each correlator must have read/write access to high-speed memory.  Given the limited memory of the FPGA, a limited number of correlators can be implemented.

A second challenge is the clock stability required of the designator and seeker.
 Since multiple pulses must be integrated, any clock skew between the designator and seeker will cause the integrator to walk relative to the designator pulse and fail to correlate before the requisite number of pulses.  Consequently, there is a need for highly stable clocks for both the designator and seeker.

Topic: D. Laser Seeker/Sensors Technology
Given the engagements that are required in an urban environment, Class 4 lasers present a hazard to troops and civilians.  To reduce this hazard, it would be advantageous to switch from the current designation lasers to a 1550 nm designation laser. Unfortunately, there are several technical roadblocks.  First, while there are a plethora of detectors at 1550 nm, these detectors are small single detectors.
  Such small detectors limit the field of view of the seeker.  Due to advancements in gyro technology, newer systems are designed without gimbals (strapdown).  Consequently, even a larger field of view is required.  Current 1550 nm detectors are too small and have too high of a capacitance (affects noise and bandwidth).  There is a need for novel 1550 nm detector technologies and configurations to fill this need.

Topic:  E. Integrated Day/Night Sensors Technology
Prove the feasibility of an inexpensive single imaging sensor that provides day video, enhanced night video and the ability to view laser wavelengths of 860 nm, 1064 nm, and 1550 nm.  Current state of technology in FPA imaging systems has provided a number of technologies (silicon, InGaAs, HgCdTe, and CMOS imagers) that are sensitive to near infra-red energy, making many of them useful for detecting laser energy at 860 nm, 1064 nm, and 1550 nm.
  A single FPA with the ability to present day and night imagery superimposed with the image of the laser spot is desired.  There is also a need for extending night viewing ranges through the use of pulsed IR laser illumination gated imagery.  Reasonable technology cost is of key importance.  

Topic:  F. Optics Technology
Prove the feasibility of a lightweight miniaturized optical system capable of recognizing 1.4 x 1.7 m target at ranges up to 5km.  The optical technology would be coupled to day and night imaging systems and see-spot viewers for an indirect view capability.

Advances in sensor technologies have enabled the use of indirect view imaging for targeting applications.  This enables the use of novel technologies such as folded optical systems which allow for longer light path in a smaller package.
  Any improvement which reduces size and weight is encouraged.  Ideally, the design would have a single light path; however, designs which allow for multiple light paths may be necessary.

Topic: G. Laser Spot Imaging/Tracking and PRF Code Reading Technology
The currently fielded USMC Laser Target Designator (LTD) is the AN/PEQ-17, the Portable Lightweight Designator Rangefinder (PLDR).  The PLDR contains an integrated, although limited, Laser Spot Imaging (LSI) capability.  The integrated LSI relies on the user to select a combination of two filters that can be manually adjusted over the LSI camera aperture on the front of the system.  Even so, the available combinations of filters are not adequate to see the laser spot under all environmental and lighting conditions.

The AN/PAS-25, Thermal Laser Spot Imager (TLSI) is also currently fielded within the USMC.
  The TLSI is an approximately 8 lbs cooled mid wave thermal imager which is also sensitive to the 1.06 micron wavelength. 

The USMC is interested in technologies and materials which are able to reduce the size, weight, electrical power, and cost (both system and sustainment cost) of laser spot imagers.  Also of interest are ways of reducing cooling requirements and start-up (cool-down) times.  The USMC is also interested in LSI technologies which are able to read PRF codes and display the PRF number to the user.  The USMC is also interested in LSIs which are able to view laser spots at multiple wavelengths.  For example, the ability to view Class I eyesafe rangefinding lasers (typically 1550-1570), Class IV 1064 nm lasers, and IR Pointers (typically around 860 nm), would also be beneficial.

<DESC>Request for Information<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), Center for Health Care Contracting (CHCC), on behalf of the Department of the Army, has developed this Request for Information (RFI) to solicit market research information from industry to assist the Government with analysis of a Government requirement and provide commercial insight on performance-based solutions, best practices, possible contractual arrangements, and potential issues.<BR><BR>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a Solicitation, or an indication the CHCC will contract for the items contained in the RFI. This RFI is part of a Government market research effort to determine the scope of industry capabilities and interest and will be treated as information only. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responses to this RFI are strictly voluntary and the Government will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned and respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.  If a Solicitation is issued, it will be announced on the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fbo.gov at a later date, and all interested parties must respond to that Solicitation announcement separately from any response to this announcement.  This RFI does not restrict the Governments acquisition approach on a future Solicitation.<BR><BR>The U.S. Army  Medical Command (MEDCOM), Center for Health Care Contracting (CHCC), is conducting market research for  medical school support of The Army Trauma Training Center (ATTC). The ATTCs mission is to train Army Forward Surgical Teams (FST) for clinical and combat deployment.  The RFI is targeting U.S. medical schools with adjacent level 1 trauma centers to provide classroom facilities (a Resuscitative Skills Lab with six different stations, an Applied Physiology Lab for Mass Casualty Exercises, a Human Anatomy Lab, and an Extremity Lab), equipment, meals and physician teaching personnel to Army teams of approximately 25-30 individuals.  The program currently trains twelve forward surgical teams annually for a rotation of 14 days.  The MEDCOM currently operates and functions with civilian facilities to provide the function and clinical capacity of the Army healthcare service personnel in the trauma centers.  The purpose of the training center is to place the FSTs in a clinical setting that has one of the highest percentages of penetrating traumas, as well as blunt traumas, and a population at risk in the millions.  The government requests that the facility be a Level 1 civilian trauma center.  The FSTs operate with little to no support or interference from the civilian staff to ensure that they are working together as a team, as they will once they are deployed to support the overseas contingency operations.  The first week of training includes didactics on clinical skills, skills labs, simulation training, mock trauma, hands-on anatomy course, combat war extremity course, and a MASCAL exercise.  The second week consists of clinical rotations in the trauma resuscitation unit where the FST will split into two teams and work 12hr shifts.  The goal is for the FST to receive minimal assistance and/or interference from the civilian staff.  All of the training that the Soldiers receive culminates into the CAPSTONE event where the FST assumes 100% control of the trauma resuscitation unit for a 24hour operation with absolutely no assistance and/or interference from the civilian staff.<BR><BR>The government also requests that the contractor provide facilities, personnel, equipment, and supplies to contribute the ATTC training and daily functioning.  This includes but is not limited to office space for 13 Army Trauma Training Center staff; storage space for all of ATTCs equipment and supplies; lab space for eight skills labs: cadaver labs, applied physiology labs, anatomic exposure labs, and extremity labs; and classroom space to conduct didactic training.  The ATTC staff will reside in the facility as a permanent duty assignment to conduct not only the training rotations, but also to conduct the day-to-day operations of the unit.         <BR><BR>Respondents to this RFI should describe their interest and ability to perform the requirements summarized within this notice.  Responses should contain Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Phone Number, Fax Number, CAGE Code, Size of Business pursuant to NAICS 611310 and 531120, and GSA contract number, if any.  Responses should address the companys experience in providing similar services to medical facilities including commercial, military, or other federal Government hospitals and treatment facilities.  When describing this past experience, a brief description of the size, scope, and complexity of the requirement and the contracting vehicle should be provided.  Responses should also include a synopsis of companys facilities, trauma capability, educational resources, etc.  Reponses should be e mailed to the points of contact identified in the below section.  Responses should be formatted as either MS Word (.doc), (.docx), or Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf) and should be limited to a maximum of ten (10) pages.  Proprietary/Competition Sensitive information (appropriately marked) will be protected from disclosure to the greatest extent practical; however, it is preferred that respondents do not provide proprietary or otherwise restricted responses.  Responses should be submitted no later than 3:00 PM CST, December 3, 2010.  The Points of Contact are Mr. Gary Hankins, Gary.Hankins@amedd.army.mil, (210)221-3876 and Ms. Shirley Tolbert,  Shirley.Tolbert@amedd.army,mil, (210)295-4392.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

VISN 20, VA NW Healthcare System, South Branch Contracting, Vancouver WA, 98662 intends to award a single source Firm Fixed Price contract and will utilize procedures under FAR Part 13.106(b)(1), with S. Brooks & Associates Inc. 1130 NE Alberta St. Portland, OR  97211 as the only source reasonably available per 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) & FAR 6.302-1 & VAR 806.3 capable of providing the recently retired full time employee that performed the function of Emergency Room(ED) Bed Control Assistant. This person was previously employed as a FTE VA employee who recently separated from Federal Service. It is essential to retain the experience of this employee as a temporary contracted staff member through September 30, 2011 for continuity of services and decrease the workload until a new FTE can be hired and trained. Currently there is a hiring freeze for this position and it is vital to the operations of the Emergency Room Department to retain the experience and provide a capable, trained person to fill it to reduce the current staff workload and not create an overtime situation. 

Per (IL) 049-07-08, S Brooks & Associates Inc. is a VOSB vendor and contracting with them for the services of the Temporary Assistant meets the spirit of the Veterans First Contracting Program and realizes the lowest cost and thus makes this procurement in the best interest of the VA.

This notice of intent is not a request for proposals or quotations. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether conducting a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government in the future. Interested parties may identify their capabilities by responding to this requirement and considered for future reference. All information submitted should support the capability to provide the items required, and shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. Responses must be in writing and must provide clear and concise documentation indicating a bona fide capability to provide these items. Responses may be submitted via email to Darren.campbell2@va.gov.

<DESC>U.S. Agency for International Development's Office of Food for Peace (FFP) provides grants for food assistance to private voluntary organizations (PVOs) and the UN World Food Program (WFP) under Title II of Public Law 480. In fiscal year (FY) 2009 FFP provided more than 2.4 million metric tons of food, valued at more than $2.3 billion, worldwide. FFP provides both emergency food aid (which aims to address food aid needs arising from natural disasters, such as floods or droughts, and complex emergencies often characterized by insecurity and population displacement) and non-emergency food aid (which aims to address the underlying causes of chronic food insecurity). A recent U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) report on International Food Assistance (September 2009) noted that effective monitoring and evaluation of nonemergency food aid is critical for ensuring that FFP meets its strategic objective; and recommended that FFP strengthen its monitoring and evaluation activities. The report particularly noted the need to strengthen evaluation activities by providing "skilled evaluators" who can support the capacity of Mission FFP staff and implementing partners to carry out program evaluations.
<p>Title II food aid grants are signed by the Director of FFP in Washington, and the FFP/Washington Country Backstop Officer is usually the Agreement Officer's Technical Representative (AOTR) who is responsible for the technical and financial oversight of the grants. The USAID Mission has overall responsibility for monitoring the implementation of food assistance programs in the country.</p>
<p>To help support USAID Missions and FFP/Washington to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of Title II food aid programs, USAID/Pretoria Regional Food for Peace office requires the services of a FFP M&amp;E Specialist. . The position is based in Pretoria, South Africa but the FFP Officer is expected to spend approximately seventy (70) percent of his/her time traveling throughout the Southern Africa region and selected countries as needed.</p>
<p>The FFP M&amp;E Specialist will support the effective management of FFP resources by evaluating Title II non-emergency food aid programs, including using relevant data to help inform decision making, and provide technical assistance and training in the development and implementation of Title II M&amp;E systems for Title II non-emergency food aid programs</p>

A quote that is unrealistic in terms of technical quality or price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the contractual requirements.  Such quotes may be determined unacceptable.  Award will be made to the lowest-price, technically-acceptable offeror.  Award will be made to the offeror that presents the quote that possesses all of the following characteristics:  <BR>(1) meets the acceptability standards,<BR>(2) conforms to the solicitation,<BR>(3) determined acceptable to the Government,<BR>(4) is from a responsible (as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 9) offeror,<BR>and (5) has the lowest price of those offerors meeting the first four characteristics listed here.  <BR><BR>Except for communications conducted for the purpose of minor clarification, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions.  Therefore, each initial offer shall contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  <BR><BR>TECHNICAL EVALUATION STANDARDS:<BR><BR>(1) Acceptable - A proposal that satisfies all of the Governments requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Governments requirements.  <BR><BR>(2)  Unacceptable  A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk~ and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>4.

<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals so deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation technical capability and past performance are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit proposals that will be considered by the agency. Proposals must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Proposal. Proposals must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number. Proposals must be received no later than 8 DEC 2010, 11:00 A.M. Local California time.

<p><br />OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>This requirement is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center has a requirement for:

CLOTHING RENTAL AND CLEANING.   (SEE ATTACHED SOLICITATION M33610-11-T-0003 WITH SCOPE OF WORK INCLUDED)

Period of performance: 01 December 2010 to 30 November 2011 and 4 option years.



This combined synopsis/solicitation incorporates the provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-27.
 This is a 100% small-business set-aside. The NAICS Code for this requirement is 812332 with a size standard of 13 mil.

The contract resulting from this combined synopsis, solicitation, will be a firm-fixed price contract. 

DELIVERY/SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS: Prices shall be FOB destination, delivery to Mountain Warfare Training Center (MWTC) ATTN: SWRFT  HC 83, Box 1 BLDG 7047 Bridgeport, CA 93517-5009. Required  period of performance is: 01 December 2010  30 November 2011.

PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS: Preservation and Packaging shall be best commercial practice, sufficient to protect and preserve all items supplied under this contract during shipping to destination.

EVALUATION PROCEDURES/BASIS FOR AWARD The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract using FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).
 An LPTA evaluation will be performed for all clins. Only one (1) award may be made to the responsible quoter(s) who:1) quotes the service required specified in the combined synopsis/solicitation, conforming to the delivery requirement and; 2) quotes the lowest evaluated price. Information submitted by the offeror must sufficient to establish that the quoter is proposing the brand name items specified above. Quoters are not required to submit quotations for all CLINs. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without discussions with quoters. Quotations should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.
 

Quoters are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/ Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal. All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Quotations received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.
 With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire.
 The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

<p>&nbsp;<strong>52.212-2</strong> <strong>EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br /></strong>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) Technical capability of the service offered to meet the Government requirement <br />(ii) Past Performance<br />(iii) Price</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>In accordance with the FAR 13.106-1(a)(2), Soliciting Competition, Offerors are notified that award will be made on the basis of best value. Proposals received in response to subject request for proposal (RFP) shall be evaluated for technical acceptability and best value. Technically acceptable offers must meet all minimum specifications but offers which exceed the minimums may be rated more favorably. However, the Government will not pay an unreasonable amount for additional technical capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price. Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price. Notwithstanding that technical capability is more important than price, should all offers appear equal, price will become the determining factor in the award decision.</p>
<p><strong>52.216-1 TYPE OF CONTRACT (APR 1984)<br /></strong>The Government contemplates award of a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Firm Fixed Price</span></strong> contract resulting from this solicitation.</p>

These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed <strong>6</strong> months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within <strong>60 DAYS</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>52.217-9 OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000)<br /></strong>(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 DAYS; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 DAYS before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.<br />(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.<br />(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed <strong>(5) FIVE YEARS AND (6) SIX MONTHS</strong>.</p>

<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)<br />(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.</p>
<p>(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).</p>
<p>(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.</p>
<p>(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.</p>
<p>(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.</p>
<p>(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>RRB Specialty MAC (Part B) Pre-solicitation Notice:
<p>As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), RRB, as authorized under paragraph 1842(b)(1) of the Social Security Act, must solicit and compete its Part B Medicare Administrative Contractor (Specialty MAC) contracts every five (5) years. The purpose of this contract is to obtain a Specialty MAC (hereinafter, referred to as "the Contractor") to provide specified health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare FFS program. The Contractor shall perform its responsibilities under the direction of RRB in concert with Medicare Program direction from CMS.</p>
<p>The Contractor will perform numerous functions to support health care services for Medicare beneficiaries, which include performing claims-related activities and establishing relationships with professional providers of health care services, for a nationwide "jurisdiction." The Contractor will perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals, and CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare program. The Medicare program's legal, policy, and operating environment is complex, and the Contractor will utilize or interact with certain CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment, and operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor will coordinate its activities not only with RRB and CMS, but also with a broad range of agencies (at the federal, state, and local levels of government), other CMS partners and Contractors, and a diverse range of stakeholders within the health care system of the United States.</p>
<p>In accordance with RRB's technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from professional providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction and will perform standard or required editing on these claims to determine whether the claims are complete and should be paid. An edit is defined as "logic within the Standard Claims Processing System that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review."</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor calculates Medicare payment amounts and remits these payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor may also conduct redeterminations on appeals of claims; operate a Beneficiary and Provider Customer Service Program (BPCSP) that educates providers and beneficiaries about the Medicare program and responds to provider and beneficiary telephone and written inquiries and make compability of payment&nbsp;decisions nationwide. The Contractor also will conduct a variety of different provider services, such as&nbsp;answering written and telephone inquiries, and educating providers on Medicare's rules, regulations, and billing procedures.</p>
<p>RRB anticipates releasing a solicitation for this nationwide jurisdiction on or about DECEMBER 8, 2010. The contract will include a base year plus four one-year options. The anticipated proposal due date is JANUARY&nbsp;18, 2011 with an anticipated award date of June 1, 2011.</p>
<p>This solicitation is expected to be issued as pending availability of funds.</p>

<DESC><p>Q (64) The "Is Extended" box in Block 11 is checked however the due date shown in this block has not changed. Is the due date extended?</p>
<p>A (64) The due date is currently 3 Dec 2010 4:00PM unless extended via a new amendment.</p>
<p>Q (65) Volume IV now consists of a single page (Attachment G). Would the government consider including Attachment G as part of Volume I?<br /><br />A (65) No, the Government will not consider including attachment G as part of Volume I.<br /><br />Q (66) Paragraphs 12, 13 and 14 on pages 8 and 9 of Amendment 0005 appear to delete all option periods. Will the resulting contract be a one year effort with no potential for award of option years?</p>
<p>A (66) The resulting contract will be a one year effort with no potential for award of options. This is due to the Letter of Offer and Acceptance agreements between the United States Government and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia not supporting a five (5) year period of performance.</p>
<p>Q (67)</p>
<p>Based on the answer to question 21, should our team resubmit the our Volume III since we only printed our FACTS Sheets on one side and therefore there are a total of 4 pages for each reference? Additionally, please advise if the all volume submittals should be printed on both sides.</p>
<p>Q (21) On page 49 of the Solicitation paragraph D Volume III - Present and Past Performance it states that "The offeror may expand the answering space on the FACTS Sheet so that the filled-in FACTS Sheet for each relevant contract covers no more than both sides of two 8 &frac12; x 11 inch pages." Does our response need to be printed on both sides of the paper? Is there a page limit for each individual Past Performance Fact Sheet?</p>
<p>A (21) Yes, the response needs to be printed on both sides of the paper and yes, there's a page limit (both sides of two pages).</p>
<p>A (67) Yes, Volume III should be resubmitted per answer A (21). Only in Volume III per paragraph D (2) in section L is printing instructions detailed to no more than both sides of two pages: "The offeror may expand the answering space on the FACTS Sheet so that the filled-in FACTS Sheet for each relevant contract covers no more than both sides of two 8 &frac12; x 11 inch pages."</p>

<DESC>Due to&nbsp;a system crash of one of the government's computers, some email received from November 12 through the 16 was lost when the computer was rebuilt.&nbsp; As a result of this lost data, the government is providing an extension until Friday, December 3, 2010 to submit a capability statement in accordance with the announcement below. If you previously responded to this announcement, you should resend your response to ensure that it was received by the government so that it can be reviewed and considered.<br />&nbsp; <br /><br />This is NOT a solicitation announcement. This is a Sources Sought Notice only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is for market research purposes to determine if capable, businesses (large businesses or small businesses which include service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), women-owned small business (WOSB) historically underutilized business zone (HUBZone) businesses, 8(a) firms, small disadvantaged business (SDB) relative to North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) code 541990 (size standard in gross annual receipts of income as defined in 13 CFR 121.104) ) possess the capability to support National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to provide scientific studies related to NOAA's mission. Responses to this sources sought notice shall not constitute responses to any solicitation, which is not currently available. As stipulated in FAR 5.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's evaluation of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a small business set-aside, full and open competition, or sole-source procurement.<br /><br />NOAA is a federal agency within the Department of Commerce that is focused on the condition of the oceans and the atmosphere. The NOAA mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth's environment and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our nation's economic, social and environmental needs. As a supplier of environmental information products, NOAA provides the nation with information that pertains to the state of the oceans and the atmosphere. This is clearly manifest in the production of weather warnings and forecasts through the National Weather Service, but NOAA's information products extend to climate, ecosystems and commerce as well. NOAA serves as the steward of national coastal and marine environments. In coordination with federal, state, local, tribal and international authorities, NOAA manages the use of these environments, regulating fisheries and marine sanctuaries as well as protecting threatened and endangered marine species.<br /><br />NOAA is a trusted source of accurate and objective scientific information in four particular areas of national and global importance which constitute its long-term mission critical and strategic goals:<br />&bull; Ecosystems: Ensure the sustainable use of resources and balance competing uses of coastal and marine ecosystems, recognizing both their human and natural components. <br />&bull; Climate: Understand changes in climate, including the El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon, to ensure that we can plan and respond properly. <br />&bull; Weather &amp; Water: Provide data and forecasts for weather and water cycle events, including storms, droughts and floods. <br />&bull; Commerce &amp; Transportation: Provide weather, climate, and ecosystem information to make sure individual and commercial transportation is safe, efficient and environmentally sound.
<p><br />To assist it in framing its long-term strategic course, NOAA requires input in many complex and interrelated scientific and technical topics. This requires an understanding of the current state of science as well as an intimate knowledge of newly emerging scientific and technical methodologies to support recommendations for future directions NOAA should take into consideration while laying out its strategic plan to meet its mission goals.<br /><br />The government needs to acquire independent scientific, technical, and policy guidance from scientists and others in a variety of environmental and public policy issues through the conduct of scientific studies which result in compilation of written reports by an institution that has been formally chartered by the U.S. Congress to provide independent scientific advice to the Congress and federal agencies.<br /><br />Areas to be investigated through studies, but are not limited to, the following areas of interest:<br />&bull; Integrated Observing and Data Management System<br />&bull; Assessments and Forecasts of Coastal and Marine Ecosystems<br />&bull; Scenario Development to Support Specific Management Actions and Decisions<br />&bull; Exploring Unknown and Little Known Areas of Earth's Oceans<br />&bull; Capacity Building and Effective Knowledge Transfer<br />&bull; Integrated Global Observation and Data System<br />&bull; Documenting and Understanding Changes in Climate Forcings and Feedbacks<br />&bull; Improving Climate Predictions and Projections<br />&bull; Understanding Impacts of Climate Variability and Change on Marine Ecosystems<br />&bull; Enhancing NOAA's Operational Decision Support Tools<br />&bull; Improving Weather Forecasts and Warnings<br />&bull; Water Resources Forecasting<br />&bull; Providing Information to Air Quality Decision Makers and Establishing and Improving a National Air Quality Forecast Capability<br />&bull; Improving Understanding and Forecast Capability in Coasts, Estuaries, and Oceans<br />&bull; Reduced Risks to Life, Health, and Property<br />&bull; Issues that Slow or Stop Movement of Goods<br />&bull; Reduced Risks and Adverse Environmental Impacts<br />&bull; Security</p>
<p>Firms that believe that they have the necessary expertise and capacity to provide these studies may submit a capability statement or proposal which shall be considered by the agency. The capability statement shall be no more than twenty (20) single-sided pages in length and shall address the following topics:<br />&bull; Organization's Name, Address, Phone Number, Email, and Point of Contact Information<br />&bull; Brief summary describing your organization and purpose. If you are an educational institution, list any specific areas of study (e.g. - degree programs, emphasis programs).<br />&bull; Provide a list of experience and studies in topics that are similar to the above. Discuss how scientific experts and qualified scientists are selected to conduct these studies. Discuss how you would incorporate a wide range of views to give a spectrum of scientific thought in a subject area. If studies were conducted on behalf of the government, list department and agency along with a point of contact name, number, and email address.<br />&bull; List experience/education/certifications of any key personnel relevant to the studies above completed in the past five (5) years. Copies of resumes and a list of relevant papers published should be included. The list should provide at a minimum, the author, name of the study, publication, and date with a synopsis of the study.<br />&bull; Credibility, impartiality, and objectivity of the study by your institution. Since these reports impact environmental and agency policy, your organization should discuss how you will ensure credibility, impartiality, and objectivity in any studies that could be conducted by your organization. In order to maintain this credibility, impartiality, and objectivity, indicate any financial interests that might relate to the studies listed above and provide an explanation of how you would mitigate any potential risk associated with those financial interests. <br />&bull; Include your business size classification (e.g. large business, small business, 8(a), HUBZone, SDB, SDVOSB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.)</p>
<p>Submissions will not be accepted after Friday, December 3, 2010, Close of Business. Electronic responses are required and shall be submitted to Joan Clarkston at joan.e.clarkston@noaa.gov. All documentation shall become the property of the Government. Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract.</p>

(LMSTS) Orlando, FL for support services (including maintenance) for government owned Consolidated Automated Support Systems (CASS) Offload Operational Test Program Sets (OTPS). The requirement will be for support services for CASS testers/stations located throughout the world (both foreign and domestic). The following CASS Offload OTPS' shall be included under the IPBL: RADCOM E-2C, RADCOM EA-6B, RADCOM SH-60, CATIIID EA-6B, CATIIID E-2C, NEWTS, DTB EA-6B, TMV SH-60, HTS SH-60, HTS EA-6B, and HTS F/A-18.

The Government intends to negotiate this extended (1) year POP, Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract for Interim PBL under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. OTPSs are still being delivered, therefore, the Government does not own all of the necessary data to permit full and open competition. Lockheed Martin STS is the designer, developer, and Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the OTPS' and is the only known source to have sufficient technical data, drawings, software, repair parts, and trained technical staff to maintain the OTPS. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all responses received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitations will be available for this procurement.

<DESC>This amendment to the Sources Sought Notice chages the NAICS Code to 541620.  The original NAICS Code was entered erroneously.  The following text has been revised to reflect this change.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Acquisition Management (EPA/OAM) is conducting market research (for informational purposes only) to identify potential small business sources (including 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns) with the capacity and technical capability necessary to successfully perform the requirements described herein.     
The subject requirement will provide laboratory assay and related scientific technical support for EPA Office of Science Coordination and Policy (OSCP).  These services are currently provided by the incumbents, Eastern Research Group, Inc. (ERG), Research Triangle Institute (RTI), and Battelle Memorial Institute, under EPA contracts EPW06025, EPW06026, and EPW06032, respectively.    Notwithstanding the Governments option to exercise term extensions, the current contracts are scheduled to expire April/May 2011.  
The proposed acquisition is valued at approximately $25 million, including all options.  The Government anticipates awarding as a five year Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) labor-hour contract, in accordance with the procedures under FAR Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services.  The small business size standard for this NAICS category is $7.0 million in annual receipts (or income) as defined under 13 CFR ? 121.104.  
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSALS. This is a sources sought notice for written information only.  The purpose of this notice is to invite interested small business concerns to submit a brief capability statement, delineating a business approach for meeting the requirements in the draft Statement of Work (SOW).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or reimburse the costs incurred by potential offerors in providing the information requested herein. 
Capability statements must address technical competencies, and management/personnel experience relative to: (1) the key task areas in the draft SOW; and (2) the overall business demands of the proposed acquisition for the best mix of cost, performance, and schedules.  In addition, capability statements must address the concern?s capacity to manage the anticipated volume of work for this requirement.  Finally, general financial and organizational information should be provided with regard to the following items: (1) average number of employees of the concern; (2) average annual receipts based on the last 3 fiscal years; and (3) a description of other current business commitments (i.e., contracts, etc.). 
Interested parties should be concise in their capability statements, and limit responses to no more than 15 pages.  Capability statements should be responsive to all information items requested herein to allow for an accurate business assessment.  Standard brochures and paraphrasing of the Statement of Work (SOW) will not be considered a sufficient response to this notice.  Feedback and/or evaluation information will not be provided to any firm regarding their individual capability statements; and no telephone calls and/or requests for a solicitation will be accepted or acknowledged.  All responses should be sent via email to martiyan.stefan@epa.gov and bushta.dennisjames@epa.gov.  The deadline for submitting capability statements is December 30, 2010, 3:00 PM, ET. 
Additional information for this requirement, including a draft Statement of Work (SOW), will be available at the following website approximately five business days after issuance of this notice: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/1110235/index.htm

<p>Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.</p>
<p>Any information taken from other publications is used at the sole risk of the offeror. The procuring office cannot guarantee the accuracy of information contained in other publications.</p>
<p>All questions must be submitted in writing to the attention of Mr. Jay Oxenberg either by email: jay.oxenberg@gsa.gov or by fax: 215-873-8428.</p>

<DESC>The Picayune Strand Restoration Project, Faka Union Pump Station, Levees, Canals and Roads (referred to Project), is part of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP).

<DESC>This synopsis is notification of the Fort Carson Contracting Office intent to sole source a contract modification to the existing contractor, Mark Dunning Industries, Inc., to extend the period of performance for a contract which is a indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract with a 1 year base performance period, plus four one-year option periods. The contract is currently in a two month extension that runs from 29 September 2010 through 30 October 2010 through 30 November 2010. The extension will be for an additional three months to the incumbent contractor Mark Dunning Industries, Inc., 100 Race Track Road, Dothan, AL 36303. The extension will provide uninterrupted services to the Fort Carson installation. The contract is a firm fixed price contract. This action is intended to be accomplished under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).The extension modification must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order. <br/><br/>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that an alternate approach would be advantageous to the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written comments to this notice and detailed capabilities must be emailed to Crystal Price at crystal.l.price@us.army.mil by 24 November 2010 16:00/4:00pm Mountain time.

<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />IN ACCORDANCE WITH TITLE 41, U.S.C. 253(c)(1)</p>
<p>8 November 2010</p>
<p>1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:<br />The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Human Resources Division, FBIHQ, Washington, DC., is the customer for this acquisition. The Contracting Activity will be the Operational Support Contracts Unit, FBI, Chantilly, Va.</p>
<p>2. DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:<br />The Human Resources Division (HRD) has requested a sole source blanket purchase agreement for one base year ($80,000.00) and four one year option periods (to be determined on a yearly basis) for the purchase of pre-dosed approved travel medications to be used by FBI employees when traveling to overseas locations.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED:<br />HRD requires several different types of medications for employees that are traveling overseas. Employees may need the following medications: Cipro, Doxy, Lariam (Mefloquine), Malarone, and Diamox. Furthermore HRD requires that the medication be in pre determined unit doses (UD). Below you will find more specific information of the medications, the amount in each tablet and the pre determined unit doses.</p>
<p>Ciproflaxcin will need to be 500mg tablets to be taken orally with a unit dose of 14.</p>
<p>Doxycycline will be 100mg tablets to be taken orally with unit doses of: 2, 7, 14, 20, 28, 30, and 60.</p>
<p>Lariam or Mefloquine will be 250mg tablets to be taken orally with unit doses of: 8 and 10.</p>
<p>Malarone will be 250/100mg tablets to be taken orally with unit doses of: 16 and 24.</p>
<p>Diamox will be 125mg tablets to be taken orally with a unit dose of 12.</p>
<p>All medications shall come pre-labeled with the prescribing physicians name printed on the bottle. Additionally the bottle shall come with a second label to be included in the patients file for records and tracking capability. The contractor shall also be responsible to keep all production information on all orders placed against the BPA should the need for it arise in the future. The contractor shall also have the ability to ship anywhere in the continental United States, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico under one account/purchase order number.</p>
<p>Since no other vendor other than Allscripts can meet these requirements a sole source award is the only way to proceed. Because of the above reasons the HRD feels that sole sourcing with Allscripts is the most cost effective and beneficial plan for the Government.</p>
<p>4. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN<br />COMPETITION:<br />The statutory authority for using Other Than Full and Open<br />Competition is Title 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>5. DEMONSTRATION THAT PROPOSED NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES<br />USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED:<br />HRD has solicited numerous vendors and have been unsuccessful is receiving qualifying offers back from any vendor other than Allscripts. HRD requires specific unit doses that many vendors will not meet and give minimums that would require HRD to order more than is needed which would lead to waste. Laws also prohibit HRD from buying anything but the prescribed dose as it is illegal for a non-pharmacy to buy larger doses and then redistribute them in smaller doses to patients.</p>
<p>HRD also requires that two labels be included with all orders. One label on the bottle with the prescribing physicians name already printed on the label. The second label to be included will be used in the medical file of the receiving patient for record keeping. Currently Allscripts is the only vendor that is capable of providing HRD with the labels.</p>
<p>Allscripts is the only vendor that offers a tracking system of everything that has been ordered by the FBI. This information is critical in case of damage or theft to existing records. It is also critical to know who made each batch of medication as well as where it was made in case any unforeseen complications arise.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT AS MANY POTENTIAL<br />SOURCES AS PRACTICABLE ARE SOLICITED:<br />HRD solicited 3 different vendors for quotes for the requirements stated above. The documentation of this has been included in the contract file for further detail. The contracting officer went through several vendors on GSA and was unable to find a vendor that could offer all of the required medications on one GSA contract. A notice will be publicized at www. fedbizopps.gov for this sole source acquisition as required by FAR Subpart 5.2.</p>
<p>7. COST ANALYSIS:<br />A cost/price analysis has been conducted by the Contracting Officer (CO). Based upon the cost/price analysis, the CO has determined that the cost/price to the Government is fair and reasonable. In addition, it was determined that this sole source purchase was the most cost effective manner of addressing the requiring activity's requirements.</p>
<p>8. MARKET RESEARCH:<br />HRD and the contracting officer have conducted market research in two different ways. First HRD solicited 3 different vendors for quotes for the requirements stated above. The documentation of this has been included in the contract file for further detail. The contracting officer went through several vendors on GSA and was unable to find a vendor that could offer all of the required medications on one GSA contract.</p>
<p>9. OTHER FACTORS:</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>10. LISTING OF THE SOURCES THAT EXPRESSED A WRITTEN INTEREST IN<br />THE ACQUISITION:</p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p>11. ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE/OVERCOME BARRIERS TO COMPETITION:<br />HRD will continue to review available vendors and gather information on potential vendors and medications to be used in the future.</p>
<p>12. CERTIFICATIONS:<br />TECHNICAL SPECIALIST CERTIFICATION:<br />As the Technical Representative of this requirement, I hereby certify that all information contained herein is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge.</p>
