FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 10 - 250 - Dayton, OH is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>This solicitation is a non-set-aside requirement, however, the CO may use socioeconomic status as an evaluation factor. <BR> <BR>This is a Best Value Procurement. This award will be made to the responsible Seller whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to Buyer on the basis of technical capability, past performance, delivery, and price. Technical capacity is more important than past performance. Past Performance is more important than delivery. Delivery is more important than price. <BR> <BR>Sellers certify that they are an Authorized Channel or Reseller as of the date of submission of bid, and that they have the authorization required to support the product sale, product pricing, and product warranties in accordance with applicable manufacturer authorization requirements. Unless otherwise specified, Sellers warrant that the products are new and in their original packaging and the OEM warranties remain in full effect.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.    (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.    (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use.

Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.    (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices.

It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.    (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches. <BR> <BR>The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF CONDUCTING MARKET RESEARCH. <br>  <br> This is a sources sought announcement only for the purposes of conducting market research in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. There is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB) and does not serve to bind the U.S. Government in any way. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov for the release of any follow-on information. The Government will not reimburse any concern for any information that is submitted in response to this sources sought request. Any information submitted is voluntary. The MICC Fort Stewart Contracting Office intends to issue a three (3) to six (6) month bridge contract to the incumbent contractor for Dinning Facilities Attendant Services on Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia. The bridge contract period will begin 1 October 2013. While budget cuts may affect the longevity of this requirement and the need beyond the six (6) month extension, this announcement is issued to determine the extent to which small businesses are capable of performing as the prime contractor for all labor, personnel, equipment, materials, supplies, supervision and other items and services necessary to provide Dinning Facilities Attendant Services located on Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield.   The work to be performed requires the contractor to provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to provide Dining Facility Attendant (DFA) service across twelve (12) dining facilities located on Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield; with approximately 67 meal periods per month (breakfast, lunch, dinner during the week and brunch, dinner during weekends) with a rough average headcount of 250 per meal. These dining facilities are not normally all operated simultaneously but are opened and closed based on the needs of the installations. The bridge contract will allow for sufficient time to compete the follow-on requirement which will be posted on the FBO website. <br>  <br> This work is performed under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 722310. The small business size standard for this NAICS is $35.5 million average annual revenue for the last three fiscal years. Work under this requirement shall provide the management, administration, supplies, materials and labor necessary to perform the required services. Interested sources must submit technical capabilities and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the Government's needs. Responses must be received no later than 5:00 p.m. EST, Thursday, September 26, 2013 by email to Brett Zeigler, derrick.b.zeigler.civ@mail.mil and Jimmy Frye, james.r.frye20.civ@mail.mil. No solicitation will be released for competition from this announcement, and no reimbursement will be made for any cost associated with providing information in response to this announcement. No contract will be awarded on a basis of offers received in response to this notice, but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government. No solicitation document is available and telephones requests for technical information will not be honored.

<DESC>Presidio of Monterey Garrison (POM) Base Operation Support Services (BASOPS) Notice of Intent <br>   <br> This is a NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT.  The Mission and Installation Contracting Command - Fort Sam Houston Contracting Office on behalf of the Presidio of Monterey Garrison (POM) intends to negotiate and award a logical follow-on to an original POM BASOPS contract W9124N-12-D-0001.  Authority cited is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  This order will be issued to the Presidio Municipal Services Agency (PMSA), a Joint Powers Agency between the City of Monterey and the City of Seaside, California in order to provide continuum services in support of the POM Garrison in Monterey, CA; Defense Language Institute (DLI) in Monterey, CA; Ord Military Community (OMC) in Seaside, CA; Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) in Seaside, CA; and Camp Roberts Satellite Communications Office (SATCOM) in Monterey County, CA.  The work includes all services necessary to operate, maintain, inspect, and repair real property facilities at POM, OMC, DMDC and SATCOM.  The contractor provides materials, supplies, tools, supervision, labor, transportation, equipment, facilities (except those specified as Government-furnished) and any other items necessary to provide these services. The contractor provides support in key functional areas including all operations, maintenance, repair and associated support services requirements for the following: (1) Water Lateral System Maintenance; (2) Wastewater Lateral System Maintenance; (3) Storm Water Collection and Drainage System Maintenance; (4) Street and Surfaced Area Maintenance; (5) Fire Alarms Operation and Maintenance; (6) Fire Sprinkler Systems Maintenance; (7) Elevator Maintenance; (8) Fencing System Maintenance; (9) Building, Structure and Facility Maintenance; (10) Air Conditioning Maintenance; (11) Generator Maintenance; and (12) Other Municipal Services.   <br>  <br> Presidio Municipal Services Agency has been the sole source contractor performing the services under the authority of Public Law 108-136 (24 November 2003) (National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004)and has the necessary knowledge, experience, and staff to maintain services currently performed under contract W9124N-12-D-0001. A short-term contract is required to bridge the gap between the current requirement for continued BASOPS at the POM starting 1 December 2013, and the future implementation of the Intergovernmental Support Agreement (IGSA) under FY 2013 NDAA Section 331 authority.   No source other than the incumbent can satisfy this short-term need given the transition period that would be required, and conducting a follow-on acquisition for this need would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  For the reasons noted above, MICC-FSH intends to award a short-term logical follow-on contract to PMSA to ensure that the POM is able to meet its mission without any lapse in services while it completes necessary actions for the follow-on IGSA. <br>  <br> This action will result in a no-fee cost reimbursement contract.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 561210, Base Facilities Operation Support Services, with a size standard of $35.5M.   <br>  <br> THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL and no solicitation will be issued.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of responses received to this notice. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting the POM's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received by 27 Sep 13, 4 pm CST, will be considered. The government does not intend to pay for information provided by an agency. All questions and/or responses must be directed to Maria Cachola via email at maria.d.cachola.civ@mail.mil.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.   <br>

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527; Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875.

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest directly with the Contracting Officer responsible for this acquisition should review the procedures at FAR Part 33 and send your protest to LTC Warren Seymour, at warren.g.seymour.mil@mail.mil . Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527; Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875.

FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 22 - 600 - Long Beach Healthcare System is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid.
