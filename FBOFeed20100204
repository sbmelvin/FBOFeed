<DESC>DESCRIPTION:
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Information Directorate has a requirement for an integrated software solution that improves upon the targeting functionality currently performed by Air Force (AF) and joint targeting automation software.</p>
<p>The successful software approach will: (1) advance the current software functionality towards full automation of all needed targeting capabilities, including support to all elements of the joint targeting cycle and to time-critical and time-sensitive targeting operations; (2) improve software performance; (3) be more responsive to operational needs; and (4) as required, incorporate new versions of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and newly developed (Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS)) software.</p>
<p>Successful software delivery will require the successful offeror to: (1) participate in integration testing with various operating environments (Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS), to include Global Command and Control System - Integrated Intelligence and Imagery (GCCS-I3), GCCS-Joint (GCCS-J), GCCS-Joint Digital Intelligence Support System (GCCS-JDISS), GCCS-Maritime (GCCS-M), GCCS-Air Force (GCCS-AF), Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB), etc.); and (2) respond quickly to user mission needs concerning the integration, training, initialization, operation, and management of the delivered suite of applications. While meeting the needs of the targeting community-at-large, customer-specific capabilities must be provided and interoperability with legacy and evolving systems, data bases and architectures must be maintained.</p>
<p>Anticipated deliverables include computer software and technical documentation. An Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) - Supply contract is contemplated. Both Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) orders will be issued under this contract. The total ordering period for this contract will be sixty (60) months and the acquiring agency anticipates that approximately $49.9 million will be sufficient to cover orders for the duration of the ordering period.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541511. The small business size standard for this code is $25 million in annual receipts.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the small business capability packages received in response to the previous Sources Sought notice resulted in a determination that a small business set-aside was not appropriate. The successful offeror will be selected as a result of full and open competition.</p>
<p>Foreign participation is excluded at the prime contractor level.</p>
<p>All information generated or maintained under this effort is export controlled. Therefore, prospective offerors must provide a completed and approved DD Form 2345 which certifies the offeror is on the Certified Contractors Access List (CCAL) or that the offeror is seeking application to CCAL. For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistics Information Service at (877) 352-2255 or on the web at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/. It is solely the responsibility of the contractor to obtain an export license from the U. S. Department of State and to comply with the federal laws and regulations. Questions concerning the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and export licensing must be directed to the U.S. Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and not the Air Force Project Engineer, Contracting Office, or Air Force Foreign Disclosure Office.</p>
<p>A technical library relating to the subject area of this acquisition is available for review by potential offerors at the Air Force Research Laboratory/RIEBC, Building 3, 525 Brooks Road, Rome New York 13441-4505.

Interested parties are advised that to perform this acquisition the successful offeror will be required to have at the time of award 3 personnel with Top Secret SCI clearances and 3 personnel with collateral clearances (total for the prime and all subcontractors).

<p>In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting with an Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer, Lori L. Anguilli, (315) 330-1955, Lori.Anguilli@rl.af.mil, for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (AUG 2005) will be incorporated into the resultant contract. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the Ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The Ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Consulting an Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, concerned parties may contact the following AFRL Ombudsman: Susan Hunter, Building 15, RM225, 1864 4th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7130 FAX: (937) 255-5036 COM: (937) 255-7754. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the AFRL level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force Ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.

Do not contact the Ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contract Specialist.</p>

Evaluation method will be Past Performance Price Tradeoff without Technical Proposals. Evaluation factors will be (a) technical - meets solicitation requirements (pass/fail); (b) past performance; and (c) price.  Past Performance and Price are of equal importance.  Offerors are requested to submit past performance no more than three years old for same or similar type contracts and for same or similar level of effort.  Initially offers shall be ranked according to price.  The past performance assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence as defined in MP5315.3, Table 3.  If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating and is determined to be responsible, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.  The government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance assessment rating of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.  The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.  A Subcontracting Plan is not required with this RFP.  
Description:  The fuel nozzles are welded assemblies that deliver carefully calibrated, precisely patterned fuel spray for combustion in a gas turbine engine.  The fuel nozzle consists of a cover or inlet, check valve, cartridge valve, support, and metering set.  Function:  The fuel nozzle assembly receives fuel through the inlet.  Fuel passes through the inlet strainer and accumulates in the portion of the support that houses the valves.  The primary flow passes through the primary strainer and is directed through the check valve.  It then passes through the inner tube of the support to the primary body of the metering set.  Fuel passes around the primary plug and through the primary body and enters the combustion chamber as a uniform density, cone shaped spray.  The cone of the secondary spray is wider than that of the primary and therefore surrounds the primary spray pattern.  Dimensions:  length is 7.06 inches, width is 3.00 inches, height is 3.00 inches, weight is 1.28 lbs.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to sole source by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA intends to modify purchase order number HHSF2232008521P awarded on 09/02/2008 to Assured Information Systems, LTD in the amount of $686,413.26.  The vendor is currently providing the Center of Veterinary Medicine (CVM), a software tool called PV-Works to support 12 primary and 6 secondary users. Due to increasing numbers of adverse events, FDA is seeking up to 60 additional licenses over the course of the next few years.  PV-Works is the only known software that tracks extensive data regarding veterinary pharmaceuticals and Assured Information Systems, LTD is the only known vendor that can provide the additional licenses. The vendor is located at Colmorth Business Park, St Neots, Cambridgeshire, UK PE 19 8YH.   

In accordance with FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2-b (2) the Government is contemplating an award on a sole source basis for the following reasons:

a) This requirement was previously publicized and competed on Federal Business Opportunities on 08/04/08, Combined Synopsis # FDA-SOL-08-1045418.  No other vendors replied and it was determined at that time, Assured Information Systems, LTD was the only company capable of providing extensive data validation of veterinary pharmaceuticals as needed by the Center of Veterinary Medicine (CVM).   

b) There is a current legitimate need for additional PV-Works licenses and associated technical support.  

c) There would be detrimental consequences to CVM's ability to protect the public if the licenses are not acquired.

The NAICS code is 541511.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes; no solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted.  However, sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capability to perform these services, which will be considered by the Agency.  A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A solicitation will be issued to Assured Systems, LTD (USA) Inc. no less than 15 days after the date of this notice unless the Government determines.  All written inquiries must be received via email no later than Wednesday February 17, 2010 at 2PM ET to the attention of Contract Specialist, Jody O'Kash at jody.o'kash@fda.hhs.gov.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for fire protective services to support NationalAeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC).  NASA/JSC intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to MEI Technologies, Inc. for anine month extension to contract NAS 9-03059.  This extension will be structured as nine,1-month contract options.  This extension will allow for the continuation of fireprotective services at NASA JSC from April 01, 2010 to December 31, 2010.The contracted effort encompasses Emergency Action Personnel and Emergency ActionResponses.  These services entail emergency action response at JSC that include:first-aid, fire-fighting activities, rescue activities, and other activities as necessaryto limit injury, death, environmental, or property damage.The primary work areas for this contract are aerospace facilities at the NASA JohnsonSpace Center, Houston, Texas; and related operations at Ellington Field (EF), Houston,Texas; and Sonny Carter Training Facility (SCTF) Houston, Texas.The authorities cited permitting other than full and open competition are 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1) and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1); only one responsible source and no other supplies orservices will satisfy agency requirements.  The Government does not believe thatcompeting this effort at this time is in its best interest, as the period of performancefor this extension is only nine, 1-month options.  The phase-in costs and time involvedin transitioning to a new contractor and establishing relationships with the variousaffected parties, for this short period, would far outweigh any cost savings achievedthrough competition.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon February 19, 2010.

<DESC><p>The objective is the ongoing development of caLIMS2. The initial focus of the contract will be on the development of the web-based application and user interface, with the revision of caLIMS2 components as needed. <br />As the scientific community begins to better understand cancer at the molecular level, and personalized medicine is implemented in cancer patient care, researchers and clinicians will require more rapid access to - and easier methods to analyze - the multiple types of information involved. To this end, the vision of caBIG&reg; is a full cycle of integrated cancer research, extending from bench to bedside, and back again. The need to capture relevant information includes tracking what happens to patient samples and data at the laboratory level. caBIG&reg; tools currently exist for Clinical Trials implementation and monitoring, biospecimen storage and tracking, data repository management, and data analysis. However caBIG&reg; lacks an application to track what happens to patient samples and data at the laboratory level. caLIMS2 will fill that gap to help complete the bench to bed model.</p>

<DESC>Contracting Office Address<br /> <br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National 	Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, 	Room 6072, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br />Description<br /><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), The Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB), plans to procure on a sole source basis with the University of Bolton, Dean Road, Bolton BL3 5AB, UK for a high-resolution NMR analysis of saliva and esophageal cells. <br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:  Performance shall be for twelve months.</p>
<p>NEB conducts intramural research in the areas of nutrition and cancer, genetics and cancer, and cancer prevention.  The NEB is currently examining the hypothesis that differences in saliva chemistry are associated with the different risks of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and other cancers.  The NEB plans to measure saliva and esophageal cell chemical analytes using high field proton high-resolution NMR analysis.  The purpose of this procurement is to obtain data on saliva and esophageal chemical composition and to test the effect of different methods of saliva collection, preservation, and analysis.</p>
<p>The Contractor requirements are as follows:<br />1.	The contractor shall complete high-resolution salivary 1H NMR analysis on 160 saliva samples; <br />2.	The contractor shall determine the reliability and reproducibility of multi-component 1H NMR metabolic data acquired on the saliva specimens; <br />3.	The contractor shall examine the utility of high-resolution 1H NMR analysis for frozen esophageal cells using 40 samples, to include cells analyzed by  1H magic angle spinning solid-state NMR and post-neutralized perchloric acid extracts analyzed by 1H NMR;<br />4.	The contractor shall conduct post-analytic data analysis including principal components analysis to detect outliers or unknown clusters and multilevel component analysis to assess variance due to differences in sampling or oral health indicators.</p>
<p>The current acquisition is based on the need to generate data on the chemical composition of saliva and esophageal cells using high-resolution 1H-1H TOCSY and COSY NMR spectra for saliva and the use of  magic angle spinning solid state NMR on intact esophageal cells to aid in our investigations of the link between oral health and upper gastrointestinal cancer etiology.  These methods offer numerous advantages over competing methods including flexible input samples collection methods and minimal sample processing.  The NMR analytic method requires essentially no prior knowledge of the chemical composition of samples, yet can provide detailed information on both endogenous and exogenous chemicals in different biological sample types.  The Centre for Materials Research and Innovation at the University of Bolton has previously demonstrated expertise in the analysis of human saliva samples using 1H NMR-linked chemometric techniques in the diagnosis, prognosis, and severity monitoring of oral diseases, and have thus demonstrated the ability to complete the desired analyses.  The Centre's expertise extends to the assessment of sample integrity and intra-individual variation in salivary chemistry.  Furthermore, the Centre for Materials Research and Innovation has already developed the post-laboratory data processing and statistical methods necessary for full utilization of the generated data.  The NCI knows of no other providers that can provide the desired services, both laboratory and data analytic, and that have already demonstrated valid measurements of human saliva.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on February 18, 2010.  No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax). An original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist, at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference solicitation number NCI-100047-MM on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>This Project is an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) action. Receipt of award is contingent upon the offeror's meeting the requirements of Section 1512 (reports of use of funds) of the Recovery Act.

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to solicit proposals form qualified organizations to conduct a multicenter prospective, observational study:  The primary goals of this study are to acquire reliable and valid data to: (1) establish a U.S. national standard for normal fetal growth (velocity) and size for gestational age; (2) create an individualized standard for optimal fetal growth and size; (3) improve accuracy of fetal weight estimation based on ultrasound measures; and (4) construct an individualized standard for fundal height.
The secondary goals of this study are to: (1) recruit a cohort of women with a higher risk of gestational diabetes mellitus because of pregravid obesity and collect blood samples for etiologic research; (2) recruit a cohort of twin pregnancies with a similar number of monochorionic and dichorionic twins; (3) obtain blood samples for a prediction study of fetal growth restriction and/or overgrowth; and (4) obtain placental tissues and cord blood in selected cases and controls for studies on etiology of idiopathic fetal growth restriction, and in all twin gestations.  

The Government is currently conducting a multicenter prospective study to establish a U.S. national standard for normal fetal growth. The study aims to recruit (1) 2,400 low risk women with an equal number of White, Hispanic, African American and Asian race/ethnicity; (2) 600 obese women; and (3) 250 monochorionic and 250 dichorionic twin pregnancies.  Women will be recruited in the first trimester and followed up through pregnancy.  Each woman will receive 5 scheduled ultrasound exams, which include 2-dimensional (2D) and 3 dimensional (3D) fetal anthropometric measurements.   Uterine artery and fetal Doppler studies will be performed at selected gestational weeks.   After delivery neonatal anthropometic measures will be carefully taken.   Obstetric and neonatal information will be extracted from medical charts.   Blood samples will be collected at enrollment, at 16 to 18 weeks, 24 to 28 weeks in all subjects and at 6 weeks postpartum in selected subjects.  Placental tissues will be collected in selected subjects.   

The purpose of this acquisition is to recruit up to four additional clinical centers in the U.S. to participate in the ongoing study. Currently the following four sites were awarded contracts in 2008:   Columbia University, Medical University of South Carolina, Northwestern University and University of California at Irvine.

<DESC>RECOVERY TAS::14 1041:: TAS RECOVERY PINN PMIS #005396 and #005447 Demolish and Replace Flood Prone West Side Maintenance and Visitor Facilities and Replace 2 Trailers and Tent Cabin - West District, Chaparral. This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and is subject to the reporting requirements of the Act.  The project is located at two locations on the West Side of Pinnacle National Monument, approximately 12 miles from Soledad, California on State Highway 146, in Monterey County, California. The National Park Service (NPS), Denver Service Center, 12795 West Alameda Parkway, P.O. Box 25287, Denver, Colorado 80225-0287 anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price Design-Build contract based upon a two-phase selection procedure.  The project solicitation consists of two (2) phases.  This Pre-solicitation Notice represents Phase One, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), of the Two-Phase, Design-Build process.  To be further evaluated, firms must submit information in response to the criteria established in this RFQ by the specified due date and time.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 236220, and the U.S. Small Business Administration Size Standard is $31.0 million.  This project is available to all responsible Design-Build contractors meeting the above-referenced NAICS code and size standard and who are certified by the Small Business Administration as being an 8(a) Concern.  IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT COMPETITION WILL BE LIMITED TO 8(a) FIRMS LOCATED WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA SERVICED BY THE CALIFORNIA SBA DISTRICT OFFICES AND OTHER 8(a) CONSTRUCTION FIRMS  WITH A BONA FIDE PLACE OF BUSINESS WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHICAL COMPETITIVE AREA, AND THE ASSIGNED NAICS CODE.  ALL OTHER 8(a) D/B PARTICIPANTS ARE DEEMED INELIGIBLE TO SUBMIT OFFERS.
Overview: Having undergone schematic design, this project has established sites for all new construction, resolved and approved architectural programs for new facilities and drafted plans.  Architectural spatial relationships and sizing criteria, for buildings and sites, as well as circulation features shall be considered intact features or givens.  A former development proposal captures salient scale and massing goals.  This project shall sustain inherent conditions to a practical extent and integrate technical requirements to optimize sustainability, construction economy and architectural appearance.       
 Also included are Exhibit Construction Documents for the Visitor Contact Station (VCS).   The Exhibit Construction Documents will remain as the basis for design and cost with minor design changes required to coordinate with changes to the VCS design.
The two projects referenced above, will be issued in a single Design/Build Request for Proposal (RFP).  Work includes new construction at two undeveloped sites at the West Entry and redevelopment of the existing Chaparral Maintenance District.  The Chaparral District is approximately 2.4 miles from the west entry at the end of a confined narrow canyon.  
WEST ENTRY SITE:West Entry development has two undisturbed sites separated by a paved road leading to the Chaparral district.  Both sites are located in close proximity.
PINN 005396:  Work includes the following development:  site preparation and grading; improvements to existing park road; paved vehicular service roads and parking; utilities infrastructures (storm water, domestic water, sewer, power and telephone/network conduit) and construction of new buildings.  Contractor will provide visitor contact station (VCS), entry station, maintenance/fire/EMS building, maintenance yard, water and chlorination building, site grading, and site amenities (walks, plaza, hardscape areas and retaining walls).   A photovoltaic (PV) system will utilize both roof-mounted and ground-rack mounted arrays at the maintenance structure.  
For the VCS, perform limited design, perform translation to Spanish, and perform production and installation of interpretive exhibits.  Finally, provide and install audio-visual equipment in conjunction with the exhibits. 
Approximately several hundred yards northwest of the west entry construction site for the maintenance facility will be the Microwave Tower and Water Storage Tanks.  Work for these items includes trench, backfill and install conduit for future communications wiring; furnish and install one power home run and separate home run to water tanks; conduct lightning risk assessment for the tanks locations and make recommendations for protection; and install controls and appurtenances to monitor water level/water pressure readings in water tanks.  Utilize a single trench and provide gauges, power cable and equipment to link tower and tanks site with maintenance facility.  The tower will be located just north of the new tanks.  Construction of the tower and installation of wiring is not part of this contract. 

PINN 005447:  Work includes the following development:  two (2) 2-bedroom family residences and one (1) 4-bedroom house for group occupancy. The housing complex will be immediately adjacent to the maintenance facility and yard at the west entry site.  Within the housing site, contractor will perform building construction, site development work, grading, installation of utilities and provide paved access.  However, major infrastructure construction needed to serve the housing project is contained in the Visitor and Maintenance facility.
CHAPARRAL SITE:All work at this site is contained in PINN 005396.   At Chaparral, demolition of the following items is required: visitor contact/ranger station, maintenance/fire/SAR building, sewer lift station, footings and foundations, concrete flatwork, propane tanks, sheds, unpaved service drives, and removal of paving at road edge.  Random demolition includes visitor use facilities (picnic area, comfort station and trailhead parking area).  Utilities will be capped and abandoned-in-place.  Removal of one mobile housing unit is part of this project.  Restoration of site to natural flood plain is the goal.  Re-vegetation of this site is not part of this project.   New work includes constructing a PV/Generator building with roof-mounted PV array, propane tank and concrete pad, and connection to existing underground utilities. 
SUSTAINABILITY REQUIREMENTS:LEED Certification:Both projects are registered with USGBC, LEED 2.2v.  PINN 005396 will be LEED-NC Silver Level.  PINN 005447 will be LEED-H Silver Level.  Silver is viewed as the baseline level, and higher LEED certification potential will be entertained.  Contractor will assist an independent commissioning authority, primarily by data gathering and reporting.
BUILDING SYSTEMS REQUIREMENTS:Water services will utilize an existing well, drilled in 2001, which can serve the planned development.   A chlorination building, at the West Side site maintenance facility will house disinfecting equipment and appurtenances.  Wastewater treatment will utilize new septic systems.  This project is entirely off grid.  Electric power will be generated using PV arrays at both West Side and Chaparral sites.  Existing PV panels will be salvaged and supplemented with new panels.  PV collection systems will be installed at West Entry and Chaparral.  Inverters will convert DC to AC power system.  Energy conservation practices are reinforced through design.  No air-conditioning is planned.  Evaporative coolers will be used in lieu of refrigerant systems and central systems yield to natural ventilation and low-energy methods for providing comfort.  Heating systems are tailored to each structure's use and design characteristics.  High-efficiency, modulating-condensing, gas-fired boilers with hydronic radiant floor distribution will be used in VCS and housing construction.  Enhanced design standards will be applied to heating and cooling system selections as part of the technical requirements.  Battery structures will store PV power at both collection locations.  A propane fired generator provides temporary power if battery reserves are low.  Building envelope insulation and passive solar design techniques will promote mechanical systems efficiency.     
Experience With Issues and Special Construction Hardships Presented by this Project:
Remote site issues and absence of power, water or sanitary services on site will preclude establishment of a staff camp on site.  Contractor and sub-contractors can find a limited number of commercial lodging and dining choices at Soledad, a community of several thousand residents, about 12 miles from the park.  The nearest communities for construction supplies and a variety of services are between 40-45 miles from the West District entry.  The most noteworthy destination is Salinas, CA.  Finally, traveling Highway 146 will be slow with many narrow and winding turns.  Large or heavy vehicles may encounter load size restrictions and road/bridge weights limits.  
This project has some challenging site use restrictions.  Construction office staging and equipment and materials storage will be limited to the smallest feasible areas and near the job site to prevent widespread landscape damage.  Compounding matters, the West Entry sites are closely situated, making congestion an issue for visitor traffic, park vehicles and construction crews.  Conversely, the Chaparral site is 2.4 miles removed, requiring some duplication of supplies, equipment and services.  Finally, the phasing schedule, for keeping the West District open and operational throughout construction, requires attention to bringing facilities and utilities on-line in sequence.  This is necessary to minimize or avert loss of access to the resource, therefore sustaining communications, public health and safety, and visitor programs.
The contractor's proposal will be based upon Schematic Design drawings, project requirements narrative, and Performance Technical Specifications (PTS) that will be provided in a subsequent Request for Proposal Phase Two.  Contractor recommendations for creative cost savings and/or quality-enhancing design solutions will be considered via the later RFP/Phase Two process.  The project process will follow National Park Service (NPS) workflows (http://www.nps.gov/dsc/workflows/designbuild.htm ).
The estimated price is between $9,000,000.00 and $13,000,000.00, including all design and construction services. The contract provides for preparation of Design Development Documents, Construction Documents and Construction of the facilities.  ARRA funding has been secured for this project.
Record (redlined) hard copy drawings and As-Constructed AutoCAD file drawings are required upon construction completion.

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Government’s intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis from CACI Systems, Inc. (CACI),  14370 Newbrook Drive, Chantilly, VA 20151-2218 for 384,000 manhours  and associated Travel and Materials  that will provide  continued research, rapid design, development, integration, installation, test and evaluation, fielding, analysis, maintenance, training and logistics support  for  Navy, Army, Air Force, Special  Operations Forces, Joint Services, Federal Agencies, Counterdrug and other agencies Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems and sub-systems. These systems are employed within user locations or platforms including shipboard, aircraft/airborne, weapon systems, on small crafts, boats, shelters or vehicles.  The technical services are currently being performed by CACI under contract N00421-06-C-0074.  This acquisition will result in the modification of existing CACI contract N00421-06-C-0074 by increasing the current Option IV estimated labor and cost ceiling through the establishment of a new CLIN set with a performance period of 16 April 2010 through 15 April 2011.    This directed procurement is necessary as the current contract is scheduled to run out of contract ceiling by 15 April 2010, approximately six months early due to an increase in project requirements.  The proposed additional level of effort is needed for continuing the numerous on-going projects currently being done under Contract N00421-06-C-0074 while the follow-on action is being competed.  Awarding to any contractor other than CACI would result in unacceptable delays in completing or continuing tasks, such as the program requirements for Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication Systems (JWICS), National Guard Bureau (MGB), Unified Command Suite (UCS), Marine Corp Central Command (MARCENT), Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), United States Marshall Services (USMS) and Joint Mobile Intelligence Communication Systems (JMICS). These services are nonseverable as no other firm can provide the corporate capabilities, intergrated program support, technical expertise and resources needed to effectively meet the requirements of these programs.  CACI is the only source available that can meet the requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW) in the short time period (one-year) between the exhaustion of the current Option Year IV ceiling under, Contract N00421-06-C-0074 estimated at 16 April 2010 and the follow-on contract due to be awarded 15 April 2011.  Due to the on-going nature of the projects currently being done under Contract N00421-06-C-0074 and the need to continue these services without a break in work, CACI is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a follow-on contract.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETIVE PROPOSALS.  However, responsible interested parties may submit a capabilities statement in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider all information received by  19 February 2010, 1530 EST.  A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for any information received.  No telephone responses will be accepted.  For information contact Theresa Newbold, Code 2.5.1.2.2.3, Telephone (301) 342-9921, FAX (301) 757-2276 or via email: theresa.newbold@navy.mil.

<DESC><p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission intends to award a sole source modification to extend the period of performance of contract number CFMO-08-CO-0098 for information technology support services for CFTC's Division of Market Oversight, with Harvey Theberge. Under the contract, Harvey Theberge is assessing the statutory requirements for reviews of exchange (e.g., Designated Contract Markets) based IT systems and developing an appropriate assessment system. The contract is currently scheduled to expire on June 1, 2010. CFTC plans to extend the contract through November 30, 2010 to enable the contractor to complete testing of the review methods and processes, provide training to CFTC's Division of Market Oversight staff on how to conduct both initial and periodic technical reviews, and transition to a successor. CFTC anticipates that by the conclusion of the extended period of performance, CFTC staff will be proficient in conducting the final review methods and processes, thus the need for an expert in conducting the statutorily required reviews of information technology in place at exchanges and clearinghouses will no longer be required. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. However, the Government will consider responses from all responsible sources received by the date and time identified above. Written responses must include sufficient information to establish capability to fulfill the requirement. Any responses received will only be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in lieu of the sole source extension described in this notice, and such determination shall be made at the sole discretion of CFTC.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Integrated Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. This high performance green building project will continue the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation through the preservation and modernization of a historic federal building. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program commissions our nation's most talented architects, engineers, landscape architects, and interior designers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 - 100 years of service. GSA Design Excellence projects demonstrate the merit of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs, aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give public expression to our democratic values. As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principals for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA's P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). This GSA project has a goal to achieve Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating. Projects in or affecting historic properties must comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. This facility must be designed in metric units. This project will be delivered through the Design-Build delivery method.</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project consists of a modernization upgrade project for the Wayne Aspinall Federal Building. This work is performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). It is an existing multi-tenant professional office building with 3 stories above grade and a basement. The building contains 41,562 gross square feet (GSF), 36,907 rentable square feet (RSF), and 24,129 usable square feet (USF). The building will be fully occupied throughout the modernization project. Agencies located in the federal building are the U.S. Senate, General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Justice Immigration Review (EOIR), Department of Justice U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), Department of Justice U.S. District Courts, Department of Justice Probation, Department of Justice U.S. Attorney's Office, Corps of Engineers (USA COE), Social Security Administration (SSA), Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Department of Labor (LD)-Wage and Hour Division (WHD). The building is located at 400 Rood Avenue, Grand Junction, CO 81501. The building is a long-term GSA-held asset situated in a prime location in downtown Grand Junction with public transportation within the central business district. The Wayne Aspinall Federal Building is on the National Historic Register. Project goals and objectives for the federal building are to provide a pleasant, secure, and safe environment for the staff and visitors consistent with guidelines for Federal facilities and specifically the GSA PBS P-100; satisfy current and projected special-use needs, and allow for future expansion of these requirements; design facilities compatible with the building's existing character and local context, and present a positive image of U.S. Government facilities; use the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, which is the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of high-performance green buildings. Project goals and objectives are to improve energy efficiency of the building by replacing the mechanical system, upgrading the lighting/controls, upgrades to the domestic and mechanical plumbing systems/restrooms, upgrading accessibility, modernizing/replacing the elevator, replacing the upper and lower roof, upgrades to the interior common/public spaces in accordance with the building's historic aesthetic, upgrading the main lobby in accordance with the building's historic aesthetic, cleaning/restoring the building's exterior, upgrading the building and tenant security, ancillary tenant finish modifications, and compliance with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2007 (ARRA) Minimum Performance Criteria.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK Design Stage services and Construction Stage work are to be performed by the DB Contractor. Design Stage services include providing Design Concept and Design Development Phase services. Construction Stage work includes preparing construction documents and performing construction in conformance with the project requirements. The scope of services for the Design Stage will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, landscape architecture, construction phasing planning, BIM coordination, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents. The scope of services for the Construction Stage will require at a minimum: preparation of construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), CPM scheduling, BIM, scope management, value engineering, maintaining construction records, utilizing an electronic project management system in order to manage project documents, monitoring construction costs, commissioning, post-construction contract services (PCCS), demolition, construction, and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government. The Design-Build contractor shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, and the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration. Most importantly, the Design-Build contractor shall have complete responsibility for design and construction of the facility, including timely delivery within the project budget.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATEGY The General Services Administration intends to award a firm-fixed price Design-Build Contract based on the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals (the Short List will be published, however the RFP will NOT be published in FedBizOpps). All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. The contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)). In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process.

This solicitation will be evaluated under the Design-Build two-phase process utilizing best value trade-off acquisition procedures. <BR><BR>The Galveston District intends to award two or more Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) to SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS, with an estimated workload value of approximately $80,000,000.00 for SWG and SWD customers as follows:  Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area.  The contracts will contain a base period plus four one-year options for the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build and construction services with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $5 million and a minimum task order limitation of $3 thousand.  The minimum guarantee for the unrestricted MATOCs is $3000 and it only applies to the base period. <BR><BR>The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  The solicitation will be a two-phase negotiated acquisition; there will not be a public bid opening.  All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government.  <BR><BR>It is anticipated that the majority of the work will be limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  However, because SWD Services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered, therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical areas as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement.  <BR><BR>Scope of Work:  The MATO contracts are intended for multi-tasking of horizontal construction services for a wide variety of new construction, maintenance, repair, and alteration projects for Civil, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) Projects.

The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the unrestricted, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors.  However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the four contractor pools.  All contracts will remain active unless or until: 1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.<BR><BR>It is anticipated that one or more of the task orders under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.  <BR><BR><BR>CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two-Phase Design Build Process.

The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation and award the contracts to the responsible Offerors whose proposal conforms with all terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government considering technical design quality, performance capability and/or cost.<BR><BR>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 237990 (Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction) which corresponds to Standard Industrial Code (SIC) 1629.

<DESC>This is pre-solicitation notice for Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set aside.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA); Office of Asset Enterprise Management (OAEM) has a requirement to provide support to implement VAs Enhanced-Use Lease program so as to enable the Department to formulate, evaluate, and execute enhanced-use lease at the Ft Howard VAMC.1.	Background:  The purpose of this requirement is to obtain technical, financial and legal assistance and support to enable the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to accomplish Enhanced-Use Lease projects in a manner that maximizes available benefits to VA.  The Enhanced-Use Lease Authority, Title 38 United States Code Sections 8161-8169, allows the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to outlease facilities (available land, buildings, and other resources) to improve services, provide facilities, and/or generate revenue.  Enhanced-Use Leases are long-term leases (up to 75 years) of facilities under VAs jurisdiction of control to the public or private sector.  The facility can be used for both VA and compatible non-VA uses.  In return, VA receives cash and/or goods, services, facilities, or other in-kind consideration.  This program is administrated by VAs Office of Asset Enterprise Management (OAEM).OAEM follows instructions and guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and other agency instruction and guidance containing specific capital asset performance metrics.  Multi functional contractor support services are needed to assist the OAEM in a variety of functions that supports the enhanced-use lease management program in accordance with the Title 38, U. S. Code (38 USC  8161-8169) and other related laws and directives.  Under the Enhanced-Use leasing authority, VA is not required to follow the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) or the Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR), when selecting the enhanced-use lease lessee, but use of the FAR/VAAR as guidelines ensures integrity of the selection process.  The Fort Howard VA Campus (FHVC) is a division of the VA Maryland Health Care System (VAMHCS). The FHVC provides health care and services to the nations veterans, and it is located at 9600 North Point Road, Fort Howard, MD.

Scope:  The scope of this request for services is to implement the VAs Enhanced-Use Leasing program so as to enable the Department to formulate, evaluate, and execute an enhanced-use lease project at the FHVC.

<DESC>TITLE: XRA SIMAF (Simulation and Analysis Facility) Facilities and Infrastucture Sources Sought/Capability Request for Information
DESCRIPTION: The Air Force Material Command (AFMC), Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), Capabilities Integration Directorate at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is conducting market research analyses including Sources  Sought/Capability Request for Information (CRFI) for Government Market Research purposes. Before submitting any information to the Government, be advised that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information you provide.  Your responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.    Not responding to this CRFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP. Only responses from US companies will be accepted. Any information provided by the Government at this time is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to a formal release of a Request for Proposal.
Submission of Proprietary Information Caution:  The government appreciates that interested firms may not be able to respond to this Sources Sought/ CRFI without disclosing information deemed "proprietary" or "competition sensitive."   Data submitted in response to this CRFI will be widely distributed and discussed within the government as it will be used to assist in developing an acquisition strategy.  It is the responsibility of respondents to clearly mark submitted information with appropriate restrictive markings.   Respondents are further advised that the government's analyses of your responses may require disclosure to Advisory and Assistance Services contractor personnel.  All members of the evaluation team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent permitted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of the! ir obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All support contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts. The Government has also determined that the support contractor personnel have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information.  The government's support contractors will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement concerning proprietary information prior to being granted access to your data.    

The Government is seeking interested firms to furnish the following information: 
(1) Company name, address, point of contact, telephone number and e-mail address. (2) Business size (if 8(a) provide proof of certification, etc.) under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541712. (3) Under which NAICS does your company usually provide supplies identified above? Do you consider a NAICS code other than 541712 to be more appropriate as a classification for the supplies identified above? Please include the rationale for your answer. (4) Which of the following would you see as your role in the performance of a potential requirement of this nature (ref: Acquisition Strategy Briefing from Industry Day)? (a) Prime Contractor; (b) Subcontractor; or (c) Other, and please describe. (5) Based on the technical requirements defined in the Facilities and Infrastructure Requirements Definition Document, do you feel the entire effort can be priced and executed as a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Effort and why?  If not, which requirements do you feel could be executed as a FFP, what contract type do you recommend for the remaining requirements, and why? (6) Discuss how you would recommend coordinating your Facilities and Infrastructure activities with potentially multiple SIMAF Modeling Simulation and Analysis contractors.(7) What are your capabilities/strengths with respect to performing the XRA SIMAF Facilities and Infrastructure mission?(8) The Air Force is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for Small Businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability.  Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting).  The clause reads, in part, as follows:  "Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec 1996) (b) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction).  At least 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. (2) Supplies (other than procurement from a nonmanufacturer of such supplies).  The concern shall perform work for at least 50 percent of the cost of manufacturing the!  supplies, not including the cost of materials ."  Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc.  (9) AFMCFARS clause 5352.219-9001, "Use of Joint Ventures in Meeting the Limitations on Subcontracting Requirement (Nov 2007)" is planned for inclusion in this solicitation.  If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used.  Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.RESPONSES AND PAGE LIMITATIONS: Responses to this CRFI must be received No Later Than 1500 (EST) 11 Feb 2010.

These computing resources consist of traditional computing items, like memory, servers, CPU (central processing units), bandwidth.  Fractionalization allows each application to run inside this huge resource pool, but in a protected and manner apart from other applications.  Since the resource pool is much larger than what is actually being used, it is relatively fast and easy to extend application resources though the Managed Services vendor. <BR><BR>The Army anticipates utilizing a firm fixed price contract for this award.

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories.  In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.  The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.  The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.

Complexity

Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.  Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.

Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.  They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.  

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances – the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.  Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).  Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.  Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.

II.  Minimum Qualifications

•	U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.
•	Extensive experience in the engineering or project management field, including mastery of concepts, principles, laws and regulations associated with the broad areas of international relations, particularly as it relates to the development and implementation of post conflict and emerging development programs.  One year of this experience must be equivalent to the GS-13 level in the federal service. 
•	Understanding of architecture and engineering principles sufficient to be able to investigate and provide information and guidance on the range of systems, processes, and components inherent in the design and construction of new buildings, training facilities and related structures.
•	Understanding of contract administration principles, regulations and procedures, including US Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), DOS Acquisition Regulations, and commercial procurement procedures.
•	Ability to communicate effectively, orally and in writing, as well as the ability to interact with individuals at all levels.
•	Ability to multi-task, working on and bearing responsibility for several simultaneous in country projects while keeping the overall program and bureau goals in perspective. 
•	Skill in using word processing, spreadsheet, and data base computer applications.  Significant Microsoft Excel experience and expertise is required.

III. POSITION ELEMENTS

Supervisory Controls: The incumbent receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the Division Chief, the Executive Director/Controller, the Assistant Secretary and DASs.  The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations.

Although acting independently, the incumbent coordinates and communicates with not only the AIJS Chief and the Executive Director/Controller, but also with senior level officials in the Department and at post, as well as senior officials in participating USG agency and foreign governments individually or jointly involved in carrying out the INL mission.  The incumbent’s actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.  Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.  The AIJS Chief, the RM Director, the Assistant Secretary and DASs rely on his/her judgment in carrying out this mission.

<CONTACT>Cynthia Ingrao, Phone 619-532-8517, Email cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil
<DESC>A.	General Information  

The Southwest Region will be standardizing Peak Flow Meters.  This is a re-evaluation of this product group since the Regional Incentive Agreement with Monaghan has expired.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirements of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  In order to meet the total requirements of the Region a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items within a product category) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs’ needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. The product category includes peak flow meters and mouthpieces for adult and pediatric patients.  The entire category of Peak Flow Meters has an annual demand of over $35,000.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, Cardinal, currently serving the Southwest Region. 

The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Unit’s (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.

The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB.

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP’s Prime vendor program and obtaining a DAPA please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is May 2010.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.

B.	Products & Performance Required
 
The Southwest Region is seeking product line items in the category of Peak Flow Meters.  The product category includes peak flow meters and mouthpieces for adult and pediatric patients.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $35,000. This is a re-evaluation of this product group.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirements of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  

At the request of the Southwest Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

C. Instructions to Vendors

If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address), your answers to the technical questions/criteria below and product literature to cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil no later than February 25, 2010.  Submissions must be received by COB, 5:00 PM PST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.  If your product literature is more than 4MB in size, please mail your product literature to:

Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN 
Tri-Service Regional Business Office - Southwest Region 
34800 Bob Wilson Drive, Suite 110 
San Diego, CA  92134 
Phone:  (619) 532-8517

This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

D.	Evaluation Criteria

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.
Vendors will be required to provide detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and product literature. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.

The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

Technical/Company Criteria
1.	Vendor must manufacture and/or distribute a complete line of Peak Flow Meters used to assess the peak expiratory flow rate and measure the total expiratory flow.  A ‘complete line of product’ is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes the following products in the following sizes: Meter Peak Flow Full Range W/Zone Management, full and low range peal flow meters, adult mouthpiece, and pediatric mouthpiece.

2.	Products must meet the most current American Thoracic Society Standards for Spirometry adopted 1994 for Peak Flow Meters for 26 waveforms for accuracy, precision, and reproducibility and the educational guidelines recommended by the National Asthma Education Prevention Program (NAEPP) of the National Institutes of Health. 

3.	Products must have a logarithmic scale where resolution increases as flow rate decreases to simplify reading of peak expiratory flow rate; have a scale range of 60-800 liters/minute; have a clear chamber that allows patients to note when cleaning is required; have color zone strips which allow setting the personal best effort to the related green, yellow and red zones according to the NAEPP guidelines without calculation; have an internal indicator that cannot be affected by improper hand position on the peak flow meter; made of polycarbonate or acrylic material; have a disposable mouthpiece attachment available for multiple person use of  the same peak flow meter; be held in any sized hand; be portable and be assembled in a way that prevents the parts from being lost or broken during disassembly and cleaning.

4.	Vendors must provide one copy of written instructions/procedures for cleaning of your products; one copy of a diary for recording daily peak flow measurements and one copy of product literature in an electronic format and one copy of printed literature and/or catalog.

5.	Vendors must list the types of educational tools or materials they have for this product line and the type of staff training provided.

6.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Peak Flow Meters & Supplies product line. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submission. Vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.

7.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor Cardinal Health for distribution in the Southwest Region. Vendors whose products are not available through Cardinal Health will be disqualified.

8.	Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price.  Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off DAPA. Vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.

9.	Vendors must have a vendor representative(s) available in the Southwest Region. Please provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with the initial submission.

10.	Vendors must provide proof of corrective actions(s)/ resolution for any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.

11.	Vendors must identify if there is any latex component in the device or packaging.

12.	Vendors must provide the brand(s) of the products they manufacture or distribute.

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The TPRB will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 PM PST, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.  The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Does Not Meet Criteria, 2 = Partially Meets Criteria, 3 = Meets Criteria, 4 = Exceeds Criteria and 5 = Exceptionally Exceeds Criteria.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The score of each criterion will be analyzed.  If the score of the clinical/performance criterion partially meets or does not meet criteria, that vendor will be ineligible for RIA award consideration. The evaluations are conducted in a non-clinical setting.

A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.

Clinical/Performance Criteria
1.	The peak flow meter is easy to use and requires minimal training.
a.	The peak flow meter must be easy enough to use with minimal training so that children as well as adults can use it without difficulty or need for repeated instruction.

b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the non-clinical setting by use of the product at least 2 times.
c.	The evaluator will handle the meter and mouth pieces and verify if the design of both are designed to aid in handling in either hand, small or large, can be used in any position and is portable.  The expectation is that the meter and mouth pieces will be ergonomically ambidextrous for both pediatric and adult patients and easily portable.

Phase III – Pricing Analysis Process.  All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.

<DESC>Summary: This Request for Information (RFI) is issued in support of the anticipated acquisition of the Department of Justice's Asset Forfeiture (AF) Program and Agency support for law enforcement related investigations (Solicitation No. DJJE-10-RFP-0662). This requirement will result in the award of an Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for nationwide support services to support the Asset Forfeiture Management Staff (AFMS). Approximately 1,425 contractor personnel will provide clerical, analytical, legal, and administrative support at approximately 490 various DOJ offices around the country that are responsible for the administration of Federal Asset Forfeiture programs. At any given time, 2 -3% of the aforementioned positions may be part-time, the rest are full-time. It is anticipated that some contractor personnel will need access to Classified Information to perform the duties associated with this requirement. As such, respondents need to have a facility clearance that enables them to process secret and top secret clearances.
<p>The purpose of this request for information is twofold: first, to determine the acquisition strategy regarding small business participation, and second, to get industry comments on the draft Statement of Work (SOW). Through this Request for Information, the DOJ is requesting the capabilities and past performance of small business contractors interested in providing these services across DOJ Programs.

<CONTACT>Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing components or an integrated unit for a Raman spectroscopy system that will be incorporated into the column of an aberration corrected, monochromated FEI Titan 80/300 environmental scanning/ transmission electron microscope (ESTEM) to be installed at the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) by the end of 2010. The completed system will enable in situ Raman spectroscopy measurements to be made of samples located on an appropriately configured, standard form-factor TEM specimen holder.  The system will be initially used to characterize the gas phase composition, nature of adsorbed species, and types of carbon nanotubes formed by catalytic chemical vapor deposition from acetylene on Ni and/or Fe catalyst particles.  It is anticipated that the system will ultimately be used to characterize the chemistry occurring in a very wide range of dynamically evolving material systems.  Naturally, neither the completed system, nor any of its components must adversely affect the operation of the ESTEM in any way.  After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a Raman system or individual components that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.


NIST has a need for a Raman system or components that would meet the following requirements:
1.	Individual components or system during operation should not generate any AC or magnetic fields, vibrations or sound that could adversely affect the normal operation of the ESTEM.
2.	High power (8 Watts or more) 532 diode laser with narrow line and stable performance.
3.	Raman spectrometer assembly should be compact, with multiple gratings, 0.5 cm-2 resolution with cooling system other than liquid N2.  
4.	Raman probe head should be compatible with the typical size restrictions imposed by the confined geometry of the sample region in a TEM, provide a high signal to noise ratio, and be capable of in situ monitoring of gas-solid interactions.
5.	Collected as well as analyzed data should available in ASCII format and freely exportable to and compatible with commonly available graphics programs such as Excel and/or Origin. 
NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.  Please include your company’s size classification in any response to this notice.  
Companies that manufacture Raman systems or suitable components are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.  Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to todd.hill@nist.gov is currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

<RESPDATE>021910
<CONTACT>Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing an integrated unit for a ‘gas handling system’ to be connected to the gas-inlet valves attached to the column of an aberration corrected, monochromated FEI Titan 80/300 environmental scanning/ transmission electron microscope (ESTEM) to be installed at the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) by spring 2011. The completed system will enable us to make in situ observations of gas-solid interactions under various reactive environments.  The system will consist of a gas manifold with 5-6 inlets that can be connected to various gasses (O2, N2, H2, CO, C2H2, C2H4, NH3) in lecture bottle sized containers housed in an exhaust cabinet.  The rate of flow to the gas manifold will be controlled using mass flow controllers. There will be one outlet from the manifold that will be connected to the ESTEM. Naturally, neither the completed system, nor any of its components must adversely affect the operation of the ESTEM in any way.  After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a gas handling system or individual components that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.
Gas handling system should consist of following components and should meet the requirements as explained below:
1.	Gas manifold should be compact, capable of fitting into a space roughly 8 cm in diameter and 30 cm long with 5 inlets, safety valve and an outlet.
2.	Gas storage cabinet with exhaust line to accommodate 6 lecture-size bottles with regulators.
3.	Mass Flow controllers should be able to control flow rate in the order of Nml/min (sccm).
4.	Gauges to measure the pressure from 10-6 mbar to 200 mbar.
5.	Pneumatic and leak valves to control the gas flow.
6.	All the tubes, bellows and connectors, should be made of high grade stainless steel and should be bake-able up to 130 °C.
7.	None of the components should be magnetic.
8.	 All the connections will be vacuum (10-6 mbar) tight.
9.	It should be easy to modify/add new components/capability to the final system.

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.  Please include your company’s size classification in any response to this notice.  
Companies that manufacture gas manifold systems or components listed above are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.  Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to todd.hill@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

Concept is asystem that shall passively determinea line of bearing (LOB) to a radiofrequency (RF) energy source in the110 MHz to 1200 MHz at a minimum,but ideally would be capable ofoperating from 20 to 3000 MHz.  Theantenna should also provide an OMNIfeed from 20 to 3000 MHz  range.Physical limitations of energy sensingdevice is that its weight isapproximately 12 .0 lbs.  Its size is notto exceed 11 inches in diameter.   Theantenna must fit in an existing 11circular opening using existingmounting fixtures and cabling.  Theantenna head should mount nearlyflush with the skin of the fuselage.The aircraft is made of a compositecontaining a wire mesh that will beused as the ground plane.The processing portion of theequipment must support the following:be able to be treated as carry/carry off,be able to operate in non pressurizedspaces at altitudes up to 25,000 ft, becompliant with MIL-STD-810G foroperation with prop driven aircraft.  Theantenna must be mountable on theexterior of the air platform and haveminimal adverse effect on airworthiness. Supplier shall be able todemonstrate system operationalcapability within an accuracy of sub 10degree range (RMS) of the true relativebearing of the test signals.  Thesystem should be able to provide aLOB of less than 2.5 seconds durationfrom any direction.  Please provide anyinformation relating to other airplatforms on which this capability iscurrently fielded.  SPAWARSYSCENAtlantic is only interested ininformation on devices that arecurrently available on airborneplatforms or easily adaptable to theairborne environment.  Responses tothis RFI should be emailed to TonyMorga (antonio.morga@navy.mil ,phone:843-218-4733) or mailed toSPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic, ATTN:56330AM (Tony Morga), P.O. Box190022, N. Charleston, SC 29419-9022with a copy e-mailed to the ContractingOfficer, Deborah McNeely atdeborah.mcneely@navy.mil.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement.     This is a sources sought synopsis only.     This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.     The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the USCG.     The United States Coast Guard Aircraft Logistics Center is conducting market research to determine manufactures and suppliers described as follows:       

Spares and support are being considerred for a Video and Mission Processor (VAMP), P/N 7406715-00.  The VAMP provides all missions processing, graphics processing, and mission system interfaces for the Missions Systems Pallet (MSP).  It provides the ability to receive, store, process, and distribute multiple sensor videos and controls.  The VAMP also processes operator inputs from the keyboard, trackballs, and PEP at the two operator workstations located on the MSP.  Initial provision of this component is to provide pipeline sparing for the MSP, manufactured by Lockheed Martin (90536) 3333 Pilot Knob Road, Eagan, MN 55121-5121.  The U.S. Coast Guard intends to negotiate only with the OEM Lockheed Martin (90536).
The Coast Guard will not be able to provide manuals or drawings for this requirement.  Interested parties must have access to the OEM data and manuals.  

Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product details, brochures, and etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations, auxiliary equipment, and options.     Also, state approximate lead-time for acquiring your product.     Please provide the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the product.     Additionally detail if the VAMP has been qualified for use in any DOD or Federal Government Aircraft.     The Government believes the applicable NAICS code is 336413 -- Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing.     

Please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business?     (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified hub zone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business?     (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned?       (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POC?s and contract numbers? (9) If possible, any POC?s for civilian users for general usage of product questions.     After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the FBO.           Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement.     All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis.     Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the USCG. The United States Coast Guard Aircraft Logistics Center is conducting market research to determine manufactures and suppliers described as follows: 

Repair of the WESCAM MX15 FLIR system and associated components utilized on the HU25C+ and HU25D model aircraft.  The MX15 FLIR turret houses two gyro stabilized sensors.  The infrared (IR) sensor is a high magnification step-zoom sensor.  The Electronic Optical Wide (EOW) sensor is a low magnification continuous zoom color television sensor.  The Master Control Unit (MCU), the Operator Control Unit (OCU), and the Joy Stick control the turret.  All of these components are contained in the SSO (Sensor System Operator) workstation, except for the MCU, which has a rack of its own.  While failure to provide repaired parts would not ultimately result in grounded aircraft, it does limit the missions the aircraft can perform.  Search and rescue would still be able to be performed, but the law enforcement portion would be limited.  The MX-15 FLIR provides stabilized infrared and video imaging for search and surveillance.  The system allows the operator to search large areas with either an Electr-Optical Wide (EOW) color camera or an infrared high magnification step-zoom sensor.  This procurement must be restricted to the OEM.  This requirement is necessary in order for the USCG to maintain the capability to adequately support their deployed aircraft and carry out their law enforcement mission. The Original Equipment Manufacturer for the MX15 FLIR is  Wescam, Inc., 649 North Service Road West, Burlington, Ontario L7P5B9

The Coast Guard will not be able to provide manuals or drawings for this requirement. Interested parties must have access to the OEM data and manuals. 

Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product details, brochures, and etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations, auxiliary equipment, and options. Also, state approximate lead-time for acquiring your product  or repair. Please provide the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the product. Additionally detail if the MX15 FLIR has been qualified for use in any DOD or Federal Government Aircraft. The Government believes the applicable NAICS code is 334511 -- Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing. 

Please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified hub zone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule?

<DESC>RECOVERY:  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  The Bureau of Land Management, National Operations Center (NOC), intends on utilizing an existing, previously competed, Single Award BPA for GCDB and Land Records Services contract to procure services for Control Document Index (CDI) aperture cards in Arizona.  The BPA being utilized is L07PD04989, and was awarded to Premier Data Services through GSA contract number GS-35F-0418K.   This opportunity is only available to the current contract holder.  This notice is not a solicitation for offers.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be sent to the designated BPA contract holder.  This acquisition falls under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 518210 and Product Service Code D315.  Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing by email to Chad Hepp, Contracting Officer, at Chad_Hepp@blm.gov.  Below is a general description of the services required.
This project will involve scanning up to 275,500 land status records from micro-graphic copies of legal documents mounted on aperture cards, as well as an additional 4,500 paper documents.  These records are within the 3,014 Arizona townships and include townships identified as having existing renewable energy applications/authorizations or high renewable energy potential.  The database this creates will enable the BLM to more efficiently evaluate leases for renewable energy or other projects more efficient, thereby saving the public and agency time in the application process.  This will also improve the automation and quality assurance of BLMs current land status information.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">METHOD of SELECTION/OPERATION, INSURANCE and PHYSICAL EXAM REQUIREMENTS: The CBP Office of International Affairs will evaluate the resume and questionnaire packages received for technical ability. CBP may exclude any applicant from consideration if it is unable to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of his/her qualifications from the documents submitted. Qualified and otherwise acceptable candidates will then be added to a Qualified Bidders List from which IC candidates are selected and may be awarded an order/contract for one or more assignments in the future as needs arise. Prospective ICs must be physically fit, able to perform the duties of an assignment and may be required to obtain a physical examination and certification that they are fit for travel anywhere in the world for assignments up to 180 calendar days. If selected for a contract award and CBP elects to require that the prospective IC obtain a physical, CBP will reimburse the IC for reasonable actual costs (not to exceed $500.00) by including this item on the order/contract, as described above. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">ICs are required to obtain emergency evacuation insurance coverage when traveling to foreign locations. The order/contract document will provide for reimbursement of reasonable actual costs for this coverage (not to exceed $500.00). In situations where an IC currently has emergency evacuation insurance coverage in place which will extend through the period of proposed performance, new coverage need not be obtained. In such cases, the IC must present written proof of coverage to the officer making the inquiry as to availability before an order will be placed.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">REQUIRED REGISTRATION @ WWW.CCR.GOV: Prospective ICs must be registered and have "ACTIVE" status in the government CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR) system at www.ccr.gov prior to issuance of an order/contract. CBP strongly recommends that applicants complete their registration as soon as possible after submitting an application. The process involves input of business information and registration with Dun and Bradstreet to obtain a D&amp;B number. Applicants must include their D&amp;B/DUNs # on the questionnaire (see above). </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">NOTE:</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> Applicants must follow up this process aggressively to ensure that ACTIVE status is attained. Registration data is valid for one year and must be updated at time of expiration in order for status to remain ACTIVE.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">ORDER/CONTRACT DOCUMENT, COMMENCEMENT OF PERFORMANCE, ORDER CEILING: Once CBP identifies a requirement and selects a prospective IC, a CBP officer will contact the applicant and inquire as to availability for an assignment. If the selected applicant is available and all requirements are satisfied, a CBP Contracting Officer will prepare a suitable order/contract document in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (i.e., FAR, viewable at http://www.acqnet.gov/far/). The order/contract will be in the form of a Labor Hours type contract awarded in accordance with FAR 16.602 and the document will contain the detailed statement of work for the specific assignment, including services required, estimated time required, country/destination, travel dates, materials and topics to be addressed, and other applicable information. The Contracting Officer will submit the completed order/contract document to the selected IC for review, concurrence, and acceptance. The order will become a legal binding contract once the Contracting Officer receives written acceptance from the IC. The duration of contract performance shown on the contract document and resulting dollar amount constitutes a ceiling, beyond which the IC performs at his/her own risk. If needs arise which call for the IC to provide services for an additional period of time, the Contracting Officer will issue a modification which provides necessary funding and authorization for continued performance within specified limits.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">ORDER/CONTRACT INVOICING and PAYMENTS: Payments are processed by CBP in arrears, in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act as implemented by FAR clause <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, with its Alternate 1. </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>ICs are to submit an invoice for services rendered under their contract no more frequently than once per month (in arrears), unless otherwise specifically authorized in the order/contract document.

<DESC>This is a Special Notice with an intent to sole source to Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education for accreditation of post MD Medical training program in the United States.
Background
The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education is a private, non-profit council that evaluates and accredits both Institutions sponsoring post-MD level education programs and medical residency programs within those institutions in the United States. 
The mission of the ACGME is to improve health care by assessing and advancing the quality of resident physicians’ education through accreditation. 
In academic year 2008-09, there were 8,186 ACGME-accredited residency programs in 120 specialties and subspecialties. The number of active full-time and part-time residents for academic year 2005-06 was 103,367. 
The ACGME has 28 review committees (one for each of the 26 specialties, one for a special one-year transitional-year general clinical program, and one for institutional review). Each residency committee comprises about 6 to 15 volunteer physicians. Members of the residency review committees are appointed by the AMA Council on Medical Education and the appropriate medical specialty boards and organizations. Members of the Institutional Review Committee and Transitional Year Committee are appointed by the ACGME Executive Committee and confirmed by the Board of Directors. 
The ACGME's member organizations are the American Board of Medical Specialties, American Hospital Association, American Medical Association, Association of American Medical Colleges, and the Council of Medical Specialty Societies. Member organizations each appoint four members to the Board of Directors, which also includes two resident members, three public directors, the chair of the Council of Review Committee Chairs and a non-voting federal representative
The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) is the ONLY entity responsible for the accreditation of post-MD medical training programs within the United States.

Scope of work

Accredit NIH as an institutional sponsor for graduate medical education and accredit 16 post-MD medical training programs at NIH.
 

Deliverables

Accreditation of the NIH Clinical Center as a sponsor of Graduate Medical Education. In addition, accreditation certificates of 16 post-MD medical training programs at NIH that train over 100+ medical students.

The anticipated award date is on or before 2/22/2010.

If there are any interested offerors please submit capabilities to provide services otherwise the Government reserves the right to award to Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education

<DESC>This is a re-posting of NIH-NICHD-RFI-11-09.  There are no modifications to the content to the previous posting.

Purpose
This is a time-sensitive Request for Information that will be used to assess the need to perform pediatric labeling studies of ketamine for short term procedures performed in the Emergency Department.
“This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, applications, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes only.” 
Background
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) legislation enacted in 2002 (renewed in 2007), directs the (NIH) in consultation with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and experts in pediatric research, to develop and prioritize a list of “off-patent” drugs for which pediatric studies are most urgently needed. 
Ketamine has become one of the most favored drugs used by emergency physicians for sedation of children in the Emergency Department. Despite its extensive use, ketamine is not labeled in pediatrics by the Food and Drug Administration. Ketamine has been prioritized for study by NICHD under BPCA since February 2004.
 Recently, concerns have arisen about the safety of ketamine due to the appearance of proapoptopic effects in the developing central nervous system in young experimental animals.  Neuro-apoptosis have been demonstrated in rodents and non-human primates at doses several fold higher that those used in children. Additionally, in young experimental animals neuro-apoptotic lesions have been associated with long term behavioral deficits.
Information Requested
The NIH is especially interested in concrete and relevant suggestions to the following questions in order to determine the scientific and regulatory need to sponsor clinical drug studies on the pediatric use of ketamine for short term procedures in the Emergency Room. 
Questions
1.	Are there sufficient data to assess the neurotoxicity of single exposure to ketamine?  To what extent is the dose(s) used in nonclinical studies relevant to the exposure levels used in ER departments to achieve sedation and analgesia for short-term procedures?

2.	Are the data on the dosage of ketamine in experimental young animals applicable to children receiving ketamine for short term procedures in the Emergency Department?

3.    The vulnerability period for the development of neuroapoptosis lesions after ketamine exposure spans from the third trimester of pregnancy to approximately 3 years of age; however the drug is most commonly used in the ER in children 3 years and older. Could labeling studies be safely be performed in children between 3 and 12 years of age? 
4.   Are data on the pharmacodynamics of ketamine in experimental animals applicable to human study designs? Conversely, are there issues in experimental studies that need to be considered in the design of pediatric studies?
5.  Considering the large inter-individual variability in the metabolism of ketamine, should studies be performed to analyze the effects of polymorphisms (CYP2B6, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) and ontogeny (CYP2C9) of the ketamine-metabolizing enzymes in  pharmacokinetics and adverse events?
6.  If a two phased study ( i.e., pharmacokinetics and or pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics study followed by an efficacy and safety clinical study) is requested,  which pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic  measurements and efficacy and safety endpoints should be included?
7.  Considering that racemic ketamine is used in the United States, should PK studies include measurements of ketamine enatiometers?
8.  How should the study population of children receiving ketamine for short term procedures in the ER    be defined?
 How to Submit a Response

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 5.205(c), this is a Special Notice from Naval Facilities Engineering Command Northwest in support of the Navy Energy Program.
The Navy in the Northwest Region is in the preparatory stages of embarking on a renewable energy initiative that will increase our energy efficiency and mission effectiveness. This initiative will reduce our reliance and dependence on fossil fuels, foreign oil and furthermore reduce our carbon footprint. To assist in the planning and programming of this strategic effort, the Navy will host a Renewable Energy Symposium to aid in identifying the private sector expertise, experience and capability that will assist the Navy in this endeavor. While specific projects have not yet been identified, the Navy will present information on our current base infrastructure and outline the Navy's recently published Energy Strategy, which provides a framework for achieving specifically stated renewable and alternative energy goals.
The Symposium will be held on Wednesday, 3 March 2010 in the theater at the Submarine Museum in front of Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Keyport Washington. (http://www.navalunderseamuseum.org/) Registration will begin at 0800 and the event will kick off at 0830 and last until approximately 1130. A box will be available in which to place business cards, brochures and other marketing materials. 
Parties interested in attending the symposium should respond to this Special Notice no later than 4:30 PM (Pacific Standard Time) on 22 February 2010 to Debra Hammons at debra.hammons@navy.mil.  Please provide names and number of attendees.

No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges will be incurred by the Government as a result of contractor responses to this announcement or participation in the Symposium.

<p>The purpose of this task order&nbsp;is to provide support of the United States Virgin Islands American Recovery and Reinvestment Act In-kind Support. The anticipated period of performance for this work assignment will be from February 5, 2010 though November 3, 2010. The primary objective of this task order is to assist EPA Region II in providing management tools in the areas of sanitary sewage, watershed planning, and green infrastructure for the US Virgin Islands:<br />(a) The sources of fecal coliform pollution are difficult to determine. US Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR) believes that failing septic systems contribute greatly to fecal coliform pollution. The task order will assist DPNR in investigating this possibility.<br />(b) Rainfall and observed data statistics would provide insight to longer range watershed planning.<br />(c) The Green Infrastructure task described in this Task Order is intended to target reduction in urban runoff and pollutant loadings by managing the runoff as close to its sources as possible.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

Requirements for the TO include the following: 1) attending meetings and conference calls with city, state, and EPA representatives; 2) preparing a site-specific Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) and Health &amp; Safety Plan (HASP); 3) preparing a site-specific Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP); 4) conducting an American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) compliant Phase I final report; 5) performing ASTM compliant Phase II field investigation work and generating a final report; 6) performing risk assessment activities and generating a final report; 7) preparing remedial action planning documents; 8) preparing data packages and remedial planning documents for submittal to and review by the Ohio EPA; 9) preparing Property Profile Forms (PPF) or entering site-specific information into EPA Assessment, Cleanup, and Redevelopment Exchange System (ACRES) Database; 10) complying with the documentation and reporting requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (AARA) of 2009.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ("ARRA" or "the Act") contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's START (Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team) contracts were awarded as IDIQ contracts, they were awarded competitively with fixed rates, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the type of services to be performed. The existing START contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance and to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing START contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Capability: The offeror's demonstrated technical capability to meet the Government's requirement.<br /><br />Factor 2: Past Performance: The offeror's demonstrated record, as confirmed by references, of successful past performance of the same or substantially similar contract efforts including quality of services or supplies, timeliness of performance and delivery, cost control and the offeror's business relations.<br /><br />Sources (i.e. Government databases or other individuals) other than those identified in the offeror's proposal may be contacted/accessed by the Government. The Government may use the additional information received in its evaluation of the offeror's past performance and responsibility determination.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than the cost or price. Although the proposed cost or price is not listed as an evaluation factor, it shall be considered a significant criterion in the overall evaluation of proposals. The factors listed above are in descending order of importance.<br /><br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of provision) <br />Advertisements, Publicizing Awards, and News Releases</p>
<p>All press releases or announcements about agency programs, projects, and contract awards need to be cleared by the Program Office and the Contracting Officer. Under no circumstances shall the Contractor, or anyone acting on behalf of the Contractor, refer to the supplies, services, or equipment furnished pursuant to the provisions of this contract in any publicity news release or commercial advertising without first obtaining explicit written consent to do so from the Program Office and the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Contractor agrees not to refer to awards in commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the product or service provided is endorsed or preferred by the Federal Government or is considered by the Government to be superior to other products or services.</p>
<p>Disruption of Services</p>
<p>The performance of this agreement by either party is subject to Acts of God, government regulations, man-made or natural disaster, civil unrest, labor disputes, shortage of materials or any other emergency making it inadvisable or impossible to provide the facilities/services or hold the NCS Training Event. Because of the special nature of this group, should any of the above situations occur in any location in the United States, including its territories, which would require action and participation by the attendees resulting in poor (less than 65%) or no attendance, the National Communications System may cancel or reduce its commitment to the vendor without penalty or liquidated damages.</p>

<DESC>This is a non-competitive combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation No. DTRT57-10-Q-80051 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 12. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38. The NAICS Code is 531120 and the Small Business size standard is $6.0M. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order on a Non-competitive basis with Enterprise Holdings, Inc., Burlingame, CA. The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) has a requirement to lease three parking spaces from the Enterprise Care Rental Company in order set up a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensor needed to conduct wake turbulence measurements at San Francisco International Airport (SFO), in accordance with the following Statement of Work.
<p>Statement of Work (Begin)</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Volpe Center is to lease three parking spaces from the Enterprise Car Rental Company located on 1333 Bayshore Highway, Burlingame, CA, in order to set up a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensor needed to conduct wake turbulence measurements at San Francisco International Airport (SFO). The Volpe Center is given the responsibility by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to collect, process and analyze wake turbulence data to support the designs of wake mitigation solutions for its NextGen effort. Currently 75 percent of the FAA wake turbulence program funding is from the NextGen office, and it is anticipated that in FY11, the funding profile will be 100 percent from NextGen. One of the NextGen deliverables required of the FAA in FY10 is to study the feasibility of dependent approaches for Closely Spaced Parallel Runway operations under Instrument Meteorological Conditions involving Heavy and B757 aircraft. The envisioned procedure is termed WTMA, which stands for Wake Turbulence Mitigation for Arrivals. WTMA is considered a key enabling piece towards the realization of NextGen.</p>
<p>The objective of the Volpe Center's LIDAR deployment at SFO is to collect wake vortex measurements off Heavy and B757 aircraft in support of the FAA's WTMA procedural study. These types of aircraft typically fly to major international routes and SFO is one of the few locations in the United States with significant number of Heavy and B757 class aircraft operations. The study also requires measurements of vortices generated between 150-200 feet altitude range. This means a candidate test site should be somewhere between 3860 ft to 4800 feet from the runway threshold. For SFO, this technical specification means we are restricting our search in the city of Burlingame, CA, between 1200 to 1333 Bayshore Highway. Ideally, the LIDAR would be deployed sometime between February 22, 2010 and February 28, 2010 to ensure a timely removal of the system from its current location.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The vendor shall provide the Volpe Center an area of the equivalent to three parking spaces to host a trailer carrying the pulsed lidar sensor in the form of a lease. The vendor shall ensure the immediate area between the Lidar and the bay is in its natural un-obstructed state. Volpe Center personnel and contractors shall be allowed access to the site to perform other installation related and maintenance tasks with a minimum of one day advanced notice.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>One year from Date of Award, with an option for an additional year.</p>
<p>Statement of Work (End)<br /><br />Proposal Pricing: The Contractor shall provide a proposal on the following items. Please provide the most current Lease Agreement with your proposal.</p>
<p>CLIN 0001 - Lease of Land for 1 year, in accordance with the SOW above, Quantity: 1 YR, Total Price tiny_mce_marker__________; CLIN 0002 - Optional Line Item - Lease of Land for 1 additional year, Quantity: 1 YR tiny_mce_marker__________. The signed offer must be submitted electronically, via email to Karen.Marino@dot.gov. The offer should be addressed to the following: U.S. Department of Transportation, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, Attn: Karen M. Marino, RVP-32, 55 Broadway, Cambridge, MA 02142 no later than 2:00 P.M. EST on February 10, 2010.</p>
<p>The following FAR clauses and provisions are incorporated by reference (IBR) into the solicitation and the resulting purchase order, with addenda as indicated. FAR 52.212-1, Instruction of Offerors-Commercial Items is hereby incorporated by reference; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, the Offeror is reminded that as of January 1, 2005, it must provide Certifications and Representations online at least annually via ORCA at the following website: http://orca.bpn.gov; FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, is hereby incorporated by reference. FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items are hereby incorporated by reference. Additional clauses cited in 52.212-5 that apply to this acquisition are: 52.203-6, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.223-15, 52.223-16, 52.232-30, 52.232-33, and 52.222-41. FAR Clause 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract also applies to this RFQ. These references may be viewed at www.arnet.gov. No telephone requests will be honored. When award is made a firm fixed-price purchase order is anticipated. The Government will not pay for any information received. ATTENTION: Small and Disadvantaged (SDB), Women-Owned, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs). The Department of Transportation's (DOT) Short-Term Lending Program (STLP) offers working capital financing in the form of lines of credit to finance accounts receivable for transportation-related contracts.

If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.<br />(2)<br />(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-<br />(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or<br />(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or<br />(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.<br />(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.<br />(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.<br />(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.<br />(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.<br />(6) In accordance with FAR 13.004, the following information regarding quotations is provided:<br />Legal Effect of Quotations<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. <br />(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate quotations as described in FAR 13.106-2 on a Best Value basis considering price and technical acceptability. Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government may accept other than the lowest quote; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received. <br />(h) Multiple awards. (To be used at the Contracting Officers discretion) The Government may accept any item or group of items of a quote, unless the vendor qualifies the quote by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, quotes may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity quoted, at the unit prices quoted, unless the vendor specifies otherwise in the quote.<br />(i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation.<br />(1)(i) The GSA Index of Federal Specifications, Standards and Commercial Item Descriptions, FPMR Part 101-29, and copies of specifications, standards, and commercial item descriptions cited in this solicitation may be obtained for a fee by submitting a request to--<br />GSA Federal Supply Service Specifications Section<br />Suite 8100<br />470 L'Enfant Plaza, SW<br />Washington, DC 20407<br />Telephone (202) 619-8925)<br />Facsimile (202 619-8978)<br />(ii) If the General Services Administration, Department of Agriculture, or Department of Veterans Affairs issued this solicitation, a single copy of specifications, standards, and commercial item descriptions cited in this solicitation may be obtained free of charge by submitting a request to the addressee in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this provision. Additional copies will be issued for a fee.<br />(2) Most unclassified Defense specifications and standards may be downloaded from the following ASSIST websites:<br />(i) ASSIST (http://assist.daps.dla.mil).<br />(ii) Quick Search (http://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch).<br />(iii) ASSISTdocs.com (http://assistdocs.com).<br />(3) Documents not available from ASSIST may be ordered from the Department of Defense Single Stock Point (DoDSSP) by--<br />(i) Using the ASSIST Shopping Wizard (http://assist.daps.dla.mil/wizard);<br />(ii) Phoning the DoDSSP Customer Service Desk (215) 697-2179, Mon-Fri, 0730 to 1600 EST; or<br />(iii) Ordering from DoDSSP, Building 4, Section D, 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5094, Telephone (215) 697-2667/2179, Facsimile (215) 697-1462.<br />(4) Nongovernment (voluntary) standards must be obtained from the organization responsible for their preparation, publication or maintenance.<br />(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all quotations exceeding $3,000, and quotations of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The vendor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its quotation, the annotation ``DUNS'' or ``DUNS +4'' followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the vendor's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the vendor to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. A vendor within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. A vendor located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The vendor should indicate that it is a vendor for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.<br />(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of a quotation, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the vendor does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered vendor. Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br /><br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St. SW, JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692 <br />Fax: (202) 475-3904</p>

<p>Quotes must include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (June 2008, with its offer.</p>
<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />Evaluation and Award: The government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quote conforming to the solicitation provides the best value to the government.<br />QUOTES SHALL BE EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>The offeror shall identify at least two (2) relevant (construction, overhaul, repair and alteration of ships) and current federal, state or local government or private contracts performed during the last three (3) years. For each contract, list:</p>
<p>a. Contract number and customer point of contact (including two (2) points of contact <br />With telephone numbers)<br />b. Dollar value of the contract (Original and Final)<br />c. Type of service performed and whether Prime or subcontractor<br />d. Required completion date for the contract<br />e. Date the services were actually completed<br />f. Ship Name, Hull Number<br />g. Contract type (FFP, IDIQ, Requirement, Cost Type)<br />h. Percentage of growth in contract price (Additional work divided by award price)</p>
<p>If subcontracting arrangement is proposed, the above data must also be provided for each first tier subcontractor. If a joint effort or teaming arrangement is proposed, highlight previous experience with the proposed team or subcontractor.</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will take into account the guidelines outlined at FAR 15.305(a)(2) Past Performance Evaluation. The contractor's past performance will be evaluated according to the following factors and questions: <br />- Quality of Product or Service<br />--Did the customer get what was specified?<br />--Did the customer consider the final product high in quality?<br />--If warranty issues arose, were they promptly corrected?<br />- Timeliness of Performance<br />--Was the contract completed on time? If not, reason why not (growth work, contractor delayed, government delayed?)<br />- Business Relations<br />--How was the customer service? Was the contractor committed to customer satisfaction?<br />--Would you use this company again (Why/Why not)?<br />- Subcontracts<br />Were subcontracts involved? Comments?</p>
<p>In evaluating contractors past performance, the government intends to also review U.S. Coast Guard Contractor Performance Reports and other existing past performance ratings on relevant contracts. General trends in a contractor's performance will also be considered.</p>
<p>PRICE:</p>
<p>Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quotes. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness. The contracting officer will also calculate the foreseeable cost of transporting the USCGC WAHOO (WPB-87345) to offeror's commercial shipyard. Foreseeable costs will be calculated for the purpose of price evaluation only.</p>
<p>****Past Performance is more important than Price****</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Offeror's are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal. All qualified responsible business sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. 
APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Proposals received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx . Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM , respectively.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), to ensure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies. OPS performs these functions through three teams, namely, Operations Support Team, Overseas Administration Team and Field Support Team. The Operations Support Team provides technical guidance and expertise in Disaster Logistics, Search and Rescue, Operations Center Management, Military Liaison, and Consequence Management. It also provides overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and to other sectors necessary to ensure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies. The Military Liaison Unit (MLU) is part of this team and manages OPS liaison with the U.S. Military.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military (HAA/M) position was established to more effectively coordinate the activities of MLU. These activities include military liaison and coordination, Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) deployment, Response Management Team (RMT) participation and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, or Explosive (CBRNE) disaster planning under Presidential Decision Directive 39/62. The HAA/M will be located within the OPS's MLU and functions as the Division's principal point of contact with the Department of Defense (DoD).</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to contractor's question.
<p><br />Question: Regarding solicitation# FA2517-10-T-6020, the NAICS code for the requirement is 423430 which is for small business size of less than 100 employees. However, in the solicitation posted on FedBizOpps, it says the size standard is 500 employees (see the snippet below from solicitation). Please correct the solicitation so that it appropriate reflects the SBA size standard of 100 employees for NAICS code 423430.</p>
<p>(iv) This acquisition is procured as full and open competition. The NAICS code for this requirement is 423430, Computer and Computer Peripheral Equipment and Software Merchant Wholesalers. The size standard is 500 employees and a single award will be made as a result of evaluation of quotes.</p>
<p>Response: The Table of Small Business Size Standards, 22 August 2008, located on the U.S. Small Business Administration website under Sector 42, Wholesale Trade, states "the nonmanufacturer size standard of 500 employees shall be used for purposes of Government procurement of supplies."</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR G-IIILASER SCAN.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This noticeserves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will notbe issued.The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received.Q1. Have the dates for the scan been fixed, or will we have access to the aircraftanytime after the contract is awarded until the end of the month?  A1. The exact dates have not been fixed, but we want the scan done as soon as possibleafter contract award is made, and no later than February 28, 2010.Q2. What business hours will the aircraft be available?  Will we have 24 hour access?A2. 24 hour access will not be an option.  Business hours will nominally be 7:00am to4:00pm, but could be a little earlier and later if needed.Q3. What sort of previous work experience documentation is required?	Is there aspecific government form we need to submit?A3. No specific government form needs to be submitted.	Previous work experiencedocumentation is something that gives us a level of assurance that you understand themodeling requirements and the level of fidelity needed in the CAD model.  For example,prior experience in developing CAD models for aircraft aerodynamic analysis would beuseful.Q4. SOW says that the wing of a GIII is approximately the size of a Boeing 737, but the737 seems much wider than the GIII, is that right?A4. Gulfstream-III wing is 77 feet 10 inches in span and the 737 wing span is 93 feet.	Q5. What is the level of details (resolution) do you want for the scan. Is it importantfor you to have windows contour or panels joint line in the solid CAD model?Note : Resolution differs from accuracy : what is the smallest detail you would like tosee from the scan?A5. The scan needs to be accurate to within +/- 0.01 inches.  We do not expect to seepanel joint lines or vortex generators or detail that small in the model.Q6. For the CAD model : Do you expect smooth surfaces, thus eliminating physical modelshape defaults? Otherwise, CAD model will include these shape defaults.A6. The CAD model and especially the wing surfaces need to be smooth.  The flap covemodels need to be very detailed and include every bit of detail in the area.The due date for receipt of offers is extended to 2/10/2010.Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASAAcquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 02/04/2010.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The FHWA, through the Office of Planning, Environment, and Realty is soliciting for proposals for research and development projects that could lead to transformational changes and revolutionary advances for transportation planning in the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The objective of this BAA is to advance the practice and application of transportation planning among state, metropolitan, regional, local, and tribal transportation planning governments in response to significant changes in the planning process and to identify new tools, techniques, and approaches that respond to national transportation planning priorities. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">1.6 Program Scope</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The program scope is intentionally ambitious and broad to address the wide spectrum of topics and objectives that the funded investigations can support. This program is intended to spur innovation and focus on high risk and high pay-off research and development projects. Incremental advances, demonstrations of existing technologies or applications of state and metropolitan transportation planning activities are not within the scope of this program. </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The FHWA strongly encourages proposals that offer a significant non-federal matching funds or in-kind resources. Good proposals will evidence strong internal backing with matching funds, innovative approaches in contracting and leveraging current and past technology development efforts that support this program. Such proposals will receive consideration in addition to and above how they respond to the technical criteria above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cost reasonableness and realism will also be considered in the overall selection process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under the announcement.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (4 FEBRUARY 2010)</span><br /><br />QUESTION 1:</strong>&nbsp; Is it a requirement that this software be these exact applications or can other applications that meet the same or similar features be acceptable?<br /><br /><strong>ANSWER 1:</strong>&nbsp; Other software is acceptable as long as it offers the same or similar features.<br /><br /><strong>QUESTION 2:</strong>&nbsp; Hard Drive:  Specifies Hitachi (or equivalent). Will an equivalent be acceptable should it meet all the requirements of speed, cache?<br /><strong><br />ANSWER 2:</strong>&nbsp; An equivalent is acceptable as long as it meets all of the specifications identified.<br /><br /><strong>QUESTION 3:</strong> The drives that my resellers will submit will have 3 year warranties.  Is the warranty called out in this solicitation exceed 3 years?
<p><strong>ANSWER 3:</strong>&nbsp; No, the warranty period is 3 years.</p>
<br /><strong>___________________________________________________________<br />THE SOLICITATION ATTACHMENT IS HEREBY AMENDED TO REFLECT THE CORRECT OFFER DUE DATE/LOCAL TIME.&nbsp; QUOTES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN FRIDAY 5 FEBRUARY 2010 AT 12:00PM (EASTERN).&nbsp; ANY QUOTES SUBMITTED AFTER 12:00PM(EASTERN) WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.&nbsp; (3 FEB 2010).<br /><br />____________________________________________________________<br />THE SOLICITATION IS HEREBY AMENDED:&nbsp; (2 FEBRUARY 2010)<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />The NAICS code listed in the solicitation remains the same.&nbsp; However, the size standard for that particular NAICS code is 500 (previously listed as 100).<br /><br /></span>QUESTION 1:&nbsp; </strong>We noticed that item 0005 listed (300) 1.5TB drives.  Since Hitachi doesn't seem to manufacture a 1.5TB drive, would Seagate or Western Digital 1.5TB be okay?<strong><br /><br />ANSWER 1:&nbsp; </strong>The solicitation does not state brand name so the vendor is free to submit any brand that meets the specification.<strong><br /><br />QUESTION 2:&nbsp; </strong>The software listed is pretty specific, could (4) similar programs be offered, or are they essential to this order?<br /><br /><strong>ANSWER 2:&nbsp; </strong>Software substitutions are acceptable as long as it provides similar or same performance as listed.  <br /><br /><strong><br />_____________________________________________________________<br />The desciption is hereby modified in paragraph to change the Federal Acquisition Circular number from 05-32 to 05-38 (2 February 2010).<br /><br /></strong>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (2 FEBRUARY 2010)</strong></span></p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br /></strong></span><strong>QUESTION 1:&nbsp;</strong> The Oxford 924 chipset is specified. Would it be acceptable to propose a solution using the Oxford 934 chipset which provides the same function and greater performance?<br /><br /><strong>ANSWER 1:</strong>&nbsp; As long as it meets the needs of the minimum specification (the Oxford 924 chipset), newer technology is acceptable.<br /><strong><br />QUESTION 2:</strong>&nbsp; The solicitation specifies a 3.5" HDD for all capacity models. For the 320GB, 500GB, and 750GB it would be possible to utilize 2.5" HDD's which would result in: (a) a significantly smaller package for those capaciities, while maintaining the same performance, and (b) allow for the unit to be powered by the computer or laptop without the need for an external power supply. Would such a solution be acceptable/desireable?<br /><strong><br />ANSWER 2:</strong>&nbsp;  The 3.5" HDD is the industry standard enclosure size. One of the benefits of having a consistent size is the ability to stack multiple drives. This proposed solution is not acceptable or desirable.<br /><strong><br />QUESTION 3:</strong>&nbsp; The current solicitation specifies USB 2.0 and USB 1.1. Would a solution with USB 3.0 be acceptable? USB 3.0 provides a 300% improvement in data transfer rate and is also backwards compatible with USB 1.1 and USB 2.0.<br /><strong><br />ANSWER 3:&nbsp;</strong> USB 3.0 is acceptable as it is backward compatible with USB 2.0 and 1.1, but please keep in mind that all external hard drives must have a quad interface capability (USB, ESATA, FireWire400 and FireWire800).<br /><br /> <br /><br />_____________________________________________________________________<br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

<p dir="ltr">Do you have any supplemental information regarding the burst sampling requirement?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reply:&nbsp; We do not have supplemental information on burst sampling.&nbsp; What we need is a sensor that can be deployed for an extended amount of time and collect measurements without an analyst being present. For example, a sensor that can deployed on a buoy for 3 weeks, be programmed to sample hourly (where it automatically turns on, warms up, collects measurements for 2 minutes and then averages the values), and either stores it internally or has the capability to upload it to an external data collection unit.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>*NOTE:  This is a pre-solicitation notice, not a solicitation. The solicitation HAS NOT yet been issued. Solicitation will not be issued until after February 8, 2010.  Once issued, the solicitation will provide a closing date of 30 days after the issue date.

RFP SPM1C1-10-R-0062 will be for the purchase of T-Shirt, IPFU, Long Sleeve.  
NSN: 8415-01-465-7362(S). CRFD/PD 99-02B.

Description:
Indefinite Delivery Type Contract with Base Term, plus Four (4) One Year Term Options. 

The following Indefinite Delivery Type Contract (IDTC) is anticipated:

This information is for solicitation SPM1C1-10-R-0062. The item is T-Shirt, IPFU, Long Sleeve.  NSN: 8415-01-465-7362(S)  CRFD/PD 99-02B, date is listed as September 13, 2000.  The purchase quantity for the base year and four option periods is a Minimum of 129,984 EA and a Maximum of 649,920 EA, with an AEQ of 519,936.  The first delivery order is due 120 days after the date of the award.  The destination for the item is VSEQ Lion Vallen, Suffolk, VA. 


CAUTION NOTICE

In the past, most Best Value Clothing and Textile solicitations utilized Best Value Trade Off Procedures, however, this acquisition is utilizing the Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Best Value Method.  As such, no "trade off" applies and the Government intends to award to the low priced firm who is compliant with terms of the solicitation, and deemed "technically acceptable."  Also, unlike previous acquisitions for commercial items, there will be no allowable re-submittals for PDM and only firms with satisfactory or better PDMs will be eligible for award.  Technical Acceptability is being defined herein as satisfactory, very good or exceptional PDMs.  All PDMs will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria outlined in the solicitation.  

From among technically acceptable firms, the Government will then select the lowest price offeror and determine if that firm is responsible, complies with terms and conditions of the solicitation and an award to them is in the best interest of the Government.  If that firm fits these criteria, award will be made to them.  If not, the Government will review each subsequent technically acceptable low priced offer until one is identified that does meet the criteria, in which case award will be made to that firm.

The Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations with a competitive range group of offerors from among technically acceptable firms, based on price.  If negotiations are conducted, award will be made to low priced offer (based on final proposal revision closing, date/time) that is technically acceptable, responsible and compliant with solicitation terms and conditions.   
 

 Solicitation will be issued as a Total Small Business Set Aside utilizing the Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Best Value Method.  Successful offeror(s) will be awarded the entire contract, therefore, offeror must offer on base year and all option years.  

Availability of solicitations, FAR 5.102(d) applies, as our office no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.    Offeror should register to receive notification of this solicitation or solicitation amendments.  Copies of this solicitation can be found on the DIBBS website at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/  AFTER  February 8, 2010.  From the DIBBS homepage, select "RFP/IFBs" from the main heading toolbar. Then choose the RFP you wish to view. You must be registered in order to download RFPs. If you are not, you will be directed to register at time of download. In order to ensure e-mail notification of RFPs, prospective vendors MUST go to the DIBBS homepage and select Vendor Registration. The solicitations will be in a downloadable, printable format when viewed with an Adobe Acrobat Reader. Free software is available at http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html.  Gateway technical assistance is available at admin_support@pgmail.daps.mil.    NOTE:  To be eligible for award, potential contractor must be registered with DoD Central Contractor Registration.  You may register via the internet at www.ccr.gov.

DSCP has developed a web-based system that allows manufacturers the ability to request specifications, patterns and drawings on our contracting page.  To request technical data for DSCP Clothing and Textiles (DSCP C&T) solicitations, use the following link to the DSCP C&T Technical Data Repository area at: http://www.dscp.dla.mil/Portal/sreqfrm.aspx.  It is the responsibility of the contractors to access this website and place the request for specifications and patterns.

The Defense appropriations and authorization acts and other statutes (including what is commonly referred to as “The Berry Amendment”) impose restrictions on the DoD’s acquisition of foreign products and services.  Generally, Clothing and Textile items (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7012) and components thereof, must be grown, reprocessed, reused, or produced in the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, unless one of the DFARS 225.7002-2 exceptions applies.

<DESC>Additional FAQ:
Q:  Do I need my feller buncher for the logging out item?
A:  No, a feller buncher is not the right equipment for this job.  This will be a brushing job.  Whole log chippers are not useful.  Some of the common tools will not work on this road brushing contract.

Additional Information:  Response date 2/9/10 at 2 pm, Pacific Time.
No additional maps will be posted but following is additional, pertinent information:

There have been several fires in the areas covered by this contract (Basin, Chalk, Indians, Day, and Zaca).  Areas where fires have burned contain material that is hardened and therefore harder to cut with a chainsaw than the typical standing live or dead.

North coast ridge and central coast ridge roads typically have a 6-foot growth per year (typical of coastal areas) and generally there is old standing dead, hardened, some of which may have fallen into the roadway or on top of new brush growth.

Interior fire areas have yearly growth of brush at about 3-feet/year since the fire occurrence.  Same scenario with standing dead, hardened material and fallen material.

Santa Barbara Ranger District
--Entire Buckhorn Road is fire hardened brush material with re-growth from the last fire of 3-6 feet.

Mt Pinos Ranger District 
--Grade Valley has a component of fir with hardened dead fir due to the Day fire.
--Other areas mostly brush 3-6 feet tall.

Areas outside the recent fire areas are a more solid mass of brush with vines (blackberries, poison oak) and thickened brush nothing more than eight inches in diameter in these stands of brush.  Sometimes there is a scattered tree component that would either take a pole saw with an arm (if hand work) and regular chainsaws, not major tree work, mostly brush work.

The tallest brush in non-fire areas and on coastal roads is approx. 20 feet tall.

The majority of the roads are dirt, very few are paved, less than a ¼ are chip sealed.

This publication represents an opportunity for interested parties to participate in the development of a major acquisition vehicle before its finalized release.

CONTRACT INFORMATION</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">:<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">a. General</strong>: This proposed contract is for Architect-Engineer (A-E) staffing support for Construction phase Services (CPS) which will be procured in accordance with PL-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and implemented in FAR Part 36.6. <br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />The proposed A-E contract will primarily support the engineering/design of various projects primarily located in the Fort Worth District Offices located in Ft Worth, TX CPS for various military and some Civil Works projects which are generally within, but not limited to the Southwestern Division (SWD) regional boundaries (TX, LA, NM, AR, OK) to allow the flexibility of sharing capacity with other Corps Districts (outside SWD boundaries) and other Federal agencies in unique cases. This flexibility would only be exercised in unique cases (anticipate less than 10%). North American Industrial Classification System Code applicable to this project is 541330, Engineering Services, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts and corresponds to SIC Code 8711. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">This announcement is open to businesses regardless of size. Contract Award Procedure: If a large business firm is selected for this announcement it must comply with the FAR 52.219-9 clause regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The subcontracting goals for the Fort Worth District which will be considered in the negotiation of this acquisition are: (1) at least 70% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses (SB); (2) at least 6.2% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with small disadvantaged businesses (SDB); (3) at least 7% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with women-owned SB (WOSB); (4) at least .9% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with service-disabled veteran-owned SDVOSB; (5) at least 9.8% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with HUBZone SB. The plan is not required as part of this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal if a large firm is selected for negotiations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The prime A-E may rely on the written representation (self certification) of subcontractors regarding small disadvantaged business status.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />Anticipated contract award will be on or about May, 2010. One Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract will be awarded from this announcement for a cumulative amount of $25,000,000 with a Minimum Guarantee amount of $5,000.00 for the Base period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There will be a base period of 2 years with one option for a 3 year period.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />Only Architect or Engineering firms may compete for this contract per FAR 36.601-4(b).<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />Price will not be used as a criterion for selection. <br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />There will be NO design services included in this contract that the AE firm will provide as an A-E firm in their offices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The design will be accomplished by the individuals hired under this contract and will be working in the Corps of Engineers offices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a staffing contract, not a design contract.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />Notice Organizational Conflict of Interest. The work to be performed may create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest on future acquisitions. Offerors should refer to FAR subpart 9.5 - ORGANIZATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. An organizational conflict of interest </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">can arise when a contractor possesses an economic incentive that renders it unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial assistance or advice; or an unfair competitive advantage in obtaining a contract as the result of access to nonpublic information about a competitor or procurement. When an organizational conflict of interest arises it can have serious implications for the contractor that can range from disclosure obligations to disqualification from an award. Accordingly, some restrictions on the future activities of the contractor and its subcontractors may be required. And, these restrictions may include prohibiting the contractor or its subcontractors from participating in a contract or a task order. A contractor which participates in preparing design drawings or documents for future construction contracts may be prohibited from providing CPS for that contract. However, in future procurements, the contractor or its subcontractors may request a determination of its ability to participate in a particular procurement from the Contracting Officer. Proposals submitted for procurements or services for which the contractor or its subcontractor is later determined to have an organizational conflict of interest shall be submitted at the risk of the contractor or its subcontractors</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">.<br /></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br />b.

North American Industrial Classification System Code applicable to this project is 541330, Engineering Services, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts and corresponds to SIC Code 8711.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">There will be NO design services included in this contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Notice Organizational Conflict of Interest. The work to be performed may create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest on future acquisitions. Offerors should refer to FAR sub-part 9.5 - ORGANIZATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. An organizational conflict of interest </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">can arise when a contractor possesses an economic incentive that renders it unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial assistance or advice; or an unfair competitive advantage in obtaining a contract as the result of access to nonpublic information about a competitor or procurement. When an organizational conflict of interest arises it can have serious implications for the contractor that can range from disclosure obligations to disqualification from an award. Accordingly, some restrictions on the future activities of the contractor and its subcontractors may be required. And, these restrictions may include prohibiting the contractor or its subcontractors from participating in a contract or a task order. A contractor which participates in preparing design drawings or documents for future construction contracts may be prohibited from providing CPS for that contract. However, in future procurements, the contractor or its subcontractors may request a determination of its ability to participate in a particular procurement from the Contracting Officer. Proposals submitted for procurements or services for which the contractor or its subcontractor is later determined to have an organizational conflict of interest shall be submitted at the risk of the contractor or its subcontractors.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">b. Nature of Work: The services necessary for each requirement will be negotiated and awarded as individual task orders. The Architect-Engineer (A-E) shall furnish all personnel, services, materials, supplies and supervision required to fully complete each task order. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">c. Contract Award Procedure: </span></p>

The boat will be fitted with all equipment necessary for multi-beam hydrographic work in the Pacific Ocean, and the price will include delivery and training.<br /><br />Estimated Cost Range is $500,000 $1,000,000.00. <br /><br />This Procurement will be conducted under FSC CODE: 1940, NAICS Code 336612 Boat Building. The size standard for this code is 500 employees. <br /><br />The acquisition method is negotiated procurement. Both a technical proposal and a price proposal will be required. The basis for award is Best Value Tradeoff. <br />This process permits tradeoffs among costs or price and non-cost factors and allows the Government to award to a superior offeror which is not the lowest priced offer but which is significantly more technically advantageous than the lowest price offeror so as to justify payment of a higher price. In making this determination all evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are significantly more important than cost or price. It is the Governments intent to award based on initial offers without discussions. The offeror chosen will design and build the hydrographic survey boat. Evaluation factors may consist of the following: Past Performance on projects similar in nature; Experience on projects similar in nature; Key Personnel; Schedule. The aforementioned evaluation factors may not be all inclusive.<br /><br />Sub-contracting plans are required for all supply contracts awarded to a large business when the award amount exceeds $550,000.00. If the offeror is a large business, the firm will be required to submit a sub-contracting plan as part of their proposal package. The plan shall be prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. Failure to submit an acceptable sub-contracting plan may make the bidder ineligible for award of the contact. To be acceptable, the plan must adequately address the six required statutory elements and provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to answer affirmatively questions A through H of appendix DD, Part 2, AFARS 19.705. The Los Angeles District subcontracting goals are specific percentages of the contractors total planned subcontract amount. The goals are as follows: 70% with small business; 6.2% with small disadvantaged business; 7.0% with woman owned small business; .9% with service disabled veteran owned small business; 3.0% with veteran-owned small business and 9.8% with hub zone small business. All interested contractors are reminded that the successful contractor will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent with small and disadvantaged firms in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507. <br /><br />ALL OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS. <br /><br />DOWNLOADING SOLICITATION: The solicitation will be available on or about 29 JAN 2010.

<DESC>SUMMARY OF CHANGES<BR><BR><BR>A.	This amendment is issued to make the following changes to Standard Form 33, section L and section M as listed below. As a result of this amendment, the hour and date specified for receipt of Offers is not extended and remains February 17, 2010. <BR><BR>1.	Standard Form 33<BR>a.	Block 12 is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:<BR>In compliance with the above, the undersigned agrees, if this offer is accepted on or prior to July 31, 2010, to furnish any or all items upon which prices are offered at the price set opposite each item, delivered at the designated point(s), within the time specified in the schedule.  <BR>2.	Section L  Instructions to Offerors<BR>a.	Section L.1.13 is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:<BR>The Offerors proposal shall be valid through July 31, 2010.  <BR>3.	Section M  Evaluation Factors for Award<BR><BR>a.	Section M.1.1 General Basis for Contract Award is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:<BR><BR>M.1.1. GENERAL BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD - This will be a competitive source selection and contract award is based on a determination of Best Value to the Government (See FAR 15.101), to include the tradeoff process as described in FAR 15.101-1.  This determination is based on an integrated assessment of ratings for Evaluation Factors (Section M.3.2.), Proposal Risk rating (Section M.2.1 and M.3.3.2), and Performance Risk rating (Section M.2.2 and M.3.3.3) Offeror(s) shall be responsible under the FAR procedures and shall submit proposals conforming to the solicitation requirements. The Government intends to select the source whose offer is most overall advantageous to the Government; however, the Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals and to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposal(s) submitted and the availability of funds. The Government reserves the right to conduct written or oral discussions and surveys as it deems necessary or appropriate before contract award. <BR><BR>The proposals shall be complete, shall arrive by the date and time indicated, and shall be compliant with all instructions. The Offeror shall refer to Section L (Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors) for proposal preparation.<BR><BR>It is anticipated that only one award will be made as a result of this Request for Proposal (RFP)<BR><BR>b.	Section M.2.2 Performance Risk is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:<BR><BR><BR>M 2.2. PERFORMANCE RISK - Performance risk assesses the Offerors ability to successfully complete relevant technical and management/risk identification efforts on time and within costs, and includes the Offerors performance record (Past Performance), if applicable and other information available on contractor responsibility (as defined in FAR Part 9). Overall performance risk will be assigned after completing Cost and Technical proposal reviews. A risk rating of Low (L), Moderate (M), and High (H) will be assessed (M.3.3.3). In those instances where there is insufficient Past Performance record for evaluation, the risk rating will be provided a neutral rating and, unless the Government otherwise learns of reasons to find a high level of risk, a moderate risk rating shall be used for the integrated assessment to cost and technical factors.  <BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract. The Launch Test Squadron (LTS), 3548 Aberdeen Ave SE Bldg. 415, Kirtland AFB 87117 anticipates the issuance of a five-year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a five-year option to Spaceport Systems International (SSI) in support of the Spaceports 3 program. As a result of market research, responses to the sources sought notice issued 19 June 08, and synopsis issued 25 March 09 only Spaceport Systems International (SSI), Alaska Aerospace Corporation (AAC), Space Florida (SF), and Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) were determined capable of providing the required spaceport support . The basis for this sole source action was FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), only a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. A Class J&amp;A authorizing sole source negotiations with the above listed contractors was signed on 24 Feb 09 and was posted to FBO on 5 Oct 09. Additional market research will be conducted prior to exercising the aforementioned option period. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Any responsible persons or companies interested in providing subcontracting opportunities are to respond to the requirements and submit their capability statement, proposal, or quotation to the above listed contractor. The purpose of the spaceports program is to provide enhanced capability and flexibility in commercial spaceport services in order to meet a wide variety of mission requirements for LTS's multi-stage orbital and sub-orbital vehicles. "Spaceport 3" contractors will be required to provide launch site operations support, range/range integration support, logistics support, facility engineering and utilization, and program support. The Government will not reimburse respondents for the cost of submitting information in response to this notice.

<DESC>RECOVERY – THIS POST-AWARD NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO PRESIDIO NETWORKED SOLUTIONS, INC. FOR THE REASONS DESCRIBED BELOW.

In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, Pub.L. 111-5, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) posts this notice of issuance of modification 0025 to Delivery Order 0731 of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) that was awarded to Presidio Networked Solutions, Inc. for the consolidated purchase of various International Business Machine (IBM) software licenses and maintenance.  This purchase will provide an additional 47 Millions of Service Units (MSU), upgraded license capacity and maintenance through September 30, 2010, to IBM software the IRS already owns.  In meeting the spirit of ARRA, the modification has been executed as a firm-fixed price action to a previously competed BPA awarded to Presidio Networked Solutions, Inc., a small business.

These upgrades are needed to support new workloads in the IRS mainframe environment.  Mission critical tax applications will be affected by the changes implemented by the ARRA such that increased workload volumes and changes will require additional processing resources.  The increased workloads include processing new Business Master File (BMF) tax forms and handling increased volumes of queries to support customer interactions with the IRS for other tax application systems.  This acquisition will provide the software licenses and maintenance for the additional processor capacity required to process the new workloads.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION: This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars and is awarded under Contract No. HHSN261200800001E with SAIC-Frederick, Inc., the Operations and Technical Support contract for NCI-Frederick. The Contractor's DUNS number is 159990456.
<p>The purpose of this action is to fund the following ARRA projects:</p>
<p>Molecular Characterization and Assay Development Center - This program will accelerate the identification of molecular changes in tumors and support the development of clinical assays needed to translate these findings to clinical practice.</p>
<p>Clinical Pharmacodynamics - Clinical Pharmacodynamics is accelerating development of assays that will test how a drug is affecting specific molecular targets which will lead to improved cancer therapies.</p>
<p>Justification for Non-Fixed Price Type of Award: This award is priced as an "Other Than Fixed Price" action. Work assigned to SAIC-Frederick, Inc. is pursuant to the terms and conditions of Contract No. HHSN261200800001E, a cost-plus-award-fee prime contract for operations and technical support to the NCI-Frederick. The use of a separate fixed price award to SAIC-Frederick, Inc. is not appropriate because this is Research and Development work issued under an existing cost reimbursement contract.</p>
<p>Justification for Noncompetitive Award: This ARRA funded award is being made as a within scope modification to an existing contract awarded noncompetitively to SAIC-Frederick, Inc. pursuant to a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition signed by the DHHS Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Management and Policy on January 17, 2007.</p>

<DESC>Under the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), the Indian Health Service has received special funding for Health Information Technology (HIT) projects.  The Indian Health Service (IHS) is the principal federal health care provider and health advocate for Indian people and provides a comprehensive health services delivery system for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). IHS provides comprehensive health services through a system of Federal (direct) Indian Health Service, Tribal, and Urban (I/T/U) operated facilities and programs.  These I/T/Us provide health services to 1.7 million American Indians and Alaska Natives through 144 Service Units composed of more than 500 direct healthcare delivery facilities.  The range of services includes traditional inpatient and ambulatory care and extensive preventive care. Facilities are in both urban and rural areas.  Efforts focus toward health promotion and disease prevention activities, as well as the delivery of appropriate clinical care. 

IHS recognizes that health information technology is intrinsic to the success of its ability to serve the American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations for whom it was created.  The role of the Office of Information Technology (OIT) is to manage all technology elements for the IHS, including telecommunications, network (LAN/WAN), security, data warehouse (NPIRS), and Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) development, deployment, and support.  

VistA Imaging (VI) supplies the multimedia component that completes the functionality of the RPMS Electronic Health Record.  VI enables EHR users to view scanned documents and clinical images (photos, radiographs, etc.) that are linked to a patient's electronic record.  It also provides Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) capabilities for the long-term storage of images.

The VistA Imaging application was written by VA and has been certified by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) as a medical device.  This FDA certification encompasses both the VistA Imaging application and the hardware/software configurations that make up the VistA Imaging operating environment

Indian Health Service (IHS) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are in collaborative agreement for the use and implementation of VistA Imaging for electronic image capture, storage, and retrieval.  IHS implemented their first VistA Imaging system at the Portland Area Office in 2006, followed by the Nashville Area Office, Billings Area Office, Phoenix Area Office, and several tribal sites in Oklahoma and Alaska. The IHS has purchased its VistA Imaging equipment from Hewlett-Packard (HP) which is approved to sell the FDA approved hardware configuration.  IHS currently has break/fix maintenance service through the HP Customer Support Center (CSC).  The CSC can perform hardware diagnosis and dispatch local HP engineers with parts, but does not have knowledge of the VistA Imaging infrastructure.  

The primary objective of this fixed price order is to obtain VistA Imaging infrastructure support services to augment the hardware maintenance of IHS VistA Imaging systems.

This order was awarded using a limited sources justification.  The rationale for the limitation on competition is the VistA Imaging hardware and software platforms have been certified as a medical device by the FDA.  Therefore, there are very specific requirements concerning the types of equipement and configurations that must be used for scanning, storing, and archiving images.  The FDA requires that vendors pursuing certification go through the Veteran Administrations' validation process.  Currently, Hewlett Packard is the only vendor that has completed the validation processa nd is certified to provide hardware, installation, and maintenance services for VistA Imaging.

<DESC>Reference is made to Solicitation No. W912DQ-09-R-0013 and Contract No. W912DQ-10-D-3013, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract for Environmental Compliance and Remediation Services.  The Government intends to make an award to a fourth firm, thereby increasing the number of firms, from three to four, under this multiple award contract.  The four firms will share the Joint Total Acquisition Value of $25 Million.  This fourth award will be to HDR|e2M.<BR><BR>The proposal submitted by e2M in March 2009, in response to the subject solicitation, was highly rated by the Source Selection Evaluation Board.  As a result of e2Ms change of ownership, announced in June 2009, the Contracting Officer considered e2M to be ineligible for an award under the subject solicitation.  Subsequent to the award of three contracts to three other firms in November 2009, e2M filed a protest and requested that a size determination be made by the Small Business Administration (SBA).  According to the formal size determination rendered by the SBA on December 16, 2009 (see attached), the company HDR|e2M was determined to be eligible for an award under the subject solicitation.  Since the proposal submitted by e2M was highly rated; and since the SBA has ruled that the firm HDR|e2M is eligible for award under the subject solicitation, the Government has elected to make this fourth award.<BR><BR>Should you have any questions regarding this issue, please contact Heather Morrow, Contract Specialist, at heather.n.morrow@usace.army.mil or 816-389-3320.  <BR><BR><BR>ATTACHMENT:<BR>Small Business Administration Size Determination, Case #05-2010-025, dated Dec 16, 2009<BR>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />The Reference Number is F1M3E39313AQ01. The 437th Contracting Squadron, 101 E. Hill Blvd., Charleston AFB SC, requires an analysis and report or recommendations for the repair of a specially designed Telescoping Mast Service Platform (TMP) Lift at the Civil Engineering Squadron.</p>
<p>The 437th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to ASC Aero Systems Corporation, 220 NE 46th ST, OKLAHOMA CITY, OK 73105-3306. Market research was performed and information gathered in determining this company to be the only reliable source for this requirement in the US.</p>
<p>Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read: The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to response to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by the appointed due date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposal based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The justification for the sole source requirements as follows:</p>
<p>The TMPs in Building 515 were designed specifically for that building and mission and are "one of a kind". ASC Aero Systems Corporation possesses exclusive knowledge to inspect and repair these uniquely designed TMPs; their unique working knowledge in the commercial sector makes them the only known contractor capable of performing the inspection.</p>
<p>ASC Aero Systems Corporation is the only known source that can satisfy the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to search the market for vendors who can provide services that will fulfill the TMP inspection and repair requirements.</p>
<p>The following provisions and/or clauses apply to this acquisition. Offerors must comply with all instructions contained in FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items. FAR 52.203-3 Gratuities. FAR52.203-6 Alt I Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government Alt I. FAR 52.204-4 Printed Copied Double-Sided or Recycled paper.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has an urgent requirement to purchase Galley Food Services Support for an estimated cost of $74,000. The USCG intends to utilize services provided by TW and Company Inc. for the Telecommunication and Information Systems Command (TISCOM) Base in Alexandria, VA 22315-3940. Food Services Support for the Base Galley at TISCOM have been provided for the US Coast Guard by an 8(a) company, TW and Company, under procedures established by the Small Business Administration (SBA). The final option year was not exercised due to administrative error, and additional time (up to 60 days) is required to establish a replacement 8(a) contract under the current Partnership Agreement between SBA and DHS. This short term bridge contract enables the contract to be returned to the 8 (a) program as quickly as possible.
