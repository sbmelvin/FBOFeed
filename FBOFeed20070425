<DESC>The Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Program (AFP) is a nationwide law enforcement program that operates as an effective and powerful weapon in the fight against crime.  The principal mission of the Program is to ensure that the forfeiture of the assets of criminals remains an effective deterrent to crime.  Federal employees, contract personnel, and state and local law enforcement officials work cooperatively in investigating and prosecuting cases involving asset seizure and forfeiture to support the Program's mission.  The Department requires assistance in professional investigative, analytical, and technical support services for the administrative management functions within AFP.  These functions consist of management of the Department's Assets Forfeiture Fund (AFF), including interpretation of the AFF statute; management and operation of the Consolidated Asset Tracking System (CATS); management of both internal and external budget processes regarding AFF monies; managing investment of AFF and Seized Assets Deposit Fund (SADF) surplus balances; development, administration and oversight of asset forfeiture program-wide contracts; review, audit, and evaluation of asset forfeiture program activities; identification of program weaknesses and development, monitoring, and review of appropriate internal controls; and analysis of legislative, policy, and regulatory proposals that may affect the execution of the Asset Forfeiture Program.      

The Government contemplates award of up to three (3) awards on an unrestricted competitive basis.  The contract will be available for use by the Department and other federal agencies on an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity task order basis for a base year and six (6) one-year options.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541611 with a size standard of $6.5M.  Due to the nature of the work performed, Secret and Top Secret clearances are required of the majority of contractor personnel and companies must have Top Secret Facility Security Clearance at the time of proposal submission.  

The solicitation document DJJR-07-RFP-0462 will be available early May, 2007 and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's FedBizOpps web site www.FedBizOpps.gov.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources to provide technical and programmatic support for the National Airspace System Defense Program (NDP).  This is the follow-on to Contract DTFAAC-07-C-00016. The anticipated period of performance is for one base period, with up to four (4) 12-month option periods.  The base period is expected to begin 1 Oct 2007 and continue through 30 Sep 2008. At present there are three duty locations.  The two duty locations where services currently are being performed are the FAA NDP office located in Washington DC and Egg Harbor Township, NJ.  The third on-site location is in Oklahoma City, OK and in the future, support may be required for this location. The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors.  At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.

<RESPDATE>042607
<ARCHDATE>05262007
<CONTACT>Kevin Dillon, (609) 485-6911
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to increase the amount of subcontracting effort under contract DTFACT-04-C-00014 with All Star Maintenance, Inc. BACKGROUND Contract DTFACT-04-C-00014 is for the Operations and Maintenance Services, both new work and alterations, for both FAA William J Hughes Technical Center owned and tenant-owned facilities. Contract DTFACT-04-C-00014 is for operations and maintenance services, new work and alterations, for both FAA WJHTC owned and tenant-owned facilities.  The contract covers plumbing and fire suppression systems, site utilities, heating and air-conditioning systems, fire detection and alarm systems, electrical distribution systems (primary and secondary, including substations), elevators, roofing, cafeteria equipment, interior and exterior finishes, central utility plants, water treatment plant and wells, motor vehicle and equipment maintenance, material handling, grounds maintenance, roads and parking lot pavement, snow removal, hazardous waste removal, bulk trash removal and disposal, pest control, radio system, security cameras and card readers, intrusion detection systems, and industrial cleaning.  The contract is a hybrid of firm-fixed-price (FFP) work, option items (namely support to tenants), IDIQ work (above-and-beyond work from the FFP work), and cost-plus work.  The total contract value at the time of award was approximately $45,000,000 and all bid evaluations were on the total amount bid for the five-year term.  Due to the increased rates in Department of Labor (DOL) for Service Contract Act services, and Davis Bacon Act type services, the contract is now approximately $50,000,000. The Subcontracting Effort for the above contract was awarded at an estimate $150,000 per Fiscal year.  Based on the actual requirements necessary to support the subject requirement, it is necessary to increase the estimate subcontracting effort to $1,750,000 for FY07, and $1,500,000 for FY08 and FY09.   The increase is to be incorporated into the subject contract on a sole source basis.  As individual IDIQ jobs are proposed, the supporting data is appended to the Work Authorization Form and is subject to QAE, COTR, and CO review and approval.  The contractor maintains a subcontracting program, including working to meet and exceed subcontracting goals to small businesses, woman-owned, and disadvantaged/8A firms. The subcontracting efforts must be coordinated through All Star and are therefore uniquely required to be accomplished through the subject contract vehicle. Any questions should be directed to the Contracting Officer, Kevin Dillon at 609-485-6911 or kevin.dillon@faa.gov.

Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). The estimated cost for this construction project is between $1,000,000.00 - $5,000,000.00.

For this procurement the GSA Project Team shall evaluate all properly received offers consistent with FAR 15.101-2, Lowest price technically acceptable source selection process?.

The GSA Project Team shall utilize the following factors as requirements for acceptability; Factor 1) Firm shall list a minimum of five (5) projects completed in the past five(5) years of a similar scope of work that have a total contract value of at least $1,000,000.00.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is announcing the release of the DRAFT Joint Precision and Approach Landing System (JPALS) System Development and Demonstration (SDD) solicitation without Sections L and M. (Section L and M will be available in approximately 30 days).  This acquisition is being pursued on the basis of full and open competition. Contract award is anticipated in the second quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2008.

This DRAFT SOLICITATION and its attached documents/exhibits will be listed at the website "Doing Business with NAVAIR",  http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations and the Joint Precision and Approach Landing System (JPALS) website, http://pma213.navair.navy.mil/systems/jpals.htm.

JPALS is a Global Positioning System (GPS)-based precision approach and landing system that will replace several aging and obsolete aircraft landing systems with a family of systems that are more affordable, function in more operational environments, and support all Department of Defense (DoD) Land and Sea Based applications.  The National Defense Strategy of the United States of America calls for highly mobile forces that can rapidly respond to crises worldwide.  Success in meeting this challenge requires the ability to land aviation assets virtually anywhere, at any time.  JPALS will provide this capability by being rapidly deployable, survivable and interoperable among the U.S. Services and with our allies, as well as with civil aircraft and landing facilities.  The JPALS capability will be incrementally acquired and incorporated into the DoD inventory of warfighting assets.  Sea Based JPALS has been designated as Increment 1. The program is scheduled for a Milestone B decision in the 2nd Quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 with Sea Based JPALS (Increment 1) Initial Operational Capability (IOC) planned for FY14.

The proposed system architecture will be driven by the requirements and constrained by the program schedule and affordability goals contained in the solicitation and in the JPALS Systems Requirements Document (SRD).

Interested parties can view/download the Draft RFP N00019-07-R-0044) including its attachments.  SOO, *SRD, DD254 and the associated Security Classification Guide, GFE/GFI List and GFI documents, and the Contract Data Requirements List (Data Items A001 through A115).

*Note: Current SRD revision (4) incorporates threshold requirements for Sea Based Increment 1.  An update to SRD revision (4) will include objective performance for availability in a jamming environment and auto land capability.  This update will be forthcoming at this website "Doing Business with NAVAIR" and the JPALS website referenced above.  Further,
SRD revision (5), available in June 2007, will incorporate a Land-Based reference document for growth considerations. 

Exclusive of the above information posted on the NAVAIR website and the JPALS website, potential offerors must request a copy of the JPALS classified Annex A from the Government. Points of contact for the written request are below. The request must include the company name, classified mailing address, CAGE code, e-mail address, Facility Secuirty Officer name and telephone number, and point of contact with telephone number. If requesting the classified section of the SRD, note that the JPALS Annex A are classified as SECRET.  Compact Disc(s) containing a copy of the requested data will be mailed after the Government verifies the requestor's CAGE Code and mailing address for the classified mailing address and level of safeguarding for the classified documents. Hardcopy requests will not be honored. 

THIS IS A DRAFT SOLICITATION.  PROPOSALS ARE NOT TO BE SUBMITTED.  THIS AGENCY IS LOOKING FOR COMMENTS, FEEDBACK, OR QUESTIONS RELATIVE TO THE JPALS PROGRAM AND THIS DRAFT SOLICITATION.  ALL  RESPONSES, DISCUSSIONS AND CORRESPONDENCE MUST BE ADDRESSED DIRECTLY TO THE PCO NO LATER THAN 9 MAY 2007.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 

For all three cranes:  The Contractor shall overhaul two hydraulic hoist assemblies and four hydraulic motors on each crane (for a total of 6 hoist assemblies and 12 hydraulic motors).  The repair shall include inspecting, disassembling, and rebuilding the hoist assemblies and hydraulic motors and complete all other incidental work related to the overhaul.

After the repair work is completed, the Government will transport the hoist assemblies and hydraulic motors back to the Government?s work site.  (Note:  the Government will deliver only the hoist assemblies and hydraulic motors and not the entire cranes).

Parts and Material Limitations.  The Government will provide the Grove hoist assembly overhaul kits for the 6 hoist assemblies only (not for the hydraulic motors).  The Contractor shall provide all other parts and material for the hoist assemblies (beyond the overhaul kits) up to $200 in parts/materials for each hoist assembly.  The Contractor shall provide all parts and material for the hydraulic motors up to $200 in parts/materials for each hydraulic motor.  The Government will not provide overhaul kits for the hydraulic motors.  For unforeseen parts and materials that exceed the limits above, and are needed to complete the overhauls, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer (KO) and the Government may modify the contract to complete the work.

The Contractor shall complete all overhauls 60 calendar days after receiving the hoist assemblies, hydraulic motors, and overhaul kits.  If ordered parts (not included with the overhaul kits) have a long lead time causing delay of the completion time, the Contractor shall notify the Government and provide justification for the parts delivery time.  The Government may extend the completion time.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  intends to award a sole source purchase order to Affymetrix, Sunnyvale, CA 94086, pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)-Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This is for continuation experiment in progress FAR 6.302-1     This procurement is for Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array; Kit two-cycle Cycle DNA Synthesis;    Kit, Two-cycle target labeling and control reagents. With the One-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents, the NIAID- LID Microarray Group will be able to perform a single round amplification from 1?g Total RNA for use on Affymertix Eukaryotic GeneChip? Arrays.     Based on discussions with multiple sales representatives from various companies and internet searches there is no other package on the market that combines all reagents necessary for performing labeling and hybridization for Affymetrix Eukaryotic GeneChip? Arrays with the spike-in control targets.     By purchasing this all-in-one kit from Affymetrix quality control, lot variation, and expiration of reagents are all controlled yielding higher quality data for the NCT. 
With the Two-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents, the NIAID-LID Microarray Group will be able to perform a double round amplification from 10?g Total RNA for use on Affymertix Eukaryotic GeneChip? Arrays.     This low amount of starting material is ideal for Laser Capture Microdiscetion studies that are ongoing at NIAID.     Based on discussions with multiple sales representatives from various companies and internet searches there is no other package on the market that combines all reagents necessary for performing labeling and hybridization for Affymetrix Eukaryotic GeneChip? Arrays with the spike-in control targets.     Each kit contains 1 each of: IVT labeling kit, Two-cycle cDNA synthesis kit, Sample clean-up module, Poly-A RNA Control Kit & Hybridization Controls.     By purchasing this all-in-one kit from Affymetrix quality control, lot variation, and expiration of reagents are all controlled yielding higher quality data for the LID. 
The Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array is 30 packs of GeneChip? Arrays for covering the entire mouse genome.     These arrays are the only arrays that can be used in the Affymetrix GeneChip? system (consisting of hybridization oven, fluidics station, and laser scanner).     Affymetrix high-density probe arrays can offer oligo densities as high as 106 per cm2.     This high density feature is unique to Affymetrix and covered by patents, USP Nos. 5,445,934 and 5,744,305 as well as others.     Typically, Affymetrix produces arrays with over 1,000,000 probe locations, or features, within 1.28 square centimeters.     Each individual feature harbors millions of DNA molecules.     High probe density allows for the generation of a maximum amount of robust data with a single microarray.     This minimizes sample requirements and simplifies prep work and data analysis.     Also, Affymetrix?s photolithographic manufacturing technology enables consistent reproduction of probe array designs and reduces variation inherent in less sophisticated array manufacturing technologies.     This feature is unique to Affymetrix and covered by patents USP Nos. 5,424,186 and 5,510,270 as well as others. The NIAID LID currently has an Affymetrix system and by patents only Affymetrix GeneChips     can be used with the system.     The one and two cycle labeling kits have been used in NIAID for two years now and using other labeling technologies would compromise ongoing experiments and compromise the integrity of data flowing into the CEBS database.
All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 10 days of date of notice to Jemal Williams at the above address for consideration by the agency.     Faxed responses will be accepted at 301-480-3695.       Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.     Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.     If no affirmative responses are received within 10 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Affymetrix.     The NAICS code/size is 339111/500 employees.     This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.     There is no solicitation package available.     For information concerning this solicitation contact Jemal Williams, FAX 301-480-3695.****

Assessment of the Impact of Public Access Computing at Public Libraries

Posting for Federal Business Opportunities


Contracting Office Address: 
Institute of Museum and Library Services, Office of the Director, 1800 M St., NW 9th floor, Washington, DC 20036

Description: 

The Institute of Museum and Library Services helps builds the capacity of the nation?s museums and libraries through grants, convenings, research and communications.  The Institute provides resources for museums and libraries to sustain our cultural heritage, foster learning and innovation, and build professional capacity.  The Institute is authorized to undertake research on national trends of museum and library services and to report on the impact and effectiveness of services provided by museums and libraries.  In 2007, IMLS will oversee a study of the impact on individuals, families, and communities of public access computing services provided at public libraries throughout the United States.  Public access computing is defined here as free access to computers and the Internet through public libraries and to the services that public libraries provide to help patrons use computers and find online information they need.  The study seeks to document the value that access to computers and information brings for the social, economic, personal, and professional well-being of individuals and communities across the nation.  For many, the library provides the preferred, and sometimes only, means of access to services and information to help find a job, help with homework, obtain health, medical, or financial information, connect with family, or submit online forms.  The study intends to identify a set of indicators to measure the beneficial impact where public access computing is present, and conversely, the negative impact where access is low or weak.  IMLS is conducting the study with the support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  

IMLS expects that the study will focus on key areas of specific impact (e.g., education, economic development, health literacy, immigrant acculturation, and social connectness) and that the offeror will identify appropriate levels of measurement and sampling methods for the data collection and analysis. IMLS encourages eligible organizations to partner or collaborate in response to this solicitation. The findings of the study will assist in allocation and distribution of resources, development of technology strategies, and the evaluation of technology plans, and will be of value to community planners; federal, state and local governments; policy makers; information specialists; and library officials.  IMLS anticipates posting the solicitation on or around January 31, 2007 with a deadline of March 19, 2007, and awarding a contract on or around April 2, 2007.  The study is expected to take one year to complete.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Risk Management Research Center (NRMRL), Sustainable Technology Division (STD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with The Ohio State University Center for Resilience, for the Life Cycle Assessment of the Production and Use of Ethanol from Cellulose.  The current NAICS code is 541710.   The background behind this EPA requirement is as follows: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires a contractor to  conduct research in areas topical to the subject of life cycle environmental assessment.  The topics for the life cycle assessment (LCA) include bio- and alternative-fuels and include thermodynamic and hierarchical analyses, among others.  In particular the life cycle of cellulosic ethanol and  comparison to conventional gasoline is of interest.  Such life cycle studies consider multimedia cradle to grave effects, where resource use and environmental releases have potential negative consequences.   Based on the EPA's knowledge of technical support needed for the Statement of Work (SOW),  The Ohio State University's Center for Resilience is the only known source able to satisfy the Government's requirement.  No known contractor employs the method required to complete this assessment, because Dr. Bakshi, with the Center for Resilience, is the sole developer of this method.  However,  any firm believing itself capable of meeting the EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to  compete the proposed requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The  applicable NAICS code is 541710.  Please submit your request in writing to Scott A. Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov or fax your request to (513) 487-2107.  No telephone requests will be honored.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis for annual software licensing regarding Semi-Custom Synthesis Online Request System (SCSORS) Subsuming and Extending Existing Screening Samples Database, with ChemNavigator 6126 Nancy Ridge Drive, Suite 117, San Diego California 92121.

The supplies and services herein are commercial as described in FAR Part 2 and the supplies and services are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.501.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541511 and the business size standard is $23M employees.  

The proposed requirement is for a software license regarding the current and comprehensive database of commercially accessible drug discovery screening compounds, plus a centralized system to allow researchers to go beyond the samples in such a database by requesting synthesis of analogs from suppliers, in normalized electronic structure format.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) will host the database on its? own servers and the chemical structure data will be made available to NIH researchers to distinguish the stock database from the SCSORS resource.   

The Chemistry Resource provided will be comprised of three major components:  1) Chemical sourcing database; 2) On-line database search and selection system and; 3) Semi-Custom synthesis online request system.    Period of Performance shall be from September 1, 2007 or from date of award, whichever is later, for twelve (12) months with two (2), twelve (12) month options.    
  
The ChemNavigator Chemistry Resource database is unique in its ability to provide aggregate access to both structures and actual purchasable samples from the majority of available sources world-wide.  It is the largest currently available collection of small-molecule screening samples.  The database currently contains more than 19 million unique compounds with a growing tendency.   ChemNavigator, Inc. is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the chemistry resource database and is the largest known database that can provide these unique compounds in one location.

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM ET May 4, 2007.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  Please reference solicitation number NCI-70049-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.

<SOLNBR>W911W6-07-D-0006
<RESPDATE>061107
<ARCHDATE>08102007
<CONTACT>Ceseley A. Dunbar, 757-878-2771
<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) anticipates award of a noncommercial program entitled, 'Composite Tail Components for ARH.' The Armys directed project is to manufacture and initiate qualification of composite tail component(s) for  the Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter (ARH) that replaces the production metallic parts to improve fatique performance, reduce corrosion susceptibility, and reduce weight. The acquisition builds upon previously completed contracted research and development entitled 'Complex Composite Structural Components (CCSC)' conducted by Albany International Techniweave, Inc., now Albany Engineered Composites (AEC).  AATD anticipates award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract on a sole source ba sis to AEC, who is deemed to be the only responsible source uniquely capable of meeting this requirement.  The maximum value of the contract will be $9.9 million.  The contract minimum value of $1 million will be met with award of the first cost-plus-fixed -fee task order.  The funding for this requirement results from a Congressional earmark for carry-over technologies from CCSC to ARH tail components. This requirement is a direct extension of the Armys prior 6.2/ManTech funded project for similar parts on  the YAH-66 Comanche.  The design, materials, and manufacturing methods were successfully developed, integrated and applied to several distinctively new manufacturing technologies to produce structurally flight worthy parts.  Accordingly, this acquisition will be procured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(l), as implemented by  FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as market research has identified AEC as the only source with the text ile technology expertise, injection molding expertise, and relevant, demonstrated experience in applying these expertises to the design and manufacture of close molded composite tail components. The Government deems that substantial duplication of cost inc urred under the previously conducted research cannot be recovered through competition.  No other known source has the equivalent technical maturity to satisfy the Government requirement in the timeframe for which Congressionally earmarked funds were provid ed.  Many of the manufacturing details to be further explored under the planned efforts are proprietary to AEC.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to AEC.  The contract terms and requirements will be dev eloped jointly between the Government and AEC, consistent with alpha contracting procedures in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).   The overall period of performance for the IDIQ contract is sixty (60) months.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 336413 and the size standard is 1,000.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a proposal that shall be considered.  Written proposals should be addr essed to AATD, Attn: AMSRD-AMR-AA-C (Ms.Ceseley Dunbar), Building 401 Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577.  Ms. Dunbars phone number is 757-878-2771.  Anyone desiring an explanation or interpretation of this announcement must request it in writing a t the above address (Fax 757-878-0008) or email address cdunbar@aatd.eustis.army.mil.  Contracting Officer is Ms. Lauren Sebring who can be reached at 757-878-4828 or lsebring@aatd.eustis.army.mil.  Notes 22 and 26 apply.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO:

1. REVISE SECTION H.14, PARAGRAPH (c)to read as attached; and 
2. REVISE SECTION J TO INCLUDE ATTACHMENT 6, 48 CFR SUBPART 2009.5, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE RFP REMAIN UNCHANGED.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) established the Accident Sequence Precursor (ASP) program in 1979. The primary objective of this program was and continues to be the systematic evaluation of the risk-significance of U.S. commercial nuclear power reactor operational events. Under this requirement, the Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) of the NRC will systematically evaluate U.S. nuclear plant operating experience to identify and document the operating events that were most likely to lead to inadequate core cooling and severe core damage (precursors), if additional failures had occurred. Using standardized plant-specific models provided by the NRC, the contractor shall perform detailed risk analyses of events or conditions that have occurred during all phases of reactor operations. Additionally, the contractor shall perform Large Early Release Frequency (LERF) analyses when requested for selected events, again using models provided by the NRC.  The contractor shall also provide on-call probabilistic risk analysis support to NRC staff for regulatory issues. 

It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract. 

The period of performance of the resultant contract will be four (4) years and six (6) months. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about March 26, 2007 and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website. Hard copies of the solicitation document and its related documents, as appropriate, will not be available. Because this solicitation and its related documents, as appropriate, will be posted at this website, interested parties are instructed NOT to send letters or e-mails or faxes requesting the RFP. Telephoned, e-mailed, or faxed requests for the RFP will not be accepted. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. 

The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. 

The size standard for this solicitation is average annual receipts of $4.5 million over the past three years, as set forth under NAICS 541330.  

Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e., large businesses, small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Notice to large businesses: The subcontracting plan requirements of P.L. 95-507 are applicable to this effort.

This sole source is to modify the existing contracts by extending the period of performance by five months (June 14, 2007  through November 13, 2007) and by increasing the total contract ceiling price.  These contracts provide patent-related services including patent searches, patent prosecution, infringement and interference services and licensing consultation to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Technology Transfer (OTT).  The extension for the current contracts will prevent a lapse in service during negotitation and award of multiple contracts under RFP# 263-2006-P(GM)-0247 for Patent Legal Services currently posted on www.fbo.gov.  This action is under the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 as it is impracticable to seek competition for the four month period while completing negotiations under RFP #263-2006-P(GM)-0247.  Interruption of service would result in significant harm to the U.S. Government in the loss of intellectual property rights in the United States and foreign countries in connection with multiple patent cases.

<DESC>The United States Air Force, Headquarters Air Mobility Command (HQ AMC) is seeking sources for the contemplated follow-on contract for the Broadband Satellite Communication (SATCOM) Services.  This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for informational and planning purposes only.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this RFI.  The Air Force will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this request for information.

This FedBizOpps notice is an announcement seeking market information on businesses capable of providing the services as described herein.  AMC is currently conducting market research to determine qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources.  The information requested by this RFI will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency.  Should a future requirement(s) evolve from this preliminary planning process, it is anticipated the period of performance will be a base year plus four one-year option periods.   The incumbent contractor for this effort is Boeing Service Company formally Connexion By Boeing.

This Request for Information (RFI) is provided to the commercial sector for a complete Broadband SATCOM solution which supports providing broadband data rates to the Senior Leader Command, Control, and Communications System - Airborne (SLC3S-A) air fleet, and others as designated, of 18 simultaneous aircraft worldwide with a desire for the number of simultaneous aircraft to increase throughout the contract period.

System will provide world-wide northern hemisphere coverage of the major air routes, at a minimum, with the objective of full world-wide mid-latitude (between 60 deg N and 60 deg S latitude) coverage.  Contractor will provide regulatory licenses and approvals to operate-use the spectrum for countries within the required coverage-service area.  System will be designed to automatically shutdown when the aircraft flies into a restrict zone, and turn back on when exiting that restrict zone.  Coverage-regulatory licenses should allow for use of the system while aircraft are on the ground. The system will provide backhaul of traffic to designated ground stations, currently the Government Air-to-Global Information Grid Gateways (A2G2s) at Andrews AFB MD and McChord AFB WA.  The contractor must be willing to work with the Government to transition commercially-leased services, such as transponders and ground stations, to Government services, to include Department of Defense (DoD) Teleports, throughout the life of the contract.  

The contractor will provide a 24-7-365 Network Operations Center (NOC) that will work with the Government Network Operations Center (GNOC), Communications System Operators (CSOs), Senior Leader Communications Staffs, and other entities as designated to track and monitor system status as well as troubleshoot problems with the system-service.  Support should include 24-7-365 engineering support.  All personnel working with the system and the SLC3S-A air fleet described herein will have a background check and a USG Secret clearance.  

Additionally, a real-time system monitoring tool will be provided to designated personnel for monitoring of capacities, saturation rates, aircraft tracking through satellites, satellite status, and other system information.  The tool will allow designated aircraft to be masked to be seen by only designated personnel.

The information gathered from this RFI will be used, along with other information, to determine both private sector interest and the competition parameters should AMC decide that Engine Management is a viable candidate for an A-76 public-private competition. The information requested by this synopsis will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency.  Should a future requirement evolve from this preliminary planning process, it is anticipated that the period of performance will be a base year plus four one-year option periods.  For purposes of this synopsis the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 488190 and the small business size standard is $6.5M.  AMC requests any qualified businesses that are capable and potentially interested in performing Engine Management services to reply to this RFI stating their interest and submit a capability package to include the following information:  1)  name and address of company; 2) company point of contact including telephone, fax, and email address; 3) identify business size (large, small, disadvantaged,  women-owned, 8 (a), HUBZone, etc); and 4) information demonstrating the companys ability to perform the potential requirement as described above.  In addition, we request that capability packages include your current and past performance contract references relating to Engine Management services to include: contract number; agency or organization supported; whether or not contractor was a prime or a subcontractor; period of performance; original, current, and total contract value; POC (customers technical monitor) with current telephone, fax number and email address; and a brief description of the effort.  Also, provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost for providing nonpersonal services to furnish all labor (e.g., to include direct and indirect labor such as management and supervision), supplies and materials, and overhead (e.g., to include operations and general and administrative overhead) necessary in supporting the EM services function.  The ROM should be an estimated cost per engine type to perform EM at each location for the KC-135 (F108 engine), C-5 (TF39 engine), and C-130 (T56 engine).  The estimated number of engines are 297 - TF39 engines for the C5 between Dover and Travis AFBs, 486 - F108 engines for the KC-135 between Fairchild, Grand Forks, MacDill, McConnell, and Robbins AFBs, and 372 - T56 engines for the C-130 between Pope, Little Rock and Dyess AFBs.  Please limit the capability package to 20 pages.  The capability package must be clear, concise, and complete and be submitted by 10 Feb 2006, 12:00 p.m central via e-mail to Rickey.Mabry@scott.af.mil.  Please refer any questions to the referenced e-mail address or to (618) 256-9964.

B.	Purpose of this Announcement--

NWS is primarily interested in identifying small businesses concerns [including small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, historically underutilized business zone (HUBZone) small businesses, and other small businesses] capable of providing the engineering and operational support services described in the attached Draft Statement of Performance as a prime contractor.  The Government envisions that the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for these services would be 541330, ?Engineering Services,? and that the applicable small business size standard would be $4.5 million average annual receipts.

To demonstrate the ability to provide the required services, the small business concern must be capable of providing the following types of support:

1.  Identify staff personnel with the most appropriate management, administration, engineering, technical and financials skills necessary to accomplish tasks as defined by the Statement of Work.

2.  Proactively work with the NWS program or project office personnel using performance-based metrics to define projects corresponding with, and advancing program and administration goals.

3.  Proactively manage assigned personnel such that the tasks are accomplishing the performance metrics.

4.  Provide monthly earned-value reports of performance progress for each task.  The report should reflect the current definition of earned-value used by the Department of Commerce and be presented in a format that is easily understood by both program and procurement personnel.

Additionally, NWS is interested in identifying small business concerns capable of providing a portion of the required services as a subcontractor.
 
C.	Submitting a Response--

The Government will not be liable for any costs incurred in preparing or submitting a response to this Sources Sought Notice.

1.

Also, NOAA may request further information from one or more respondents to gain further insight into the respondent?s capabilities.  The Government will not be liable for any costs incurred by respondents in these follow-up activities.

<SUBJECT>B--Mid-Decadal Global Land Survey - Request for Information
<SOLNBR>07HQ22-NoSolicitation
<RESPDATE>051007
<ARCHDATE>04242008
<CONTACT>JOANNE LOWE CONTRACT SPECIALIST 7036487392     jlowe@usgs.gov;
<DESC>This is not an announcement of a Solicitation; it is only a Request for Information (RFI), and a request for proposals may or may not result from it. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) needs to assess external capabilities to produce a mid-decadal (circa 2005-2006) global, orthorectified (terrain-corrected) Landsat data set to complement the Landsat 2000 global data set.  In preparation, the USGS is soliciting input from industry in order to assess commercial capabilities to produce the required Landsat image data products for the Mid-Decadal Global Land Survey (MDGLS). Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) gap-filled imagery will be the primary source for the MDGLS data set.  The term "gap-filled" refers to the need to substitute for data that are missing from each Landsat 7 scene as a result of the 2003 failure of the scan line corrector (SLC) device in the ETM+ sensor (approximately 22% of the image data are missing from each Landsat 7 scene acquired since the SLC failure).  To substitute for missing data in one Landsat 7 scene, typically one additional Landsat 7 scene of the same site, from the same season, will be needed to fill in blank areas.  Thus, if the finished MDGLS data set consisted of 9,000 gap-filled Landsat 7 images, at least 18,000 scenes will have been pre-selected and processed.   Where necessary, due to excessive cloud cover or other factors, Landsat 7 ETM+ coverage will be augmented by individual Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes.  It is anticipated that approximately one-third of the MDGLS data set could be made up of TM data. The data specifications for the MDGLS Project are as follows: Geodetic Accuracy Finished MDGLS scenes shall be terrain corrected to a geodetic accuracy of 30m or better net RMSE relative to the Landsat 2000 dataset.  The maximum geodetic error within the MDGLS shall be less than 100m.  Where available and appropriate, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data shall be used for vertical control. Radiometric Correction Both ETM+ and TM data products shall be processed such that each pixel represents a calibrated, at-sensor radiance value linearly scaled to an 8-bit range, equivalent to the USGS Level 1G product (systematically corrected).  Data processing definitions are available at http://eros.usgs.gov/products/satellite/landsat7.html. ETM+ Gap Filled Products Cloud-free MDGLS scenes derived from ETM+ data shall be gap-filled using the USGS/EROS "local linear histogram matching" algorithm on a pair Landsat 7 images acquired during the same season.  Each final Landsat 7 MDGLS product shall include the gap-filled composite together with a mask indicating the extent of the original blank data versus fill data.  The USGS will identify and provide both the base and filler Level 0R (raw uncorrected) Landsat 7 scenes to be combined, plus Level 0R Landsat 5 scenes where necessary. Product Projection Finished MDGLS products shall be in UTM/WGS-84 projection.  For images that include multiple UTM zones, the MDGLS zone shall correspond to that used for the corresponding Landsat 2000 product.   Product Resolution and Resampling Finished MDGLS products shall have a spatial resolution (pixel size) of 14.25m (panchromatic band), 28.5m (reflective multispectral bands), and 57m (thermal band).  Only a single cubic convolution resampling step shall be used during MDGLS processing.

They will provide licensing authorization, technical support via telephone and Web, software upgrades and new releases, replacement of original magnetic media, and certification of authorized licensing.  The estimated value of this procurement is $88,281.54. The Bureau of Human Resources purchased the Business Objects modules as a commercial off-the- shelf product as the software to migrate the US Department of States personnel processing system to a WEB-based system.  Follow-on annual maintenance is required to provide the Bureau authorized licensing and right to use the software.  The Business Objects modules are available commercially; however, the maintenance support and licensing authorization remains with Business Objects. The HR Bureau's Integrated Personnel Management System (IPMS) is utilized throughout the Department to manage all human resource requirements, worldwide.  The major components are the Global Employees Management System (GEMS), HR Online, the HR Bureau Knowledge Center, and the Post Personnel System.  The Business Objects modules provide the basis for integrating the overall IPMS program into one WEB-based platform.  Considering the sizable investment the Department made in IPMS and its migration of sub-applications toward a total WEB-based product, HR/EX feels the maintenance fee is fair in comparison to redesigning all the applications involved.  Removal of the Business Objects modules would require a costly redesign of all applications that comprise IPMS and inhibit further migration of applications and changes to the WEB environment.  It would also require an extensive implementation program throughout the Department to allow our customers access to the information.  HR/EX considers Business Objects modules as a mission critical element to supporting the Bureaus IPMS program in support of the Department worldwide.<BR><BR>

HR/EX is responsible for managing the enterprise-wide Integrated Personnel Management System (IPMS) that provides corporate information technology services.  The MKS configuration management software serves as the toolset to manage the automated processes, the configurable items (CIs) and the metrics captured necessary for audit ability, traceability and an adherence to the standards of a full software development life cycle (SDLC) and will be instrumental in current project success and ease of future project planning and implementation.   This action is taken in accordance with the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as identified by FAR 6.302-1. The MKS software provided a level of administrative ease that the other products did not offer.  MKS was less labor intensive and easier to implement due to the user friendly administrative functionality of the tool.  Other tools required additional hardware and dedicated administrative personnel.  This requirement will be published in FedBiz.Opps indicating the U. S. Department of States intent to procure on a sole source basis for the services. HR/EX conducted an initial market survey analysis of 11 CM software tools and seven vendors were asked to provide further information about their products.  After extensive evaluation and testing, the MKS Integrity Suite 2005 software was shown to meet all HR/EX requirements.  MKS is proprietary software and is only available through a MKS Software, Inc. A market survey of 11 CM software tools was conducted.  Of these, seven were found to be possible providers for a solution that provided the level of CM required to meet HR/EX business needs. Only MKS was found to meet the requirements for our specific development platforms and deliver the required CM functionality necessary to capture the required metrics.

Requirement:  (Note: The description herein is a summary of the required services and is not intended to be all-inclusive).

Overview:  There are leadership courses within Air Education Training Command (AETC) that are paper based or classroom based training that have not converted to leading edge instructional technology.  Until recent times the fidelity and ease of use of computer based courseware applications have not been able to meet the high demand for interactive scenario based learning.  
Recent advances in courseware authoring applications include the use of simulations with humans being displayed as AVATARS (computer-generated images of humans).  These advances could lead to the conversion of current legacy leadership training courses to computer based training.  

System Requirements:
1) The vendor must be able to provide a courseware development application capable of presenting human interfaces which will engage the student in making real time decisions based on realistic scenarios. 

2) The delivered courseware product must have a user interface that can be learned and manipulated by course managers and classroom instructors.

3) The delivered courseware will be capable of creating realistic AVATAR figures with speech and facial expressions that can be tailored to meet the needs of the leadership interfaces from various courses of instruction.

4) The vendor must be able to provide initial training of the delivered authoring language. 

5) The vendor must provide specific examples of how the effectiveness of the delivered courseware system can be evaluated in comparison to the current training system.

Small Business (SB) Set-Aside Determination:
The Government reserves the right to decide whether or not a SB set-aside is appropriate for this acquisition based on responses to this notice.  In order for the Government to make a SB set-aside determination, it is emphasized that SB concerns provide sufficient written information to indicate their capability to successfully perform and manage all the requirements of this magnitude.  In the solicitation, the extent to which prime contractors provide for the significant use of small and small disadvantaged business subcontractors will be a consideration in the evaluation of proposals.

Points of Contact:

Refer your questions, comments, or suggestions via the Request for Information on the FedBizOpps web site.  Additional information or updates will be posted at the www.fbo.gov.  It is the responsibility of interested parties to check this site regularly for any changes or updates.

<DESC>The Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), intends to recompete a requirement for capabilities and facilities to establish and manage a Statistical and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) to support NIAID sponsored clinical research programs in allergy/asthma, autoimmune, and transplant-related diseases.   

Under the current contract to the PPD Corporation (HHSN266200400075C), the SDCC has served to provide a broad range of clinical research support services to the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN).  Under this contract, the Statistical and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) will support each of the following two research programs: 

1.	The Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) was established in 1999 and is currently under a contract to the University of California, San Francisco.  The overall goal of the ITN is to accelerate the evaluation of promising approaches for the induction and maintenance of immune tolerance in four clinical areas: solid organ transplantation, islet cell transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and asthma and allergic diseases.  

2.	The Asthma and Allergic Diseases Cooperative Research Centers (AADCRCs) were established in 1971 to promote integrated, multidisciplinary basic and clinical research on the immunologic mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of asthma and allergic diseases.  The overall goal of this program is to improve the diagnosis and treatment of asthma and allergic diseases, and to provide a rational foundation for the development of effective therapeutic and prevention strategies.  

The Contractor shall serve as the SDCC for clinical and non-clinical research activities carried out by the ITN with the responsibility for a broad range of support functions, including: statistical design and analysis; clinical data collection, storage, management, quality control, reporting and associated training for clinical site personnel; safety oversight; preparation of study-related materials; and clinical study website development and maintenance.  

In addition, the Contractor shall also support the AADCRCs by providing assistance in the statistical design, analysis and final reporting for some of the AADCRC clinical trials and mechanistic studies upon request of the Project Officer. This will typically involve a multi-center effort and a collaborative relationship with clinical investigators, other supporting contractors, and DAIT/NIAID staff.    

(Note: Although the ITN generates both clinical and mechanistic data from each trial, the scope of SDCC statistical functions is limited only to clinical data as specified in each protocol.  Statistical design and analysis of mechanistic data and combined data from both clinical trials and mechanistic studies will be performed collaboratively by the ITN Clinical Trials Group and the ITN Bioinformatics Group).

The contract will be funded for a base period of six (6) years to provide SDCC support for the research activities of the ITN and the AADCRCs.  In addition, the Government reserves the right to exercise three (3) options: Option 1 provides for an extension of the contract for one (1) additional year to continue the SDCC support services specified in the base period for both research programs; Option 2 provides for additional SDCC support for data collection, storage, management, quality control and reporting for some AADCRC studies upon request of the Project Officer; and Option 3 provides SDCC support for other DAIT-sponsored research programs and projects involving clinical research on immune-mediated diseases, including asthma and allergic diseases, solid organ, tissue and cell transplantation, and autoimmune disorders.  These other programs and projects that may be supported under Option 3 include new individual clinical trial grants and existing and future clinical research programs/networks and projects awarded by DAIT.   It is anticipated that up to one cost reimbursement completion type contract will be awarded for a period of six years, beginning approximately July 31, 2008, with an anticipated total effort of approximately 25.5 FTEs for the Base period, zero additional FTEs for Option #1, 6 additional FTEs for Option #2, and 3 additional FTEs for Option 3.  The anticipated total effort for the Base period and if Options 1, 2, and 3 are exercised is approximately 34.5 FTEs. 

Potential sources must demonstrate and document the following in their capability statements:

The support services to be provided by the contractor under this contract include the following: 1) statistical expertise, experience, and leadership of a statistical and data coordinating center (SDCC) for clinical investigator networks and programs of comparable size and complexity to the ITN and the AADCRC including domestic and/or international clinical trials for safety and efficacy or mechanistic studies; 2) statistical expertise for feasibility assessments of study design issues for concept proposals, full applications, clinical protocols, and/or mechanistic and surrogate/biomarker studies, as well as preclinical safety study evaluations; 3) statistical assistance in the development of statistical designs and statistical analysis plans for clinical protocols; 4) statistical analyses of interim and comprehensive final clinical trial data including descriptive as well as univariate and multivariate inferential analyses; 5) electronic dataset transfer capabilities;  6) computerized systems for the collection, management, storage, security, reporting, and quality control of study data including electronic/internet-based systems to accommodate on-line subject enrollment and randomization; 7) assistance with preparation of study-related materials such as Manuals of Operations, investigator brochures, electronic or paper case report forms, and/or source documents, tracking logs, or order forms for clinical supplies; 8) development and maintenance of protocol web sites to share information and study materials with study sites and to provide DAIT and the Investigators with real-time study information, such as overall and site-specific accrual, demographics, adverse events, queries, and deviations; 9) providing training to clinical site staff to access the data system, perform remote data entry; 10) statistical and medical writing assistance for the preparation of regulatory submissions including IND applications with respect to statistical design and analysis issues/plans, including pre-IND briefing packets, annual reports, interim clinical study reports, and assistance with inquiries, meetings, and/or teleconferences with regulatory health authorities; 11) comprehensive data management and reporting services for operating and managing computer-based systems at a central facility for data collection, storage, real-time electronic notification capabilities, and management (database 1) of all clinical and laboratory research data including adverse events (AEs) for clinical and non-clinical studies conducted by the ITN; 12) comprehensive safety data collection and reporting (database 2) capabilities for reporting, tracking, and archiving of SAEs for all ITN studies conducted under the contract; 13)  serving as a repository to store (archive) all data from databases 1 and 2 for all completed studies over the contract period of performance; 14) Quality control of all data (databases 1 and 2) to monitor for accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data submitted from participating centers for 100% of the study data;  provide for security against anticipated risks, including loss of confidentiality of subject electronic records and data summaries and/or catastrophic loss of study data; 15) Safety Oversight and Reporting functions including: assist in the development of data and safety monitoring plans for each trial; assist in the preparation and submission of interim and final study data for review by NIAID-established safety oversight structures; assist in the documentation of written summaries of recommendations from NIAID-established safety oversight structures; and 16) Establish and operate a Safety reporting center for all ITN clinical trials;17) Establish, maintain, and operate one or more internet-based collaboration portals; 18) Integrated project management capabilities; and 19) Coordinate and collaborate with DAIT/NIAID-staff, investigators, and other DAIT-supported clinical research support services contractors.

The information gathered from this RFI will be used, along with other information, to determine both private sector interest and the competition parameters should AMC decide that Engine Management is a viable candidate for an A-76 public-private competition. The information requested by this synopsis will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency.  Should a future requirement evolve from this preliminary planning process, it is anticipated that the period of performance will be a base year plus four one-year option periods.  For purposes of this synopsis the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 488190 and the small business size standard is $6.5M.  AMC requests any qualified businesses that are capable and potentially interested in performing Engine Management services to reply to this RFI stating their interest and submit a capability package to include the following information:  1)  name and address of company; 2) company point of contact including telephone, fax, and email address; 3) identify business size (large, small, disadvantaged,  women-owned, 8 (a), HUBZone, etc); and 4) information demonstrating the companys ability to perform the potential requirement as described above.  In addition, we request that capability packages include your current and past performance contract references relating to Engine Management services to include: contract number; agency or organization supported; whether or not contractor was a prime or a subcontractor; period of performance; original, current, and total contract value; POC (customers technical monitor) with current telephone, fax number and email address; and a brief description of the effort.  Also, provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost for providing nonpersonal services to furnish all labor (e.g., to include direct and indirect labor such as management and supervision), supplies and materials, and overhead (e.g., to include operations and general and administrative overhead) necessary in supporting the EM services function.  The ROM should be an estimated cost per engine type to perform EM at each location for the KC-135 (F108 engine), C-5 (TF39 engine), and C-130 (T56 engine).  The estimated number of engines are 297 - TF39 engines for the C5 at Dover AFB, 486 - F108 engines for the KC-135 at Fairchild AFB, and 372 - T56 engines for the C-130 at Pope AFB.  Please limit the capability package to 20 pages.  The capability package must be clear, concise, and complete and be submitted by 10 Feb 2006, 12:00 p.m central via e-mail to Rickey.Mabry@scott.af.mil.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice.  The purpose of this announcement is to identify nontraditional defense contractors (A nontraditional Defense contractor is one that for a period of one year has not entered into or performed on any contract in excess  of $500,000 to carry out prototype projects or to perform basic, applied, or advanced research projects for a Federal agency that is subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations) that believe they have viable candidate drugs or biologics that can be exp editiously developed and will provide a safe and effective medical countermeasure against radiation injury.  The Department of Defense, through the Medical Identification and Treatment Systems (MITS) Joint Product Management Office, is gauging interest of industry, especially nontraditional defense contractors, in the Advanced Development of therapeutic medical countermeasures to treat acute radiation syndrome (ARS) using award instruments other than procurement contracts.  Drugs or biologics proposed shoul d, when administered following exposure to ionizing radiation, decrease incapacity and prolong survival by treating the gastrointestinal (GI) syndrome of ARS.  Specifically, when administered following exposure to ionizing radiation, the medical countermea sure should either prevent or reduce the extent of incipient radiation injury or promote repair of manifest radiation injury to allow preservation or restoration of the anatomic integrity and normal physiologic functioning of the GI tract.  The Award Recip ient will be responsible for conducting Technology Development and System Development activities and selecting and managing Subcontractors capable of conducting various activities associated with drug or biologic development in manners that are consistent with eventual approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Depending on the technical maturity of the proposed technology, activities may include process development and related tasks, current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)-compliant smal l scale manufacturing and testing of the product, Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)-compliant acute toxicology testing in animals, filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies conducted in accordance with FDA Good Clinical Practices (GCP) regulations and guidelines.  These therapeutic medical radiation countermeasures are being developed in response to an area of interest to treat service members for the effects of radiation injury and to allow commanders t o sustain and continue operations in the event of nuclear or radiological attacks on U.S. Forces.  Prospective products should have substantiated in vivo safety and efficacy data that clearly demonstrate the potential for further development into a FDA-app roved drug or biologic.  This is not a request for competitive proposals, however, parties interested in responding must furnish, in writing, a 1-2 page synopsis of their candidate which clearly supports its therapeutic potential and the ability of the Res pondent to perform the tasks associated with Advanced Development. The inclusion of in vivo data in the synopsis is encouraged.  MITS is contemplating the use of funding instruments such as grants, technology investment agreements, or other transactions. The response should indicate the type of award instrument of interest.  Any information received in response to this Sources Sought Notice that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly. This information may be submitted via mail, e-mail, or fax. All responses shall be submitted by no later than May 4, 2007 by 4:00 pm EDT in order to be accepted for review.  All paperwork must be sent to U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, ATTN: Shelley Marken, 64 Thomas Johnson Drive, Frederick, MD 21702,  Fax (301) 619-5069 or by e-mail to shelley.marken@det.amedd.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>A -- Novel Polybenzimidazole (PBI) Derivatives
<DESC>Polybenzimidazole (PBI) compounds have unique properties that allow them to resist deformation under high temperatures.  For this reason PBIs are used in products such as heat resistant clothing, aircraft, and braided packaging.  However, the use of PBIs is limited because the current method of synthesis only allows for fabrication of fibers, not films and other structures.  The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has discovered a method that allows for the fabrication of PBI derivatives that can be used to form films and other structures.  This allows for use of PBIs in membranes for high temperature applications and other products.  

The INL has discovered several different N-substituent carboxyl polybenzimidazole derivatives which are much more soluble in organic solvents than the parent polybenzimidazole.  A synthetic route was found that gives a modified PBI that is soluble in tetrahydrofuran (THF), methylene chloride, and chloroform.  The modified pathway provides a straightforward post-polymerization synthetic modification that can be carried out at room temperature and gives nearly quantitative yields.  Analysis has shown that the method provides high yields of PBI derivatives which retain or exceed the beneficial properties of current PBI compounds.

<SUBJECT>54 -- FIBERGLASS COVER MODIFICATION
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMAITON (RFI) ONLY.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this synopsis.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation for bid, merely a request for information only.  The Government is interested in obtaining information from industry regarding a modification to an existing fiberglass cover on an existing L3 Communications Brashear KINETO Tracking Mount (KTM) Weibel radar system.  Because of the size of the radar the original fiberglass cover will not fit over the KTM/radar.  The radar protrudes out from the fiberglass cover about a foot on each side.  The height of the KTM/radar to where it meets the base of the cover is 72.5? and the fiberglass cover is 79? tall.  There should be ample height on the fiberglass cover to accommodate the radar.  The radar with the bracket is about a foot wide where it protrudes from the cover.  Total estimated surface area on one side that needs extending is 3 square feet (6 square feet for both sides).  The fiberglass cover is about 20 years old (refurbished about one year ago) and has a double wall of fiberglass over unknown honeycomb core.  The thickness of the wall is 1 inch to give the cover straight and provide rigidity.  The fiberglass cover comes in two halves and is manually pulled up on the KTM/radar trailer to provide for a weather resistance cover (commonly referred to as clamshells).  Where the clamshells meet, the walls are shaped into a mounted fiberglass flange that houses the weather resistance gasket.  The locking position for the radar on the KTM to secure it for transportation is along the axis where the two halves of the clamshells meet.  It is most likely that both halves of the clamshells will have to be modified and the weather resistance flange/gasket will be extended around the modification.  Some hardware will have to be relocated to accommodate the extension.   Photo will be provided on request to the POC.   Responses shall be limited to 15 pages and should include, as a minimum evidence of past experience, related projects and/or existing projects, etc, and business size.  Interested parties need to identify if t hey fall into one of the following categories:  large business, small business, hubzone small business, veteran owned small business, woman owned small business, or small disadvantaged business.  All respondents that can provide any of the requested information should reply to Mike Sikorski at the following email address: Michael.sikorsiki@edwards.af.mil or by mail to 412 TW/ENRE, 306 E Popson Avenue, Edwards AFB, CA 93524.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Brand Name Justification
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure Brand Name Rittal server racks to support existing Rittal hardware infrastructure that is installed in its data center facilities.  This announcement is considered a Brand Name justification.  This is not a solicitation.  This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG). The acquisition will be conducted utilizing existing USPTO's Blanket Purchase Agreements for Information Technology products, a small business set-aside.  Rittal server rack hardware is the USPTO's established standard based commercial product in accordance with the USPTO's Technical Reference Model (TRM), which defines a comprehensive set of information technology standards, services, interfaces, supporting data formats, and protocols.  It is essential that the USPTO acquire Rittal server racks for consistency and flexibility.  Currently, the USPTO has 170 installed Rittal server racks.  The Rittal server racks are more versatile because they will handle all manufacturer servers, and are not limited to specific manufacturers.  By using the Rittal racks, the USPTO is able to support all manufacturers and move servers within the data center as necessary to support operations without having to purchase manufacturer specific racks.  Rittal manufactures manufacturer specific racks such as IBM but they are at a higher price.  These racks are for phase 2 of the Enterprise Remote Access (ERA) project.   Rittal server racks were purchased for phase 1.  Rittal server racks are needed for continuity and for efficient use of replacement parts and spare parts.  If you have questions regarding this notice, they may be addressed by email to Sylvia Van Dyke at Sylvia.VanDyke@uspto.gov.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Selectable Yield for Conventional Munitions
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Selectable Yield for Conventional Munitions

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license and commercialize its selectable yield technology for conventional munitions. 

Background: Applying appropriate force on target is important for any conventional explosives such as grenades, mortars, artillery, mines and air drop munitions. Traditionally, munitions have a fixed explosive yield. In order to avoid collateral damage an appropriate choice in munitions is paramount. 

Description:  The mechanism suggested is to deflagrate unwanted explosive yield and detonate what remains. Timing between the deflagration fuse and detonation fuse determines effective yield. The effective yield can be varied by varying the timing between the deflagrator and the detonator operation. See S&TR article for more technical information http://www.llnl.gov/str/November04/Bateson.html

Advantages:  By offering selectable yield, applying appropriate effects is simplified. The yield is varied from full detonation to full deflagration. Deflagration of excess explosive is a means to minimize damage while consuming the hazard.

Potential Applications:  
?	Modification to munitions shipping containers to reduce the threat from detonation 
?	Military 
?	Mitigating damages during a shipping accident
?	Reducing collateral damage to civilians and civilian structures

Development Status: Proof of principle has been demonstrated.

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  



Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Selectable Yield for Conventional Munitions technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Livermore, CA  94551-0808
Attention:  FBO 146-07

                                   EXPATRIATES (JUNE 2006). 

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107?296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The sea turtles are constantly splashing seawater out of the tanks and onto the decks and moisture from roof condensation pools on the decks as well.  Pooling water on smooth wood surfaces is a serious safety hazard for slipping, and constant moisture in the decking material is compromising its structural integrity, is producing noxious mold and mildew, and it must be replaced with a deck surface material that:
1. Provides adequate strength to support tank load;
2. Does not absorb moisture;
3. Provides a slip-resistant deck surface;
4. Allows visual inspection of pipes and drains below the platform; 
5. Allows ambient light to penetrate below the platform to discourage the colonization of disease  carrying insects; and 
6. Allows ventilation of the space below the platform for equalization of temperature above and below the platform

2.0	REQUIREMENTS

On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5 clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gat e guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5 in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of sub contractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane e xcept at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.

Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee req uires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do  not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 day s at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.

If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; howe ver, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.     c.  If an employee no longer ne eds an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Govern ment installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges  are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.    d.

The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the con tractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which ga te(s) may be used for access to the installation.

The Department owns perpetual software licenses for the current baseline products  however, to support more users, additional licenses and support is needed. Microstrategy software is the basis for measuring the performance of ILMS. The software and support services needed to accomplish this task in ILMS include: MicroStrategy WebReporter, MicroStrategy Office, MicroStrategy Web Professional, MicroStrategy Intelligence Server, MicroStrategy Report Services, MicroStrategy OLAP Services, MicroStrategy SDK, and MicroStrategy Bronze Technical Support A full description of the software and support services that are required can be found on the GSA Federal Supply Schedule for MicroStrategy.<BR><BR>Due to the proprietary nature of the MicroStrategy software, the required software and support is available only from MicroStrategy. The software and support described in paragraph 3 is crucial for measuring the performance of ILMS. ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system. ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000. ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System. In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc. ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the MicroStrategy software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support. Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure software and support from MicroStrategy would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the ability to measure the performance of ILMS.<BR><BR>

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)

A. Background

The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is one of the lead agencies in the Federal Government to promote and utilize methods for work that effectively cuts down on commuter traffic, use of natural resources, and related costs.  Public Law 106-346, Section 359, passed in October 2000, requires that all eligible employees of Federal agencies be given the option to participate in telework to the maximum extent possible without diminished employee performance.  This law reflects a major change in Federal telework implementation practices.  While telework is still a voluntary option for Federal employees, the new practice focuses on mandatory, as opposed to voluntary, agency compliance in offering a legitimate option for employees to telework.  

GSA partners with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to implement legislated telework mandates.  As such, GSA helps to promote the use of telework throughout the Federal Government and educate Federal agencies about Governmentwide telework polices, programs, and practices.  

GSA has sponsored an annual conference to educate Federal agency representatives and others about telework for more than a decade.  GSA has additionally sponsored and hosted a half-day Federal Interagency Telework Workshop in conjunction with these conferences during each of the last six years.  These special workshops have been open to all the Federal agency representatives who attend the general conference.  These workshops have not been open to other participants of the general conference.


B. OBJECTIVE

Objectives include:  provide education, training, technical, and policy recommendations for improving and expanding the telework programs in the Federal Government.  These objectives will be used to communicate and educate the Federal community including areas such as the Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council; Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Council; Federal Human Resource offices; Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Congress; and other telework stakeholders.

Statement of Work

A. Background Information: The National Library of Medicine (NLM) indexes more than 600,000 articles annually from more than 5,000 journals for MEDLINE, NLM?s premier bibliographic database that contains over 15 million citations to journal articles in the life sciences with a concentration on biomedicine.  MEDLINE is the major component of PubMed, NLM?s free online bibliographic information and retrieval service (available at pubmed.gov).   Subject indexing for MEDLINE consists of application of appropriate subject headings from NLM?s controlled vocabulary, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH).  Indexing policies are specified in the NLM Indexing Manual, technical memoranda, and other indexing aids. Nearly 200 individuals, including NLM staff, contractors, and staff at cooperating national and international centers participate in indexing for MEDLINE/PubMed.  Although there is a high degree of quality assurance review and computerized checking and validation built into the MEDLINE indexing production stream, it is inevitable because of the large volume of work that a few indexing errors may appear in completed MEDLINE citations.  The purpose of this project is to formulate strategies to search MEDLINE to detect potential indexing errors, perform those searches on newly-indexed citations on a regular, recurring basis, and to review the search results to identify specific indexing errors that require correction. 

B. Purpose and Objective:   To acquire services to formulate strategies to search PubMed to detect potential indexing errors in MEDLINE citations, perform those searches on newly-indexed citations on a regular, recurring basis, and to review the search results to identify specific indexing errors that require correction.

C. Contractor Requirements: Using advanced PubMed search capabilities, the Contractor will formulate PubMed search strategies to identify those citations that are likely to include an indexing error (usually an inappropriate MeSH heading or a missing MeSH heading). For a very simple example, a search would be developed to retrieve citations with the text word ?mouse? or ?mice? in the citation title or abstract, but without the MeSH heading MICE.  The Contractor will print out the results of each PubMed search performed, and hand mark the printout to indicate which MeSH term(s) should be added or deleted.  Actual maintenance of MEDLINE citations will be performed by NLM.  The Contractor will also store each PubMed search strategy to be rerun at approximately one-month intervals to detect errors in newly-added citations. There are currently about 40 existing stored searches to detect indexing errors, and the Contractor will run those at approximately one-month intervals, but it is anticipated that additional searches will be needed in the future. The Contractor will submit the marked printouts to NLM not later than the first week of each month.   If the Contractor works at a site outside of the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the marked printouts will be sent to NLM via FedEx.   The Contractor will also submit monthly reports indicating how many searches were performed and how many corrections were marked on citation printouts; such monthly reports should be submitted to NLM within the first week of each month.  A printout must be produced for the entire retrieval for each search.  Each citation must be reviewed, and when appropriate, manually annotated to indicate a MeSH heading or headings should be deleted, and/or manually annotated to indicate a specific MeSH heading or headings should be added.
