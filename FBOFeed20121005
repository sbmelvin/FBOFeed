<p>TITLE: Multi-INT Enhanced Exploitation and Analysis Tools (E2AT)<br /><br />ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-12-13</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Information Directorate, Activity Based Analysis Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers through this Multi-INT Enhanced Exploitation and Analysis Tools (E2AT) announcement. E2AT is focused on the improvement of operator-exploited sensor analytical performance for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems like the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) that operate within a Multiple-Intelligence (Multi-INT) environment. The advances made under E2AT will assist in operating under Anti-Access / Area Denial (A2/AD) conditions where limitations can degrade C4ISR capabilities. Multi-INT solutions are to be accomplished through the development of innovative technologies that will assist warfighting teams in target tracking and identification, dynamic information annotation, and achieving a high-level information fusion all-source situation awareness. E2AT development is comprised of two complimentary technical areas (TAs): (TA1) Full-Motion Video Exploitation (FMVE) which is an exploitation enhancement that has a focus on video and text source integration and (TA2) Multi-INT Data Association (MIDA) that has its emphasis on overcoming anticipated Anti-Access / Area Denial (A2/AD) conditions.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Full Motion Video Exploitation (FMVE)</p>
<p>The FMV processes that are currently in use require labor-intensive analysis in the control, annotation, and reporting of meaningful content. Current analysis techniques are limited in that they demand the full attention of at least two intelligence analysts tasked to watching video, calling out observations, and transcribing content. The E2AT challenge will be to move beyond this inefficient transcription model toward an effective automated capability. Accessing and incorporating relevant data from other domains can provide application services such as entity and adversary network detection, activity discovery, contextual geo-location, and target identification in order to provide additional support for FMV and other processes that will support comprehensive mission awareness. The exploitation of Image Intelligence (IMINT) sources involves selectively processing track-level data (e.g., from the exploitation ground stations), image and plot-level data (e.g., a report of a high-value individual sighting at a checkpoint), and handling and linking of IMINT data to non-real-time data (e.g., a Human Intelligence (HUMINT) report.</p>
<p>Multi-INT Data Association</p>
<p>While Non-IMINT sources can significantly enhance FMV capabilities, associations among these sources can also be applied to Anti-Access / Area Denial (A2/AD) situations. The various intelligence sources can be used to extract high-level knowledge (e.g., situation awareness) from low-level processes as inputs for human judgment and assist in the formulation of decisions and actions. The joint multi-INT analysis will provide insight for preparation and assistance during operations about the patterns of life of the neighborhoods and people. Within these localized events, algorithms that discover relationships and anomalies indicative of suspicious behavior can be matched against previously collected IMINT data. While the localized events may each occur over a small spatio-temporal window, the overall threat activity sequence may span a much larger geospatial-temporal window that requires support of multi-INT sources.</p>
<p>Advanced knowledge creation capabilities from multi-INT data associations can be used to provide situational awareness for real-time requirements whether involved in sensor rich environments or when sources like FMV are limited or denied (e.g., A2/AD). Multi-INT tools can aid the analyst in discovering and separating pertinent, relevant and novel data from the noisy or worthless content.</p>
<p>PCPAD-X</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) PCPAD-X (Planning &amp; Direction, Collection, Processing &amp; Exploitation, Analysis &amp; Production, and Dissemination eXperimentation) initiative is developing an operationally-representative multi-INT environment. PCPAD-X is an innovative approach to research, develop, demonstrate, and conduct objective evaluations that will facilitate the successful technology transition of mission driven solutions. This PCPAD-X initiative brings together the expertise of information technology research with advances from the Information (RI), Sensors (RY), and Human Effectiveness (RH) directorates to demonstrate autonomy and data-to-decisions. The AFRL Intelligence Software Integration Lab (ISIL) is the AFRL/RI gateway into the PCPAD-X environment and has been specifically constructed as a testbed for relevant data processing, providing access to intelligence analysis tools and algorithm testing. The E2AT program will be used as a valuable resource in the validation and verification of emerging FMV and Multi-INT capabilities within the PCPAD-X initiative. It is expected that all deliverables and product developments will be validated and verified in the AFRL PCPAD-X environment.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>E2AT is composed of two technical areas (TAs): TA1 - Full Motion Video Exploitation (FMVE) and TA2 - Multi-INT data association (MIDA) for A2/AD. The E2AT goal is to demonstrate end-to-end combined multi-INT physics-based and human-based annotated products to enable enhanced analyst performance. TA1 focuses on a permissive environment that seeks solutions to physics-based (e.g., exploited video) to human-based (e.g. chat, call-out transcription) annotations for operators. Extending multi-INT association, T2A focuses on human-based (e.g., document content extraction) to physics-based (e.g., standoff radar tracks) associations for analysts supporting an A2/AD environment.</p>
<p><strong>TA 1 - Full-Motion Video Exploitation (FMVE)<br /></strong>The primary focus of FMVE is to provide video-to-text association to enable enhanced annotated video products. Using current imagery exploitation tools such as FMV and Wide Area Motion Imagery, the outputs (e.g., target features and track results) need to be presented in a format for textual association to enable hard (e.g., video) and soft (e.g., text) information fusion. As the operator calls out information in the video, the content must be transcribed in order to enable text extraction. Solutions proposed for the hard (video exploitation) and soft (text extraction) fusion require methods in metadata (e.g., time stamps) development for association, features (e.g., words and pixels) analysis for correlation, and contemporary processing techniques (e.g., track reports) for estimation. The secondary focus is to improve the persistent need to process and generate searchable content through the annotation, tagging, marking, and augmenting Image Intelligence (IMINT) data to better describe video products. Finally, the third focus is on automated interactive approaches between the operator, FMV data streams, and multi-media content to support FMV exploitation, access, annotation, indexing, storage, and linking of IMINT products (e.g. Geographical, moving, signals) to non-IMINT data products (e.g., open source, human, and communications) to enable reasoning (e.g., patterns of life). The three elements of FMVE include developments in (1) video-exploitation associated to text-extraction for annotated video outputs, (2) content-based image and textual retrieval, processing, and dissemination, and (3) interactive visual analytics for advanced operator reasoning.</p>
<p>The result of TA1 calls for enhanced solutions to support operator video exploitation. For example, while the human viewer monitors the video feeds to recognize any significant content, their observations must be automatically translated into searchable display content as either textual and/or graphical products. The general FMVE developments would be physics-based (e.g., video) analysis to enable text-based (e.g., transcribed call-outs) hard-soft fusion. The FMVE operational advancements should leverage established technical tools and capabilities, build innovative image-to-analyst annotation functionality, and have a measureable evaluation of performance improvements.</p>
<p><strong>TA 2 - Multi-INT Data Association (MIDA)<br /></strong>The primary focus for the E2AT multi-INT data association is layered opportunistic fusion for strategic mission awareness from human-based (i.e., document) and physics-based (i.e., geographical products, GEO INT) sources to enable operational coordination of both IMINT and non-IMINT based sources. The second focus is to expand the relevant intelligence data set processing that can be incorporated into a DCGS display to exploit stand-off (e.g., radar) and extracted document products. Multi-INT data that exists as text (e.g., intelligence reports, chat), movement (e.g. radar moving target indication), signal or audio-based (e.g. communications transmissions) content should be made readily available to the analyst as supportive information that could be presented on a geospatial-based graphical display. Joint data management solutions are needed to effectively associate Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), Image Intelligence (IMINT), Moving Intelligence (MOVINT), Communications Intelligence (COMINT), Human Intelligence (HUMINT), Signals (SIGINT) Intelligence data and Cyber ISR data. Information sources, whether they are textual, video or audio, are not easily or readily transformed within the context of other data feeds (e.g., SIGINT) for Multi-INT data association. The inability to create associations from the multiple sources can cause critical information or knowledge to be overlooked or ignored. The third focus is to leverage new techniques (e.g., text-extraction, statistical relational learning, discovery algorithms, and contextual and syntactical reasoning) over various INTs to provide real-time situational awareness to the warfighter coupled with a forensic reach-back capability for identifying unknown or latent relationships (e.g. activities, patterns of life) over various operational conditions. The three elements of MIDA include developments for denied environments over (1) feature extraction with respect to both IMINT and non- IMINT analysis, (2) information management analysis over multi-INT sources, and (3) interactive textual/graphical analytics.</p>
<p>The result of TA2 requires advanced multi-INT solutions to support analysts who traditionally are focused on text extracted and exploited video products. For example, an analyst must search a plethora of data to identify significant contextual entities; (e.g., hostile forces, critical events, and salient relationships) over multimedia content that are all competing for the analyst's attention amidst an onslaught of irrelevant data. A result of multi-INT availability is that there is just too much information being generated from differing intelligence streams for analysts to holistically view and efficiently and accurately identify the relevant data. There are many unstructured data sources that are not being fully exploited (e.g., narratives) to distill "what matters", identify significant entities and their associations, and characterize anomalies, patterns of life, threats, or alerts. Filtering, correlation, association, and focus provided from other INTs can manage complexity of the various intelligence streams.. The general MIDA developments would be text-based (e.g., documents) extraction to support physics-based (e.g., radar) exploitation to enable soft-hard fusion. The MIDA operational advancements should leverage established technical tools and capabilities, build innovative text-to-analyst understanding, and have a measureable evaluation of performance improvements.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), intends to award a sole source contract to Spark Holland, 816 N. Delsea Drive, Suite 376, Glassboro, New Jersey 08028 for the acquisition of a Symbiosis Individual-Dual on-line solid phase extraction (SPE) system.
<p><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is 6 months. <br /><br />Automated solid phase extractors that are able to change the solid phase extraction cartridge for each sample are available only on off-line platforms, meaning the solid phase extraction has to be performed separately. The extracts have to be collected into individual containers and pre-concentrated which takes time and uses substantial amount of disposable supplies. The pre-concentrated extracts have to be injected into an independently operated analytical liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry detection system. There are on-line solid phase extraction systems where the extract collection and pre-concentration steps are not necessary but these system use the same extraction column for every sample, leading to cross contamination and plugs between samples, and lack of ruggedness and robustness. To avoid these problems, a new cartridge has to be used before the introduction of every new sample.</p>
<p>The automatic cartridge exchanger provided by Spark Holland is the only one that satisfies the Government's requirements because it is the only one where the on-line solid phase extraction cartridge can be exchanged to a new one before each sample. Because it is a dual system, the sample extraction and sample analysis can be performed concurrently without decreasing sample throughput over time. The dual cartridge exchanger allows the extraction and quantitative analysis of 192 samples with 192 cartridges in one unattended automated run. The SparkLink software that operates the cartridge exchanger along with two syring pumps which is able to use over 20 different reagents and solvents through solvent selection manifolds (SSM). The SparkLink software can be run on the same computer as the chromatography and mass spectrometry software, allowing easy operation and programming of the extractor, the chromatograph and mass spectrometry detector form the same computer.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Spark Holland. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">via email ONLY</span></strong> at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 49965 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN August 28, 2012. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p>B-glucuronidase is used in conjunction with our ph 6.4 phosphate buffer to break the glucuronide bonds present, since a significant amount of NNAL exists in the form NNAL-Gluc. B-glucuronidase is an&nbsp;essential component for hydrolysis in Total NNAL analysis. Therefore, no other products can replace B-glucuronidase in this validated method. MIP columns are customized to be used to extract tobacco-specific nitrosamines(TSNAs) based on the polymers made to have TSNA 3-D configurations. Therefore, no other products can replace MIP columns in the assay.&nbsp;&nbsp;MIP columns are required in the method for the assay. This enzyme as well as MIP columns can only be purchased from Sigma Aldrich.<br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), intends to award a sole source contract to the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, 2901 Baxter Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2150 for the acquisition of the Analysis of the Association Between Cell Phone Use and Motor Vehicle Crashes.
<p><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 611310, Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools. The period of performance for this procurement is 19 months.<br /><br />University of Michigan has three critical characteristics that together make them unique in the field. First, they have access to 10 complete state crash databases. This compilation representing 20% of all states is critical to the success of the project because it provides a large enough database with the necessary diversity (different cell phone bans, different crash severities) to analyze cell phone bans and their effect on crashes among different age groups. Second, the vendor is an expert in young driver behavior. The University has expertise in young driver safety that is a requirement for this project. The mission of the Young Driver Behavior and Injury Prevention Group is to advance the understanding and safety of young drivers, and reduce their injuries and fatalities on the road using a public health approach. They accomplish this by providing a deep understanding of the social, psychological, behavioral, physiological, and environmental aspects of unsafe driver behavior via many years of published scientific research. A particular expertise is the area of the inexperienced, impaired, and distracted driving behavior of teens and young adults. This expertise in young driver distraction is required for the success of this project. Lastly, the vendor bridges the fields of public health and traffic safety. This is crucial to the success of this project. The data come from the traffic safety field, but the expertise in behavior comes from public health. The University has extensive experience in both fields. These three critical characteristics combined make the vendor exclusively situated to conduct this project.</p>
<p>State crash data is collected, managed and compiled at the state departments of transportation; therefore, there are 50 separate databases. This situation leaves researchers with the choice of using only one state's database (which brings small sample size problems to the research), or separately contacting each state of interest, gaining access to the data, resolving issues of database incompatibility, and finally combining data into one useable database. The proposed vendor has current access to 10 complete state data bases that have been readied for analysis; this represents 20% of all states and is not available through other means.</p>
<p>University of Michigan is unique in the combination of critical factors that are necessary for the project to be a success. This project requires access to and experience with state crash data. The strength of the police-collected state databases is that they document all reportable crashes during a calendar year. The University of Michigan's transportation data center has been in operation for 40 years. They are known worldwide for their expertise in compiling, managing and analyzing state traffic crash data. Analysis performed on these databases offers a key decision-making tool for law enforcement officials and policymakers regarding cell phone bans and driving. This decades long experience in crash analysis coupled with expertise in public health and young driver behavior make this vendor uniquely qualified to carry out this project.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2012-Q-15095 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN September 2, 2012.</p>

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to award a non-competitive contract to Safe Kids Worldwide, located at 1301 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20004.
<p>The United States Fire Administration (USFA), in coordination with fire service organizations, has maintained a continuous program of support to develop and distribute fire safety educational resources for caregivers and teachers of the at-risk population of children.</p>
<p>The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>For over 20 years, Safe Kids has developed fire prevention strategies that work in the real world-conducting public outreach and awareness campaigns, stimulating hands-on grassroots activity, and working to make injury prevention a public policy priority.</p>
<p>Safe Kids is in a unique position to support this effort because they have a network of over 600 coalitions and chapters in 49 states and the District of Columbia that bring together health and safety experts, educators, corporations, foundations, organizations, government and volunteers to educate and protect children and families. Safe Kids educates families, provides safety devices to families in need and advocates for better laws to help keep children safe, healthy and out of the emergency room.</p>
<p>The purpose of the contract is to procure services to develop a fire safety program model to include fire safety educational resources, including a strategic action plan, to implement a community-wide coordinated effort across fire safety partners to reach at-risk populations and provide expanded and improved technical assistance to all the coalitions as part of a new USFA initiative, Fire is Everyone's Fight. The Safe Kids' Start Safe Program, which is a free program for pre-schoolers, their parents and teachers, provides a bi-lingual educational toolkit filled with resources to help teach fire safety. Start Safe will be a core component in the development and testing of the model program.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to work with its fire safety partners in three specific states that have been identified by the USFA's National Fire Data Center as being in the top 10 states with the highest child (age 14 and under) fire deaths per million population.</p>
<p>Fire is Everyone's Fight is designed to unite the fire service and many others in a collaborative effort to reduce home fire injuries, deaths, and property loss. It invites fire departments, safety advocates, community groups, schools and others to rally behind a common and compelling theme. USFA and its partners will communicate and reinforce key lessons across many proven fire safety and prevention initiatives and programs.</p>
<p>The contractor must be able to meet the following core capabilities required for this requirement. The contractor must have:</p>
<p>&bull; Comprehensive knowledge of fire and life safety messages, programs and resources for the at-risk population of children ages 14 and under;<br />&bull; Knowledge of key educational messaging and distribution mechanisms to reach the at-risk population of children ages 14 and under; and,<br />&bull; Working knowledge of implementing protocols and systems designed to share fire and life safety educational messages and resources to the public.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Experience in developing fire prevention strategies and in conducting public outreach and awareness campaigns to reach the at-risk population of children ages 14 and under<br />&bull; Existing data on high risk of fire and burn related injuries to young children<br />&bull; Existing mechanisms/protocols to deliver messages, information, and materials to the public and the at-risk population of children ages 14 and under <br />&bull; Experience in assessing fire and burn prevention needs of high-risk populations and in developing new materials to target them<br />&bull; Existing network of fire and life safety professionals, educators, organizations, and volunteers that provide technical and subject matter expertise and facilitate information exchange</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has determined that the SAFE KIDS is uniquely qualified to perform this work due to their ability to meet all the requirements listed above, their wide, deep, and broad distribution system - a network of over 600 coalitions and chapters in 49 states and the District of Columbia; and their ability to provide outreach, awareness and educational support services, through their long-standing established coalitions and chapters who have assisted them in testing and delivering fire safety programs targeted to at-risk children under age 14 to help prevent injury or accidental death by fire.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications demonstrating their ability to provide these services via email to Kim Logue no later than 11:00 a.m. Local Time on August 25, 2012. Email address for receipt of capabilities and qualifications is kim.logue@fema.dhs.gov and charles.tama@fema.dhs.gov.</p>
<p>Capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This Notice of Intent is NOT a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotation/proposals.</p>

<p>1. Illumina iScan, Standard Type Contract, Part Number: SV102-1002, Serial Number: N0278, One (1) Each, 12-Months;<br />2. Ilumina Tecan LiHA, Standard Type Contract, Part Number: SV-121-1002, Serial Number: 10001279, One (1) Each, 12-Months; and<br />3. Illumina Autoloader 2-Standard, Standard Type Contract, Part Number: SV-202-1002,Serial Number: 11139-756, 12-Months.</p>
<p><strong>This is a Follow-On Requirement</strong>. The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). The NIH Medical Genetics Branch/Inflammatory Diseases Section, Inflammatory Disease Section requires continuous and reliable operation of this Illumina equipment in order to maintain productivity and prevent data collection delays or irreplaceable sample loss. The major focus of the laboratory is the genetic analysis of common, but genetically complex diseases. This work begins with genome-wide association studies that require the genotyping of over 1000 cases and 1000 controls for over 1 million markers distributed throughout the genome. This work require a high-throughput, large-scale DNA analysis platform. The same platform is also used for homozygosity mapping experiments. The Illumina BeadArray platform achieves unprecedented levels of cost effectiveness and throughput for generation of whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism genotype data. Illumina's BeadArray technology is designed for high throughput genotyping or gene expression that has been optimized to achieve unprecedented levels of cost effectiveness and throughput. It meets the demands of our laboratory for efficient generation of whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping data. The Tecan LiHa System is a dedicated robotic system that processes samples using BeadArray chips in a semi-automated fashion, which we are currently using to simultaneously process 96 samples, each genotyped for over 1 million single nucleotide variants. The AutoLoader and iScan systems function together to load and scan the BeadArray chips and collect image data that are processed to intensity signals in two channels, which are converted to genotypes or expression data. Although the iScan has state of the art high speed scanning technology, the scan time to collect intensity data for over 1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms for each sample exceeds 15 minutes. Continuous loading and processing 96 samples would require over 24 hours of attended work. NHGRI therefore require the AutoLoader robotic system to automatically load chips into the iScan system and permit continuous unattended operation. The iScan system also includes proprietary software used for generating genotypes of expression data from the scanned image data, thus permitting genome-wide association and expression studies.</p>
<p>Illumina is the sole manufacturer of this equipment. The parts are unique to these instruments and cannot be substituted by other vendor parts. Only the engineers from Illumina have the in-depth knowledge and training and access to the parts required to repair and maintain these complex machines. As the system ages, NHGRI anticipate increased needs for equipment service. The Section requires a service plan in place to provide the service in a timely, reliable, and cost-effective manner and a critical need for maintenance and repair service plan. Failure of equipment will cause a delay in data collection and may result in the loss of irreplaceable samples.</p>

<DESC>NSN 1R-4730-013710574-EY, TDP VER 008, QTY 30 EA, DELIVERY FOB ORIGIN. This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in
order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved
by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over
the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures
listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required
to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP
WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochureis now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx". -SEE NOTES 9, 22, 26

METHOD OF AWARD - CASCADE PROCEDURE
a.	Any award(s) resulting from this solicitation will be made using the following cascade order of precedence:

1)	 In accordance with FAR Subpart 19 and PL 109-461, award under this solicitation will be made on a competitive basis from a cascading method as defined below to firms who submits a highly rated qualification package, provided that there is adequate competition among such firms.
2)	If there is inadequate competition and/or if the firm does not meet our requirement for award to a SDVOSB concern, award will be made competitively to an eligible Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) concern.
3)	If there is inadequate competition and/or if the firm does not meet our requirement for award to a VOSB concern, award will be made competitively to an 8a, HubZone , or a Women Owned  business concern.
4)	If there is inadequate competition and/or if the firm does not meet our requirement criteria for award to an 8a, HubZone and Women Owned concern, award will be made competitively to a small business concern in accordance with FAR 19.5.

b.	Adequate competition will be deemed to exist if at least two competitive qualification packages are received from qualified, responsible business concerns at the tier under consideration.

c.	When there is inadequate competition at any tier, an otherwise competitive qualification package from a responsible business concern at that tier will be considered with the eligible firms for the next lower tier. For example, only one competitive qualification package is received from a SDVOSB business. That offer will be included with the qualification package(s) received from all VOSB businesses. If there is still inadequate competition, the qualification package from the SDVOSB business will then be included with SB qualification package(s) received.
SHORT LIST CRITERIA FOR INTERVIEWS:  Each Board Member will independently evaluate the qualification packages and submit ratings to the Board Chairperson and Contracting Officer.  Board Members will be required to support each rating with narrative to support the rationale for the rating by identifying the strengths and weaknesses that is applicable to the factor.  The Chairperson will compile the rating from all Board Members in one spreadsheet.  After individual evaluation and rating of qualification packages is completed, the VA will conduct consensus call(s) to determine the Consensus SF330 Rating.  The VA intends to conduct interviews with highly qualified firms.

Greater weight will be given to Offeror's experience as a prime contractor rather than as a consultant.  More recent and relevant experience will have a greater impact on the assessment than less recent and relevant effort. 

	Joint Venture or Mentor-Protg must submit the following additional documentation for review and approval prior to award: a) A copy of a legally binding Joint Venture or Mentor-Protg agreement, and b) Identification of the party who can legally bind the Joint Venture or Mentor-Protege.  A Memorandum of Understanding or Letter of Intent signed by the Joint Venture or Mentor-Protg partners can be provided with the qualifications package.

Offeror is expected to provide the following information for each project:
1.	Project title, location and brief description including building use (Medical Facility, etc.) and contracting method (e.g., task order, design build, design bid construct, CM at risk, etc). 
2.	Project owner, name, telephone number and email of owner's contact person.
3.	Project Prime Contractor and Major Subcontractors with name, telephone number and email of contact person(s).
4.	Project Statistics including start and completion dates (original vs. actual); cost (original vs. actual) with brief explanation of what is included in the cost; square footage; foundation type; number of levels; and any letters of recommendation, performance evaluations and/or awards received.

B.	Professional Qualifications - Submit a Project Organizational Chart that includes all team members.  The chart will identify the licensed/registered Key Personnel identified below.  Clearly describe the prime responsible firm (or firms if a joint venture or mentor-protg) and individuals as well as the roles and responsibilities of individuals proposed as consultants and subcontractors.  

Key Personnel: Identify the qualifications of key personnel in the disciplines listed below.  Offeror will note if one individual is proposed for more than one position.  For joint venture or mentor-protg submittals and prime professionals with sub-consultant team members, each joint venture partner and/or each sub-consultant will provide letters of commitment to the project team.

Rating Standards and Definitions: 
The technical evaluation factors will be evaluated on an adjectival basis.  Offerors are advised any strengths that are accepted by the government may be incorporated into the contract as the minimum performance requirement.   "Deficiency" is a material failure of a proposal to meet a Government  requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.  "Weakness" means a flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. A "significant weakness" in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.

Adjective	Definition

Outstanding
	Exceeds all or almost all of the VA's requirements.  Contains many significant strengths and no significant weaknesses.  Contains extensive detail to indicate a thorough understanding of the requirements, with a low degree of risk in meeting the VA's requirements.  
Excellent
	Exceeds some and satisfies all of the VA's requirements.  Contains many significant strengths and few significant weaknesses.  Contains adequate detail to indicate an understanding of the requirements, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the VA's requirements.  
Acceptable	Satisfies all or almost all of the VA's requirements.  Contains few significant strengths and few significant weaknesses, or contains no significant strengths or weaknesses.  Contains minimal detail to indicate an understanding of the requirements, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the VA's requirements. 
Marginal
	Satisfies some of the VA's requirements.  Contains no significant strengths and few significant weaknesses or many significant strengths and many significant weaknesses.  Contains minimal or no detail to indicate an understanding of the requirements, with an overall high degree of risk in meeting the VA's requirements.  
Unacceptable
	Fails to meet stated requirements and/or contains major errors, omissions or deficiencies which indicate a lack of understanding of the requirements or an offer which cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk.  These conditions may not be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.
Past Performance:  The VA will assign an adjectival rating based on the information provided by the references and any other source.  The Government will evaluate past performance in terms of recency, relevancy and quality.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and will receive a neutral rating.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.  The Evaluation Team may consider past performance data from a wide variety of sources both inside and outside the Federal Government.  The Government evaluation team will conduct an evaluation based on past performance of offerors as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the solicitation requirements, and the Past Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in fulfilling the solicitation's requirements.


Outstanding	The Offeror's performance met contractual requirements and exceeded many requirements to the Client's benefit.  The contractual performance was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the offeror were highly effective.  
Excellent	The Offeror's performance met contractual requirements and exceeded some requirements to the Client's benefit.  The contractual performance was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the offeror were effective.
Acceptable	The Offeror's performance met contractual requirements.  The contractual performance contained some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the offeror were satisfactory.
Marginal	Performance did not meet some contractual requirements.  Performance indicated that there are some potential risks associated with the quality of work, timeliness of service, and contract performance.  
Unacceptable	Performance did not meet contractual requirements.  The contractual performance reflected a serious problem for which the offeror has yet to identify corrective actions or the offeror's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented.
Interviews:  
The shortlist of at least three of the most highly qualified firms will be notified to make a presentation of no more than 45 minutes, which will be followed by 15 minutes of questions and answers.  The attached "A/E Interview Form" will be used, which includes the following eight factors listed below.  The VA will conduct individual and consensus interview evaluations.

3.	Relevant Project Experience of Proposed Team
4.	Project Control
5.	Sustainable Design
6.	Miscellaneous Experience and Capabilities
7.	Awards Received for Design Experience

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 135%"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 135%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; BACKGROUND: white; FONT-SIZE: 14pt">U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB), Voice of America (VOA), and Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) are seeking qualified individuals for free-lance Radio, Television, Internet, and/or Multi-Media English and/or foreign language news broadcasting assignments in Washington, DC; Miami, FL; and various overseas locations that are not serviced by full-time VOA and/or OCB staff correspondents.

These languages are as follows: Afan Oromo, Albanian, Amharic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Bangla, Bosnian, Burmese, Cantonese, Creole, Dari, French, Georgian, Greek, Hausa, Indonesian, Khmer, Kirundi, Kinyarwanda, Korean, Kurdish, Lao, Macedonian, Mandarin, Ndebele, Pashto, Persian, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian, Shona, Somali, Spanish, Swahili, Thai, Tibetan, Tigrigna, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Uzbek and Vietnamese.

Furthermore, the BBG's Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB), which broadcasts radio and television programming in Spanish to Cuba, is seeking qualified sources for similar free-lance assignments on the same "as-needed" contract basis as VOA, but with OCB's free-lance work assignment locations being Miami, FL or at overseas locations. The following general information pertains to all of the above-listed VOA and OCB free-lance assignments: 1) Assignments are performed on a contract basis. 2) Most VOA assignments require working in Washington, DC; while some assignments require working at IBB studios at overseas locations. Most OCB assignments require working in Miami, FL; while some assignments require working at overseas locations. 3) Contractor candidates may be required to undergo a background security investigation and successfully pass the security clearance process in order to receive work assignments. 4) Contractor candidates must be willing to work on an "as-required" basis, depending upon the VOA's or OCB's broadcasting needs. Some broadcasting activities require working irregular hours - such as very early in the morning or late in the evening - depending on the broadcasting schedule. 5) Videotape editor candidates should have at least two (2) years experience as a videotape editor in either a commercial or Government television production facility, utilizing modern computerized editing systems and videotape machines. 6) Free-lance assignments are contracted for strictly on an "as needed" basis. The VOA and OCB make no guarantees on the amount of work assignments that contractors can expect to receive. 7) The Government is obligated to inspect all contractors performed work to insure that it fully satisfies the Government's requirements. The Government is further obligated to reject all work that fails to meet Government-specified requirements. <br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><br /><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Contractors should note that all work shall be performed in accordance with the standards prescribed in the attached "VOA Journalistic Code". Failure to comply with these legally mandated standards may result in immediate termination of the contract for default. </span></strong><br /></strong><br />The following criteria, depending on the type of broadcasting services being contracted, are used as appropriate by VOA and OCB to evaluate prospective contractors: (1) Radio or television broadcast or Internet news experience, including translating and adapting broadcast scripts. Please specifically note that for broadcasting work, the VOA requires that prospective contractors take a voice and writing test. For translation or camera work, VOA requires that prospective contractors take a translation and/or on-camera test; (2) Extensive knowledge of the target broadcast language(s) and the ability to adapt English material into the target language; (3) Ability to produce work that demonstrates a keen knowledge of national and international issues; (4) Ability to explain complex issues in clear, logical terms that can be understood by VOA's and OCB's worldwide audiences; (5) Ability to operate highly specialized and complex broadcast television equipment, such as audio consoles, character generators, wave-form monitors and vectorscopes, and videotape machines; (6) Highly developed production skills, such as: assembling/coordinating material, monitoring program segments for proper sequencing and integration, ensuring continuity, editing broadcast scripts as necessary, etc. ; (7) Ability to research, select, and prepare material to provide background and highlight key elements of VOA or OCB web news reports, prepare and encode multimedia enhancements, and either prepare or request and coordinate the preparation and encoding of additional streamed media, and ensure compliance with copyright restrictions; (8) Documented knowledge (i.e., education/training and/or practical experience) of the principles and practices of journalistic writing, editing, and Internet publishing; (9) Computer skills required; (10) Ability to operate a wide variety of digital broadcast equipment; and (11) Ability to read and analyze incoming correspondence to determine information requested and prepare a responsive and personalized respond. <br /><br />Prospective contractors are hereby notified that the basis for award will be based on best value; with technical evaluation factors (i.e., strength of prospective contractor's resume, approach to performing work) being more important than the prospective contractor's proposed hourly price. Contractors shall submit their price proposals based on an hourly and/or an assignment basis.<br /><br />All sources interested in and believe that they have the experience and capabilities to perform one or more of the above-stated free-lance Assignment/Task Orders that are issued under a contract basis with one or more of the above-stated BBG organizations (VOA) at their respective Washington, DC; Miami, FL (for OCB); or overseas locations may submit written inquiries for additional information and/or submit their written statement(s) of interest, technical qualifications, desired rate (hourly or per assignment), and pertinent experience for proposing to contract for one or more of the above-listed free-lance assignments with the appropriate BBG organization(s) as follows: (a) For free-lance assignments with the VOA (Radio) in Washington, DC or overseas, submit written inquiries for additional information and/or contract technical proposals to the Voice of America (VOA), Attention: Wendy Jackson, VOA/C Room 1300, Cohen Federal Building, 330 Independence Avenue (SW), Washington, DC 20237, email address: wjackso@voanews.com; and (b) For free-lance VOA (Television) assignments in Washington DC or overseas, submit written inquires for additional information and/or contract technical proposals to VOA-TV, Attention: Lindsey White, VOA/O, Room 2276, Cohen Federal Building, 330 Independence Avenue (SW), Washington, DC 20237, e-mail address: lwhite@voanews.com; and (c) For free-lance radio and/or television assignments with the Office of Cuba Broadcasting's (OCB) Radio and/or TV Marti in Miami, FL or overseas, submit written inquiries for additional information and/or contract technical proposals to OCB, Attention: Ms. Mary Ann Amps, OCB/A, 4201 NW 77th Avenue, Miami, FL 33166, email address: mamps@ocb.ibb.gov.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION SEEKING POTENTIAL INTEREST AND USE OF NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER UNIQUE CAPABILITIES IN STRUCTURAL TESTING 1-PURPOSE OF THIS NOTICE AND REQUEST NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) seeks to enhance the use of the JSC's unique capabilities to support government, university, and commercial activities. We believe the unique integrated resources available at JSC, including facilities, labs and technical expertise, can be of great benefit to the nation and enhance technological research and development. The purpose of this RFI is to engage prospective partners in dialogue leading to R&D efforts that enhance utilization of NASA JSC unique capabilities by industry, universities and other government agencies. The expectation is that NASA JSC will be reimbursed for all costs incurred. Our first step is to assess interest regarding the unique JSC Structural Testing capabilities that have the greatest prospects to expand partnerships, customer base and economic opportunities consistent with the NASA mission. We seek responses from organizations interested in utilize JSCs unique combination of expertise, labs, tools, and facilities, hereafter referred to as "capabilities" in the area of Structures Testing, on a reimbursable basis. These capabilities have broad application within diverse industries including the aerospace industry.. 2-UNIQUE NASA CAPABILITIES JSC's Structures unique capabilities include a full range of end-to-end structural test labs and tools as well as technical expertise associated with analyzing resultant data and operations. The end-to-end structural testing capabilities include:    -Testing and analyzing exotic materials and composites in extreme environments   -Research into understanding material properties   -Integration of those materials into novel new structural designs such as inflatable structures   -Design of subsystems and complete systems for aircraft and space flight vehicles   -Research and development of new advanced manufacturing techniques   -Rapid prototyping and fabrication of components and systems for aircraft and spaceflight vehicles, and industrial structures   -Structural, thermal vacuum and environmental testing of those components and vehicles The core capabilities/competencies managed at the Center that are essential to Structures are:   -Metallic Spacecraft Structures (potential for non-aerospace applications)   -Composite Spacecraft Structure (potential for non-aerospace applications)   -Inflatable Spacecraft Structure (potential for non-aerospace applications)   -Spacecraft Windows (potential for non-aerospace applications)   -Pressure Integrity of Habitable Elements, enclosures, or structures   -Seismic floor, load frames, multi-axis load control system, thermal chambers) More details of each Structures Capability are described in the "Structures Facility Testing Guide" documents which are available at "http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/engineering/human_space_vehicle_systems/structures_t est_laboratory/index.html   Our intent is to engage with potential partners to make available, on a reimbursable basis, NASA JSC's structural facilities and expert NASA Science and Engineering staff to conduct work.

<SUBJECT>NEXRAD WSR-88D RADAR PEDESTAL SERVICE LIFE EXTENSION PROGRAM (SLEP)
<SOLNBR>NEXRAD-Radar-Pedestal-SLEP
<RESPDATE>110212
<CONTACT>Chad M. Hepp, Phone 303-497-3443, Fax 303-497-3163, Email Chad.M.Hepp@noaa.gov
<DESC>DESCRIPTION: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS) is conducting market research for implementation of a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for the radar pedestal in its NEXRAD Weather Surveillance Radar WSR-88D.
<p>GENERAL: WSR-88D Pedestal Description: The National Weather Service (NWS) maintains and operates 165 (qty) NEXRAD WSR-88D radars throughout the continental United States, and an additional 15 radars outside the continental United States. The radars were installed between 1992 and 1997. The WSR-88D was designed in the 1980's with a projected 20-year service life. With an average run-time of 17 years, the pedestals are expected to begin experiencing metal fatigue failures in the gears, gear boxes and other mechanical systems. Pedestal motors, slip rings and other electromechanical devices have been refurbished and put back into service, but the time is approaching when these aging parts can no longer be economically refurbished and they must be replaced with new hardware. A Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for the fleet of radars is being considered. Although the basic pedestal design will remain the same, the NWS will use the SLEP as an opportunity to introduce new technology into the design given the return on investment is obvious.</p>
<p>This SLEP will require the disassembly of the antenna and connecting waveguide and removal of the radome prior to removal of the pedestal and immediately replacing with a remanufactured, overhauled/certified pedestal, also provided by the SLEP contractor. The SLEP contractor shall provide all cranes, personnel, resources necessary to remove, replace, and transport all material required to support this task. The SLEP contractor will disassemble and evaluate the condition of each pedestal and make recommendations regarding replacement, overhaul, etc. of each pedestal element. Upon authorization from the Government, the SLEP contractor will complete the actions approved by the Government. The NWS will provide available spare WSR-88D pedestals to begin the replacement and factory refurbishment process on a round-robin basis.</p>
<p>The major pedestal components subject to evaluation, overhaul, or replacement include: <br /><br />&bull; Pedestal Cables<br />&bull; Azimuth Bull Gear<br />&bull; Elevation Bull Gear<br />&bull; Elevation Bearing<br />&bull; Gear Box<br />&bull; Servo Motor<br />&bull; Data Package<br />&bull; Slip Rings<br />&bull; Azimuth Rotary Joint<br />&bull; Elevation Rotary Joint</p>
<p>Responses to this market survey must include; (1) Company profile, (2) a description of similar work performed under other contracts, (3) a statement regarding current industrial and logistical capabilities relative to this requirement, (4) customer points of contact for similar work cited in (2) above, and cost summary for similar work cited in (2) above. Additional information on the proposed WSR-88 SLEP program can be found at:</p>
<p><a href="http://ftp.roc.noaa.gov/Pub/Pedestal_RFI/">http://ftp.roc.noaa.gov/Pub/Pedestal_RFI/</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>This RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotes. All information should be submitted to the attention of Chad Hepp, NOAA Contracting Officer, via email at Chad.M.Hepp@noaa.gov Responses should be received no later than the date indicated on this RFI.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />SOURCES SOUGHT
<p>This sources sought notice is issued for information purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI marked "Proprietary" will be handled in accordance with applicable regulations and statues. Responses will not be returned.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) does not intend to award a contract solely on the basis of this notice. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not commit the SEC to solicit or award a contract now or in the future or otherwise pay for the information solicited. Respondents shall be responsible for all costs associated with the information submitted in response to this notice. The SEC is seeking interested sources for a near-future solicitation. At this time, no solicitation exists. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to identify sources that can provide portfolio holdings information with respect to investment companies (i.e., mutual funds, ETFs, etc.) in a structured format. All large and small businesses capable of providing such data are encouraged to respond to this notice. This includes, Small Business (SB), Veteran-Owned (VOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVOB), HUBZone, Woman-Owned (WOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned (EDWOSB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), and Section 8(a) small business concerns.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE) protects investors through administering the SEC's nationwide examination and inspection program. Examiners in Washington DC and in the Commission's 11 regional offices conduct examinations of the nation's registered entities, including broker-dealers, transfer agents, investment advisers, investment companies, national securities exchanges, clearing agencies, self-regulatory organizations (SROs) such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). OCIE's mission is to protect investors, ensure market integrity and support responsible capital formation through risk-focused strategies that: (1) improve compliance; (2) prevent fraud; (3) monitor risk; and (4) inform policy. The examination program plays a critical role in encouraging compliance within the securities industry, which in turn also helps to protect investors and the securities markets generally.<br />For more information about the National Examination Program please visit, http://sec.gov/about/offices/ocie.shtml</p>
<p>The Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation (RSFI) was created in September 2009 to integrate financial economics and rigorous data analytics into the core mission of the SEC. The Division is involved across the entire range of SEC activities, including policy-making, rule-making, enforcement, and examination. As the agency's "think tank," RSFI relies on a variety of academic disciplines, quantitative and non-quantitative approaches, and knowledge of market institutions and practices to help the SEC approach complex matters in a fresh light. RSFI also assists in the SEC's efforts to identify, analyze, and respond to risks and trends, including those associated with new financial products and strategies. Through the range and nature of its activities, RSFI serves the critical function of promoting collaborative efforts throughout the agency and breaking through silos that might otherwise limit the impact of the agency's institutional expertise. For more information about RSFI please visit,<br />http://sec.gov/divisions/riskfin.shtml</p>
<p>Generally, an "investment company" is a company (corporation, business trust, partnership, or Limited Liability Company) that issues securities and is primarily engaged in the business of investing in securities.</p>
<p>An investment company invests the money it receives from investors on a collective basis, and each investor shares in the profits and losses in proportion to the investor's interest in the investment company. The performance of the investment company will be based on (but it won't be identical to) the performance of the securities and other assets that the investment company owns. <br />The federal securities laws categorize investment companies into three basic types:</p>
<p>&bull; Mutual funds (legally known as open-end companies); <br />&bull; Closed-end funds (legally known as closed-end companies); <br />&bull; UITs (legally known as unit investment trusts).</p>
<p>In addition, there are variations within each type of investment company, such as stock funds, bond funds, money market funds, index funds, interval funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>Investment company holdings data is currently reported to the SEC on a quarterly basis via Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR). Many third party data providers ingest this information and create a structured data set or separately have investment companies submit portfolio holdings information directly to them on a periodic basis. The product should include, among other attributes:<br />&bull; Holdings data in a structured format, preferably XML;<br />&bull; Ability to provide SEC with current and historical databases of holdings information ("data feed");<br />&bull; Web-based interface to access information by searching on the name of a holding, investment company or any other capture field;<br />&bull; Licensing arrangements whereby 50 - 100 users can access the information either directly from the data feed or via the web-based interface; and<br />&bull; Data quality and validation standards.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>Respondents must be able to demonstrate the breadth and quality of their information. Respondents must describe the historical span of their data, the universe of funds represented by their data, where the funds are domiciled, and provide a list of data fields included.</p>
<p>The capabilities package shall be submitted electronically to Ms. D'Jaris Gladden; gladdend@sec.gov. The email must be clearly marked "RFI for Investment Company Holding" in the subject line.</p>
<p>The entire capabilities package is limited to five (5) pages and may not exceed 10MB. All packages must be received via electronic mail only before October 22, 2012 at 3:00 PM, EST.</p>
<p>Respondents should also include in their response to this RFI the following information:</p>
<p>a. Business name and size<br />b. DUNS number and CAGE Code<br />c. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS)<br />d. Capabilities Statement; specifically identifying information requested in paragraph one of under the REQUIREMENT header<br />e. Comments on proposed technical solution to include innovation and approach; specifically addressing information identified in the SCOPE</p>
<p>All questions regarding this notice shall be submitted in writing and submitted via electronic mail only to Ms. D'Jaris Gladden; gladdend@sec.gov by October 11, 2012 by 12:00 Noon, EST.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The System for Award Management (SAM) Registration has replaced the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) databases.</p>
<p>SAM is the primary database for procurement and payment information for contractors who wish to do business with the Federal Government. Prospective contractors are required to register in SAM in order to be awarded a contract by the Federal Government. Contractors are required to complete a one-time registration to provide basic information relevant to procurement and financial transactions. Contractors must update or renew their registration at least once per year to maintain an active status. Additional information regarding SAM can be accessed via www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>The FAR mandates the use of SAM and prohibits contracting officers from awarding a contract to contractors who are not registered.</p>
<p>NOTE: Registration in SAM does not guarantee that a contract will be awarded to a prospective contractor.</p>

<DESC>RAF Lakenheath is seeking sources to provide occasional crane lifting services agreement within a four-hour response radius of RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom IP27 9PN.
<p>Contracting Office Address <br />Department of the Air Force, 48 CONS/LGCA, RAF Lakenheath, Unit 5070 Box 270, 09461-0270 <br />Description <br />RFI - crane lifting services agreement<br />I. This is a request for information (RFI) for commercial items. This announcement constitutes the only such RFI at this time; estimates are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. An RFI is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be used to execute by the Government to form a binding contract. II. This RFI is issued IAW FAR Part 10 for market research. Submit written quotes (to include a price quote for ALL CLINS). <br />III. Due to the overseas location of this RFI, no set-aside would be used. The NAICS code for this requirement is 238990. <br />IV. This RFI is for the following brand name or equal commercial service: Crane Lifting Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SPECIFICATION: <br />1a. The Crash Recovery section requires the providing of crane, along with a fully qualified crane driver dependent on what type of aircraft/equipment is required to be recovered. The size crane required will vary dependent on what load is to be recovered. At most, it must be able to lift a fully loaded F15 aircraft/equipment up to the weight of 81,000 lbs from ground level and place onto a US Government Vehicle, provided by RAF Lakenheath.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MINIMUM REQUIREMENT: Crane with a boom capable of lifting an F-15E with a 43 foot width, 64 foot length and 19 foot height at a distance from within 30 feet away from the ground and onto a lorry with a 5 foot height.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: The F-15E is capable of carrying an external payload of up to 24,500 pounds,<br />to include fuel tanks, weapons pylons, missiles, and bombs. The maximum<br />takeoff weight of the F- 15E is 81,000 pounds. The basic empty weight is<br />36,500 pounds. Therefore 81,000lbs - 24,500lbs = 56,500lbs adding the external tanks, pylons, pods and the plane comes in at 70,000. However, this is worse case scenario, the onboard fuel<br />being the unknown, the plane will weigh between 60,000-70,000 pounds. Hence<br />given the crane's boom angle to lift the plane requires a 90 ton crane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1b. The Company must be able to supply the equipment on site at RAF Lakenheath within 4hrs of the call being placed by RAF Lakenheath personnel. As calls are accomplished the delivery address will be given to the contractor at that time. The 48 Equipment Maintenance Squadron will assist the company obtaining a base access pass for the time required.<br />1c. The US Government will provide certified belly bands, slings harnesses and chains etc. that may be required for lifting during the recovery of the Aircraft/Equipment. The 48th Equipment Maintenance Squadron will provide US Government procured false runway if needed for crane operation over grass or verge. <br />1d. The Contractor will be held liable for any additional damage to the Aircraft/Equipment in the event of an accident by the crane driver with the crane during recovery. If for any reason the Slings/Chains belly bands were to snap during the crane lift the liability would then fall to RAF Lakenheath.<br />The Company must be available -on call 24/7 365 days per year. Due to the fact that the F15 Aircraft may not be the only Equipment to be recovered from RAF Lakenheath.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />V. Delivery FOB Destination to: Details released upon official solicitation <br />For Reference: <br />FAR 52.232-18 AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS (APR 1984) <br />FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations <br />VI. RFI estimates may be received no later than 12:30 pm EST, Eastern Standard or 5:00 pm GMT, Greenwich Mean Time, Tuesday 28 February 2012.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please provide:<br />-Company name and POC <br />-Address (Mailing and E-mail) <br />-Phone numbers <br />-DUNS number <br />-CAGE code <br />-Itemized quote <br />-Technical specifications <br />-Statement that ORCA has been completed if a US business(see paragraph X above).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there are any questions on the requirements feel free to contact me at U.S. Comm (011) (44) 1638 522377. Estimates shall be delivered via email to the 48 Contracting Squadron, Charles.hertenstein@lakenheath.af.mil</p>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command -Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA, in support of the Joint Program Manager for Protection (JPM P) and the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) Program, hereby issues a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) in advance of a Pre-solicitation Conference/Industry Day for the Contamination Indication/Decontamination Assurance System (CIDAS).  Details for the Pre-solicitation Conference/Industry Day, if conducted, will be forthcoming. This is a draft RFP made available for comment prior to the Pre-solicitation Conference/Industry Day.  This is not a solicitation and no proposals are requested at this time.<br><br>The goal of CIDAS is to provide the warfighter a capability that not only detects trace levels of chemical warfare agents on surfaces before and/or after a decontamination operation, but also visually indicates the exact location of that contamination and provides significant utility during Detailed Equipment Decontamination (DED) operations.  This technology will afford Warfighters the ability to accurately map the area of disseminated contamination on equipment and quickly determine if a given area is (or is not) contaminated.  This technology has unique benefits, such as isolating "hot spots" from "clean spots" on surfaces and visibly indicating whether standard decontamination procedures performed were successful (i.e., decontamination assurance).  Given the capability to visibly indicate contaminant location on a surface, Detailed Equipment Decontamination (DED) personnel will be able to focus decontamination efforts on the localized threat, therefore dramatically reducing manpower, water requirements, decontaminant requirements and exposure hazard to Warfighters performing DED while increasing decontamination efficiency.  The CIDAS must be compatible with a wide range of materiel and facilities to avoid degrading readiness and capabilities due to damage from the application of indicant.  <br><br>The draft RFP and associated attachments can be accessed from the solicitation link on this page.  This announcement is not a request for proposals and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. No solicitation exists at this time.<br><br>The announcement number W911QY-13-R-0001 will be the controlling document and the Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse companies or entities that respond in any way to this Draft RFP. <br><br>Any information concerning a Pre-solicitation conference/Industry Day, if conducted, will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website at https://www.fbo.gov under announcement number W911QY-13-R-0001.<br><br>Questions regarding this Draft RFP will only be accepted in writing via e-mail to jean.t.greenwood.civ@mail.mil with a courtesy to peter.j.wallace6.civ@mail.mil. <br>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command-Redstone, on behalf of Redstone Test Center (RTC), plan to issue a contract modification to extend the current contract W31P4Q-07-D-0022 for Test Planning, Evaluation, and Documentation Support Services for RTC for an additional 6 months on the basis of other than full and open competition. A sole source modification is consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This notice is being posted because the option, under FAR 52.217-8, was not previously evaluated as part of initial task order award. This optional provision will be at the current rates specified in the current task order, as allowed by FAR 52.217-8, and will extend performance for a period not to exceed six months, beginning on 29 October 2012. This option exercise will further allow for solicitation, evaluation, and award of a competitive follow-on procurement.

<DESC>The Rio Grande National Forest is re-issuing a Prospectus for campground concession operations that will begin January 1, 2013. The Prospectus solicits for proposals to operate and maintain campgrounds under a special use permit. The operator is responsible for all operations and specified maintenance of the permitted recreation facilities. Fees collected from users accrue to the concessionaire, with a percentage returned to the government as the permit fee. A single permit to provide high-quality public service in the operation and maintenance of Government- owned recreation facilities will be issued to replace the current special use permit which terminates on December 31, 2012. The term of the permit is five (5) years with an additional five (5) years that may be awarded non-competitively upon satisfactory completion of the original term. At the end of the second 5-year period the permit will automatically terminate and a new permit may be issued through a competitive process. Additional revenue generating opportunities through the sale of specific items may be proposed.
<p>The Prospectus includes 26 family campgrounds, including one group campground, and one group tenting area within a family campground located on the Divide and Conejos Ranger Districts in south-central Colorado. The Forest Headquarters are located in Monte Vista with District offices in Del Norte, La Jara and Saguache with an extension office in Creede. Facilities in the Saguache District are not part of this Prospectus.</p>
<p>An informational meeting and tour of sites was offered on June 11 and 12, 2012. Questions asked during and after the site visit are addressed separately and are posted on the website listed below.</p>
<p>The Final Prospectus, Sample Operating Plan, and other appendices will soon be available on the National Forest website www.fs.usda.gov/riogrande. Applicants will have until November 5,2012 at 4:30pm MST to submit a complete proposal. Detailed information on this business opportunity, Forest Service concessionaire program and policies, special use permit, application, and post selection requirements are available in the Prospectus.</p>
<p>The Prospectus may be downloaded from the website listed above or requests for alternative formats (CD-ROM or hardcopy) and any questions should be directed to Crystal Powell at the address listed on the letterhead or at 719-852-6221. Please include full contact information with your Prospectus request.</p>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to the Final Prospectus are subject to cost recovery pursuant to 36 CFR 251.58 (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(3)(iii). Applicants must submit an initial processing fee of $100.00 to cover the cost of the prospectus and review of the application. Payments due the United Stated for this proposal must be paid in the form of a bank draft, money order, or cashier's check payable to the USDA-Forest Service. Payments will be credited on the date received by the designated Forest Service collection officer or deposit location</p>

<p>Interested in Introducing Your Company to the U.S Department of Labor?</p>
<p>To increase the U.S. Department of Labor's utilization of all types of small businesses, the Department's Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) sponsors Small Business Vendor Outreach Sessions (VOS). These sessions offer small businesses the opportunity to market their capabilities directly to OSDBU and agency program officials and learn about potential Department procurement opportunities. Conversely, Department procurement officials can learn more about the diverse small business resources available to meet their procurement needs.</p>
<p>Department of Labor agencies buy a wide variety of goods and services valued at approximately $1.9 billion each year. Each DOL agency has a responsibility for procuring its own goods and services in support of the agency's mission. <br /><strong><br />General Procedures</strong></p>
<p>Vendor Outreach Sessions are held in the Department of Labor Great Hall on the second Wednesday of the designated month (unless otherwise noted) from 9:00 a.m. until 12 noon. Online registration will be available 30 days prior to each session. The address is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">U.S. Department of Labor <br />Frances Perkins Building (Great Hall)<br />200 Constitution Avenue, NW (between 2nd and 3rd Streets, NW) <br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sesssions begin at 9:00 a.m. and the end at 11:45 a.m. Follow-up meetings with agency representatives may be scheduled for a later date, if mutually agreed upon.</p>
<a href="http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/osdbu/vendor_internet_info.htm#content"></a>
<p><strong>How Do I Register?</strong></p>
<p>The next Vendor Outreach Session is scheduled for Wednesday, May 18, 2011. Vendors may sign up by <a href="http://webapps.dol.gov/osbp/sbis/log_in.asp">registering online</a> at <a href="http://www.dol.gov">www.dol.gov</a> beginning on April 18, 2011.

However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than October 12th 2012  noon local time. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Point of contact Michele Devine, Contract Specialist, e-mail: michele.g.devine.ctr@us.army.mil <br><br>The following verbiage is directly from the Justification and Approval for sole source and is posted in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6).<br><br>Cerec CAD/CAM Systems are the only system that mills porcelain, ceramic, leucite ceramic, composites, zirconia, acrylic, polyurethane, metal, zirconia abutments, full contour zirconia, metal and zirconia understructures, wax patterns, models and crown templates. They offer a full scale digital network for restorative procedures. The milling machine will significantly reduce fabrication time. The system allows the dentist to prepare a tooth for a complex restoration, mill the permanent crown, and cement it all in one appointment. The base currently has a CEREC  system so the new system will be compatible with existing components. <br>The sole source will avoid duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or the unacceptable delays due to the government. Chairside intraoral scanners create digital impressions of patients teeth and sends them directly to an in-office milling machine thereby reducing fabrication time and increasing productivity. <br>

<DESC>&nbsp; This is not a request for quote; this is a notice of the government's intent to award a firm fixed price contract on a sole source basis to The University of North Texas, pursuant to FAR PART FAR 6.302-1, only one source is capable of responding to satisfy the agency's requirements. The Washington Headquarters Service, Acquisition Directorate (WHS/AD) requires an independent, non-government test, evaluation and validation of rapid DNA processing prototypes and DNA methods and protocols.
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however interested parties may identify their capability to respond to this requirement by 15 October 2012, 3:00 PM, EST by e-mail to Ayla-Rebeka.Brooks@whs.mil. A determination by the Government not to compete the contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Justification: DoD must conduct a thorough test and evaluation of the rapid DNA processing prototype technology before deployment or widespread use. While DoD is leveraging testing resources at DoD labs and other government labs, to include the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), DoD also requires an independent, non-governmental test, evaluation and validation of the rapid DNA processing prototypes to provide transparency and credibility to the assessment. DoD requires a test and evaluation by a firm with direct access to the NDIS and with staff that has published peer-reviewed literature on DNA processing methods with current national laboratory accreditation. The University of North Texas is the only known non-governmental, nationally accredited lab with access to National DNA Index System (NDIS.) Further, Dr. Bruce Budowle, the Principal Investigator for the effort at the University of North Texas, has over 40 years of experience as a senior scientist for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Dr. Budowle has authored a number of articles and publications on emerging DNA processing methods and has provided expert testimony in various criminal cases making him a leader in the DNA community. Dr. Budowle and the University of North Texas are uniquely qualified to meet the requirements identified by DoD for providing an assessment and validation of the department's rapid DNA processing prototypes.</p>

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>The Government will not be responsible for returning equipment with a full tank of gas or paying to refuel the equipment at the end of the Period of Performance. DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>The Materials Science and Engineering field has seen in recent years a strong tendency to study materials that require properties linked to having a large fraction of surface atoms, as is the case of nanomaterials. Nanomaterials are formally defined as materials with features in the 100nm scale (1nm=10-9 m) and their properties differ from those of their bulk counterparts. At NPS, we are generating and characterizing nanomaterials such as Carbon Nanofibers (CNF), Carbon Nanotubes (CNT), Ceramics with Nanometer features (graphene, WS2 inorganic fullerenes) and metallic nanostructures, among others, as key ingredients in composites for armor applications. The characterization of those materials, ca.
 their morphological features (size, shape), is usually conducted with the aid of electron microscopes, which can provide information with resolution at those length scales. The mechanical properties of these materials have been studied by either methods traditionally used to analyze bulk materials or by Nanoindentation, when nanomaterials are part of a matrix or as a consolidated, compressed solid. Unfortunately, none of those options provide means to perform both: mechanical properties measurement and study of morphology at nanometer scale. We have been seeking an interface that will allow us to study the material under tension or compressive loads while observing it under the scanning electron microscope.
 Basically, we need a Tensile/Compressive test stage for SEM.

The stage to test the materials is to be fitted inside the Scanning Electron Microscope sample chamber, so it needs to be compact, include a servo control automatic motor, be provided with software to operate it and fulfill the rest of requirements outlined in the RFQ.

Please see the attached RFQ for requirements.

<DESC>The evaluation of a solid specimen under conditions of tensile or compressive loads can provide basic mechanical properties of the material. The former condition, the tensile test, is maybe the most common type of mechanical test in Materials Science. During this examination the ends of a sample of particular dimensions are fixed in the instrument and the sample then subjected to a uniaxial load that makes it elongate until it fails. Some of the data obtained this way are tensile strength, area reduction and elongation. The derived properties that can be obtained include Young modulus, Yield strength, Poissons ratio and and other material data such as Strain - hardening behavior. Compressive tests are conducted under similar conditions although the load is applied inward, crushing the specimen, shortening its dimension and pushing its parts together, usually a prevalent way to test brittle materials such as ceramics.
For our research, a Bench Top Single Column Material Test Instrument could be used both in tensile and compressive modes.
 On an exemplary embodiment the tensile-compressive loads will be applied while the sample electrical properties will be measured by an independent system.

<p>POSITION TITLE OF DIRECT SUPERVISOR: The Senior Technical and Policy Advisor will work under the general supervision and policy guidance of the USAID/West Bank and Gaza Water Resources and Infrastructure Office Director.</p>
<p>LEVEL OF SECURITY CLEARANCE: Secret Clearance</p>
<p>AREA OF CONSIDERATION: U.S. Citizens only</p>
<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>(A) Mission Program:</p>
<p>President Obama's goal of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains a core United States (U.S.) national security objective and the long-term focus of the USAID West Bank and Gaza (USAID/WBG) Mission. In an extraordinarily complex political, policy, legal, and security operating environment, USAID/WBG is frequently at the forefront of political discourse and foreign policy implementation in the region. Through assistance activities in five technical areas --- Water Resources and Infrastructure, Democracy and Governance, Education and Youth, Private Enterprise, and Health and Humanitarian Assistance --- USAID is working with key stakeholders within the Palestinian Authority (PA) to help build the institutions and foundational infrastructure of a viable, democratic Palestinian state living in peace and security with Israel.</p>
<p>Since 1994, USAID has provided approximately $3.4 billion of economic assistance to Palestinians, $1.2 billion of which has been used to support Palestinian water resources and infrastructure development. Infrastructure development has been prioritized by the PA as one of the four National Pillars of Palestinian development, as articulated in the Palestinian National Development Plan (PNDP) for 2011-2013.</p>
<p><br />(B) Water Resources and Infrastructure Office:</p>
<p>Created in 1994, the Water Resources and Infrastructure (WRI) Office administers all infrastructure related assistance through the Mission's Development Objective 14: Access to Better Quality Water and Other Infrastructure. Today, USAID is one of the largest donors in the infrastructure sector. More than half of USAID/WBG funding over the past several years has been devoted to supporting the development of Palestinian infrastructure.</p>
<p>The WRI Office's objective is to increase and improve Palestinian access to public infrastructure and services and to support the PA's infrastructure development and capacity strengthening priorities. Through infrastructure improvements and the creation of jobs and professional development opportunities, USAID is building local implementation capacity, helping promote economic growth and improving the quality of life of Palestinians. Projects include the construction and rehabilitation of water systems and distribution networks, roads, sanitation systems, clinics, schools, and other community facilities.</p>
<p>In the water sector, USAID's strategy has aimed directly at one of the greatest needs in this arid region: increase the quantity and reliability of water supplies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Mission has financed both large-scale well-drilling and water pipeline projects in the Bethlehem-Hebron and Jenin areas as well as smaller, village-scale projects throughout the West Bank and Gaza. The Mission is also providing improved systems, training, and hands&#8208;on technical assistance to strengthen the Palestinian Water Authority's capacity to better operate and maintain its growing water system. This effort, together with the rehabilitation of aged and leaking pipelines, is reducing water losses and improving the sustainable use of limited water resources for the growing Palestinian population. Through this assistance, USAID has improved the quantity and reliability of potable water supply to more than 1,500,000 Palestinian beneficiaries.</p>
<p>USAID has also been addressing severe development challenges in the wastewater sector. Less than half of the Palestinian population of the West Bank is connected to a wastewater/sewerage network. Only about 25 percent to 35 percent of the wastewater is collected; less than 3 percent is treated. USAID is supporting a big push in this sector, having recently completed nine wastewater network projects and installed 30 kilometers of sewage collection lines that connect communities in the West Bank and in Gaza to existing sewage collection systems. The Mission has also designed and is obtaining permits for six wastewater treatment plants in the West Bank, which will collectively treat approximately 15,500 cubic meters of wastewater per day in six community clusters (approximately 5.6 million cubic meters per year).</p>
<p>In the transport sector, USAID has been addressing development constraints caused by poor road infrastructure and restrictions that prohibit the PA from maintaining roads in approximately 60 percent of the West Bank. In the past 10 years over 400 kilometers of roads have been rehabilitated. In fiscal year 2011 alone, USAID constructed or rehabilitated 366 km of roads, nearly all in the West Bank. This is part of a larger USAID effort to restore transportation infrastructure that is vital for improved mobility and economic growth. <br />Additionally, USAID has supported the construction or rehabilitation of a variety of other infrastructure. Working with other technical offices of the Mission, in the last three years the WRI Office has constructed or rehabilitated 114 schools with 767 classrooms, 18 community health clinics, seven hospitals, 34 youth centers and 10 municipal buildings and other public facilities. The WRI Office has also equipped more than 100 schools throughout the West Bank with desks and chairs and modern science, computer, media and sports equipment. As a result, more than 3,000 students a year and 420,000 people are benefiting from increased access to improved education and health facilities.</p>

The varied duties and responsibilities also call for broad professional education, training, and knowledge, including familiarity with US foreign policy goals and objectives for the Middle East.</p>
<p>Time Required to Perform Full Range of Duties: The incumbent is expected to perform the full range of duties within the first month.</p>
<p><br />D. REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS AND EVALUATION CRITERIA <br />In order to be considered for the position, a candidate must be a U.S. citizen and must submit an application in accordance with the guidance provided. Consideration and selection will be based on a panel evaluation of the evaluation criteria. Interviews and a writing exercise may be requested, and professional references will be checked at the discretion of the USAID/WBG Mission. Applicants are required to prepare a brief narrative demonstrating how education, experience, and skills address the evaluation criteria listed below.<br />Candidates must also have effective computer skills particularly in Microsoft Office. The selected candidate must be willing to travel to Jerusalem and to the West Bank. Depending on location, travel to the West Bank may require a security escort, which will be provided by the Mission. Travel to Gaza is prohibited at this time. Periodic regional or international travel may also be required.<br />The selected candidate must be able to obtain USAID secret security clearance. This process involves a comprehensive background investigation performed by the appropriate U.S. Government Agency. A U.S. State Department medical clearance will also be required. Details on how to obtain a medical clearance will be provided once a job offer is made and accepted.</p>
<p>EVALUATION/SELECTION CRITERIA</p>
<p>EDUCATION: (10 points)</p>
<p>A Bachelor's degree in engineering, construction management or a related field is required. Additional education would be considered a benefit.</p>
<p>WORK EXPERIENCE: (50 points)</p>
<p>A minimum of fifteen years of demonstrated technical and managerial leadership in engineering, construction or infrastructure development is required. At least four years of the work history must include experience with a bilateral or multilateral donor organization. Previous experience as a senior level advisor or infrastructure-related office director or deputy is highly desirable.</p>
<p>Expertise in the design and management of technically relevant activities and demonstrated mastery of a range of infrastructure development and planning skill sets is required.</p>
<p>KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND ABILITIES: (40 points)<br /><br />Demonstrated experience in a team environment and excellent skills as a program manager are required. Strong interpersonal skills and proven ability to work effectively in a culturally diverse context are required. Superior oral and written communication skills in English are required.

Experience with and knowledge of US foreign policy goals and objectives for the Middle East region is required. Excellent time management skills and ability to cope effectively with a fast-paced, sometimes stressful work environment are essential.</p>
<p>E. COMPENSATION</p>
<p>The position has been classified at a GS-15 level. The actual salary of the successful candidate will be negotiated within the GS-15 pay band, depending on qualifications and previous salary history. It is unlikely that an individual will be selected who does not already have the prior training and experience to fully perform at the GS-15 level, or who in some other way does not fully meet all requirements for the position. However, should such an individual be offered a position, the offered salary may be at less than the minimum salary in the GS-15 pay band.</p>
<p>F. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The working environment at the USAID/WBG Mission is stressful due to the ongoing conflict. Due to the unpredictable security situation, travel of all Americans, including U.S. Personal Services Contractors (USPSCs), to West Bank, is subject to the Regional Security Officer's approval and, depending on location, may require a security escort. Travel to Gaza is not permitted.</p>
<p>G. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>The WRI Office is comprised of two USDH Engineering Officers and seven FSNs (including three Senior Engineers). The WRI Office is the largest technical office in the Mission. The USAID/WBG Mission is based in Tel Aviv, Israel. The Mission works closely with the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem and the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp; <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt">Electronic Procurement Information Control (EPIC) System</span></span></strong>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 3pt; mso-outline-level: 1"><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for market research, budgetary and planning purposes only.</p>
<p>The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) is exploring technology which will help streamline and automate the existing end-to-end print procurement workflow. The opportunity expressed in this RFI is referred to as the EPIC system. The resulting system should be scalable, provide real-time access to specified current and historical print procurement data, and be accessible to all users (e.g. GPO, commercial vendors, contractors, Federal Agencies, and public). EPIC will be aligned with GPO's Strategic Plan for FY 2012-2016 and the agency's Enterprise Architecture (EA).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It will also integrate with evolving enterprise-wide systems, including GPO's Business Information System (GBIS) and other future enterprise systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The objectives of EPIC are as follows:</p>
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0pt" type="disc">
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To implement a system that maximizes Customer Services' print procurement workflow efficiency to provide more timely service and ultimately reduce administrative costs.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To support a flexible, consolidated, extensible, scalable, modular, sustainable, accessible, comprehensive, and efficient print procurement workflow.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To allow necessary updates or to incorporate changes to workflow processes on an as-needed basis as they are developed and implemented.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">Support existing and enhanced print procurement processes and methodology as described in the CONOPS and requirements document without introducing constraints imposed by a new solution.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">Replace or improve existing print procurement IT systems with a modern, modular system that meets program sponsor/owner expectations.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To centralize print procurement information for GPO and external users.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To maximize process transparency for all stakeholders thereby reducing administrative effort and improving communications.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To provide intuitive functions and enhanced services to increase user satisfaction.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To improve business processes. </li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To capture information necessary for the print procurement process only once and as early in the workflow as possible; eliminate rekeying of data.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To maximize transfer of pertinent information between GPO business unit systems and users.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To implement a system that aligns with GPO's overall IT strategy, EA, and enterprise systems including FDsys and GBIS.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To maximize the ability to interface with external customer systems.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To support all users, including those with disabilities in accordance with Section 508.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To minimize disruption of customer and GPO processes during development and implementation.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To develop the appropriate documentation that supports system development.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To implement a system that utilizes technical and industry best practices.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To provide training for GPO, external customers, and external stakeholders using the new system. </li>
</ul>
<p>GPO is requesting industry assessment of our current documentation as well as for industry to provide information regarding the state of technology for the desired system, and to identify the capabilities of vendors to provide all or a portion of the services required for EPIC. This information will be used to help further define EPIC requirements and make informed business decisions regarding next steps.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background</strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 3pt">GPO is the Federal Government's primary centralized resource for gathering, cataloging, producing, providing, and preserving published U.S. Government information in all its forms. GPO's Customer Services organization provides comprehensive print procurement services to the entire federal government. This is accomplished by utilizing the following print procurement vehicles:</p>

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 3pt"><span style="COLOR: windowtext">Throughout its history, the Customer Services department has carried out its mission utilizing predominately manual processes with information organized in a now aging mainframe system. The material submitted to Customer Services by Federal customers represents order information that impacts stakeholders throughout the print procurement process (such as Financial Management, and GPO's Library and Sales Programs). As such, the current process introduces inefficiencies such as duplication of effort (multiple keying of same data) and creates multiple opportunities for error during translation of order information from paper submissions by customers to GPO-generated specifications, award and post-award documents, etc. In this process, pertinent information about the order must be passed to other processes within the print procurement workflow which further perpetuates errors and inefficiencies. Current systems constrain transparency within the overall workflow and tracking information is fragmented across multiple systems, which impacts the real-time sharing of information and job tracking data. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Opportunity</strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 3pt">GPO is seeking to better understand the technology roadmaps of possible solutions with which GPO could realize EPIC goals, objectives, and requirements. In addition, GPO is looking to become more familiar with the vendors who provide, sell or integrate technology solutions that can support GPO and the EPIC program.</p>

<a href="mailto:donald.w.morgan3.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Aberdeen Division D</a>
<DESC>The purpose of the SANR Industry Days is to provide a forum where the US Government (USG) can meet with interested Industry parties and discuss the Government's plans to acquire a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) SANR following the recent Request for information (RFI) posted on 19 July 2012 to FEDBIZOPS.  The intent of Industry Days is threefold:<br><br>   (1)	Provide the USG an opportunity to present an overview of the SANR program and Acquisition Strategy.<br><br>   (2)	Provide Industry an opportunity to meet with the USG in closed one-on-one sessions to present additional information above and beyond their RFI response, and to engage with the USG in a question and answer session.<br><br>   (3)	Provide Industry an opportunity to see a static display of aircraft intended to integrate the SANR capability.  The static display will be limited to viewing the avionics bays in which the ARC-201D radios are currently installed.  The purpose is to provide industry with a qualitative appreciation for the SANR integration (e.g. Size, Weight and Power (SWaP)) challenges.<br><br>Industry Days will occur over three days, 11-13 September 2012 (Tue, Wed, & Thur).  The preliminary agenda follows:<br><br>   (1)	Day 1, 11 Sep (a.m.), Heiser Hall, Bldg 3712, Patton Road, Redstone Arsenal: (2-3 hours) AMF JTRS briefings to Industry and general discussion (Q&A) with all interested vendors in an open form.<br><br>   (2)	Day 1, 11 Sep (p.m.), Aircraft Static Display at Redstone Test Center, Redstone Army Airfield  (tentative) UH-60M, CH-47F, OH-58D, and AH-64D (Block III if available): Provide industry teams (5 persons max) 10-15 minutes to view each aircraft (no photographs).<br><br>   (3)	Days 2/3, 12-13 Sep, Booz Allen Hamilton Facility, 6703 Odyssey Drive, Huntsville,  (Research Park):  One-on-One Industry sessions with USG in closed session approximately 60 minutes each.<br>	<br>Scope of Day 1 brief to industry and Day 2/3 closed sessions will be limited to discussion on the SANR.  There is no intent by the USG to engage in discussions on the Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) or Link 16 requirements.<br><br>The USG expects that the Day2/3 closed sessions will be used by Industry to provide additional information and/or clarification for the previously submitted RFI responses.  Please do not simply restate the RFI response data.  Avail yourself of this opportunity to engage in Q&A and present any new information that you deem worthy for consideration. You will be afforded the opportunity (not mandated) to present a slide briefing and the venue will be accordingly equipped with screen, projector and laptop.  Any briefings you intend to present should be available on CD/DVD.  You will only be afforded approximately 60 minutes total, so it is important to plan accordingly.  The USG audience will consist mostly of AMF JTRS program office, aircraft PMO and Requirements personnel (USG and their office support contractors). <br><br>The objective of the conference is to provide an unclassified presentation to meet with interested Industry parties and discuss the Government's plans to acquire a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) SANR. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.  Non-Government personnel may potentially be present during the USG presentation and one-on-one sessions.  The Government intends to establish a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with all non-Government personnel.  Interested parties that are willing to have non-Government personnel present may wish to enter into corporate NDAs at a date prior to Industry Day since doing so on the actual Industry Day may not be feasible.  Additionally, although proprietary data is not sought in the sessions, interested parties that intend reveal proprietary data should disclose this intention to the Government before the sessions.  <br><br>The attached Registration Form must be filled out and returned per the instructions no later than 24 August 2012.  Registration will close at 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on Friday, 24 August 2012. Pre Registration is required. Walk ins will not be permitted.

<DESC>This synopsis is an update to the 20 September 2012 synopsis issued under Classification Code 19 - Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) and referenced as solicitation N00024-13-R-2400.   The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to issue a full and open competitive solicitation in the October 2012 timeframe for the service life extension of LCAC crafts to sustain/enhance craft capability, to replace obsolete electronics, to repair corrosion damage, to reduce life cycle cost by improving reliability and maintainability, to increase survivability, and to establish a common configuration baseline.  The solicitation is for the SLEP of two craft, LCAC 88 and LCAC 89, with delivery requirements of no later than 16 months after the induction of each craft.

The Navy intends to post, on FEDBIZOPPS, a DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about 5 October 2012.
  Prospective Offerors are advised that the Government will accept comments and questions pertaining to the DRAFT RFP and the FY13 LCAC SLEP Technical Data Package (TDP).  Offerors shall submit any questions or comments regarding the DRAFT RFP or the TDP via email to Ms. Linda Squires at linda.squires@navy.mil.   No comments, questions or inquiries shall be made of any Government person other than the Point of Contact (POC) listed above. All comments and questions shall be emailed directly using the subject line "LCAC SLEP FY13 DRAFT RFP" and submitted on the form attached to the DRAFT RFP.

A site visit at ACU 4 is anticipated for 12 October 2012 to allow business sources an opportunity to survey LCAC 83 (a non-SLEP craft with similar configuration to both LCAC 88 and LCAC 89).
  Also, depending on craft availability, there may be an opportunity to survey a craft currently undergoing a maintenance availability, allowing interested parties the ability to survey the underwater hull structure.  This site visit will also include access to the LCAC SLEP worksite, the Tension Fabric Shelter (TFS), the lay down, material receipt and services areas.  Interested parties who attended the previous site visit are encouraged to attend this second site visit.  No other site visit is planned for this pre-solicitation notice or any subsequent solicitation.  Each company requesting a site visit will be allocated a two-hour window during which no more than 5 personnel, in total, may attend.
  Interested parties shall respond to Ms. Linda C. Squires at linda.squires@navy.mil no later than 1600 EST on 10 October 2012 and provide a Company Point of Contact to whom specific information regarding this site visit can be relayed.

Interested parties who have not already requested the FY13 LCAC SLEP TDP from Ms. Linda C. Squires are encouraged to do so prior to this site visit.  It is anticipated that the FY13 LCAC SLEP TDP will not be revised prior to the issuance of any RFP.

Inquiries/questions concerning this announcement may be e-mailed to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Linda Squires, at linda.squires@navy.mil.  This synopsis, any future synopses, the RFP and any amendments will be posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce On-Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.
  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. 

No comments, questions or inquiries shall be made of any Government person other than the Contracting Officer identified in this synopsis.  

CAUTION:  The final solicitation, if any, will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto.  Because of this, the Government is under no obligation to maintain a bidders mailing list.  

This pre-solicitation notice is for information only, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award contracts.
  The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept, proposals as a result of this synopsis.  If a solicitation is issued in the future, it will be announced via FEDBIZOPPS/NECO and interested parties must comply with that announcement.  

This is not a request for proposals, a promise to issue a request for proposals, or a promise by the Government to pay for information received in response to this synopsis or any subsequent synopsis.   There is no funding associated with this announcement.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice.  The issuance of a DRAFT RFP does not restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition strategy.
  This information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>Amendment #000001 was issued today, formally incorporating all nine questions and answers received in response to the solicitation.  The amendment revises 1552.209-74 "Limitation of future contracting" section (c), revises Section 5.a "Summary of Past Performance" of the Technical Proposal Instructions and removes in its entirety Section L.4 "Disclosure Requirements for Organizational Conflict of Interest."  The amendment may be found at:
http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/1200014/index.htm
The "Questions & Answers" are as follows:
Q.1 Are commercially available models precluded from consideration in an offeror's approach for Task b?
A.1Commercially available models are not precluded from consideration of an offeror's approach for Task No. B.
Q.2 If commercially available models are acceptable; should the ODC allowance shown on p. 134 be disaggregated to provide specific license fees?   
A.2 The ODC estimates should not be disaggregated, as those estimates are utilized for purposes of cost and price evaluation.  However, license fees would likely need to be included if they met the criteria included in Section G of the cost proposal instructions, located on p. 133 of the Request for Proposals, which instructs offerors on the information required for ODCs.
Q.3 We respectfully request that EPA please consider modified language regarding paragraph (c) of the Limitation of Future Contracting clause such that the limitations apply on a work assignment basis, and specifically to the scope of the proposed work assignment. We are concerned that the current proposed Limitation of Future Contracting clause (LOFC) on p. 35 of the solicitation may be overly restrictive as written.  A strict interpretation of the proposed language could imply that no firms that perform work for commercial entities in the U.S. would be eligible to compete for this work.
A.3 H.6 1552.209-74 "Limitation of future contracting" section (c) has been changed to: (c) Unless prior written approval is obtained from the cognizant Contracting Officer, the Contractor during the life of such work assignments agrees it shall not enter into a contract with a power generation firm or their operating affiliates, or firms that are point source emitters of Hg, SO2, NOx, or CO2, that would present an organizational conflict of interest with respect to the subject matter of a work assignment.

Section 5.b "Summary of Past Performance," on p. 130 of the technical proposal instructions, is for a separate summary narrative statement with the content requested by that section.  The solicitation is corrected to indicate that the Past Performance Questionnaire is Attachment No. 4.

The period of performance for this contract will likely include a twelve-month base period, with four option years.

<DESC>Amendment to the Pre-solicitation Notice for the SOFAST-E Effort<br><br>NOTICE OF CHANGE TO THE SOFAST-E NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br><br>In accordance with recent changes implemented to the NAICS, code 333319 no longer exists. Accordingly the Government will be utilizing the NAICS 333318. This adjusted NAICS has the same connotation (Other Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing) as 333319, however, the size standard for business participation will increase from 500 to 1000 employees. <br><br>This may affect some businesses who, under the auspices of 333319, were ineligible for bidding as the Prime but may now qualify under this new increased size standard. This change should not impact those companies currently planning to bid as the Prime contractor. <br><br>The Government will be releasing a revised draft Request for Proposal (RFP) the week of October 8-12, 2012, with a target release of the final RFP sometime in late October.  <br><br>**End of Amendment Dated 5 October 2012**<br><br>Due to internal tracking procedures at PEO STRI, the SOFAST-E solicitation number, W900KK-12-R-0021, has been revised to the subject number W900KK-13-R-0002. The Government will be posting the most current, revised copy of the draft RFP and Attachments under this new solicitation number. <br><br>Special Note Regarding Tentative Date Changes in the SOFAST-E calendar:<br><br>* Deadline for Distribution Agreement/Request for Document Library access: 12 October 2012, no later than (NLT) 2:00 PM, EST<br>* Estimated Date for Final RFP Release: 19 October 2012<br>* Cut-off for questions after RFP release: 2 November 2012, NLT 12:00 PM, EST<br>* Proposals Due: 14 December 2012, NLT 2:00 PM, EST<br> <br>Special Note Regarding Access to the Document Library:<br><br>The GFI list provided in the draft RFP (Attachment 9) comprises ALL the material currently available to the AWARDEE upon contract inception. The vast amount of data and the mixed media upon which it is archived makes it impossible to include it all in the Library. The Government will be including the data it is able to provide and that it feels are necessary to propose against the RFP.<br><br>If there are any questions/concerns regarding this announcement please email the PEO STRI point of contact, Mr. Matt Sanders, matthew.sanders6@us.army.mil

For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein.

Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.    (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches. <BR> <BR>The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>
