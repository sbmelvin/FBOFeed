<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to develop a finite element analysis that replaces the conventional load-deflection equations with a search for minimum of elastic strain energy on the element-by-element basis.

This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the finite element analysis from Vanderplaats Research and Development, Inc. (VRD)Colorado Springs, Colorado. VRD is the only responsible source and no other source is capable of satisfying the Agency's requirement.  VRD owns the proprietary rights to the optimization algorithm which will be used to develop the required analysis. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>GSA is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective November 8, 2002, electronically only.  The Schedule is entitled "FSC 71, Part II - Household and Quarters Furniture". The solicitation number is 3FNH-F6-020002-B, Refreshed #1.  Special Item Numbers (SIN) 71-202 Wall Units (wood w/ laminate) and 71-203 Loft Groups, are 100% small business set-aside.

Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.fedbizops.gov.  This site provides instructions for downloading the solicitation files.  Search using Solicitation Number 3FNH-F6-020002-B, Refreshed #1 (include the dashes). 

The basic solicitation includes clauses, which must be completed and returned by all offerors.  Some of the changes made to the solicitation are: I-FSS-163 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen):  This clause will allow the government to have three (3) five (5) year options to your contract, for a total of twenty years if performance is satisfactory.  The options are not guaranteed.  Some of the measurements of satisfactory performance will be such things as adequate sales, quality performance, and timely IFF payments.  One of the most important evaluative factors will be participation in the GSA Advantage! program.  None of the Evergreen options will be exercised unless your firm has posted its contract information to the GSA Advantage! website.  All offers received will have 6 months after award of a Federal Supply Schedule contract to submit their electronic catalog to GSA Advantage!.  Contractors may now be represented as 8(a) contractors, providing SBA confirms that the offeror is indeed an eligible 8(a) contractor.  These changes are intended to increase the teamwork that has led to greater customer satisfaction and use of the Federal Supply Schedules.  There are mutual benefits for both the contractor and the government, and it is expected to increase revenues to those contractors who earn the right to maintain a contract for the entire twenty-year period.  Contracting questions should be directed to the points of contact listed in the solicitation. 

The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous.  Individual contract periods will begin on the date of award and will expire five years later (exclusive of any options or cancellations).  All contracts will be indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contracts with $2500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period.  All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions.  We actively solicit offers from 8(a) firms for the products/services found under this MAS solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered.

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for maintenance, porting, distribution, and consultation of NASA/JSC's Hewlett-Packard version of the Thermal Synthesizer System software per Attachment A, Statement of Work. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from SpaceDesign Corporation.  SpaceDesign Corporation is uniquely qualified to perform the work under this procurement due to their extensive experience with the TSS and their possession of the license to distribute a commercial version of TSS.  Maintenance of the complex program requires an in-depth knowledge of its architecture, use, and algorithms.  The SpaceDesign staff has had extensive experience in developing and maintaining TSS applications and possess the knowledge to understand the engineering algorithms used in the thermal radiation, orbital mechanics, on-orbit heating, and conductance-capacitance applications.  Additionally, their past 3 years of experience in maintaining the code along with the knowledge gained through development of their commercial TSS version has resulted in an organization that is uniquely qualified to perform this work.  While other entities could undoubtedly port and distribute the software, understanding the accuracy of the output and providing expert consultation would require a significant initial investment in training and would not be cost efficient for the Government to pursue. This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 541519 and $21.0 million, respectively. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on  December 9, 2002.

<DESC>This solicitation is intended to support near-term fundamental gasification technologies research projects that are: 1) Fundamental in nature, and = 2) Important for the commercial success of gasification technologies.  It = is anticipated that the resultant projects will provide fundamental data useful to many organizations across the industry to help move gasification technologies toward the commercial marketplace.  A secondary objective is to increas= e university involvement with the Gasification Technologies Program to en= sure the inclusion of fresh, innovative ideas in the program, and to educate fut= ure scientists and engineers in gasification technologies.  Last year, the Gasification Technologies Product Team held interviews with industry organizations to gain industry?s perspective on barriers to the commerc= ial success of gasification technologies.  This resulted in a list of speci= fic research and development areas for product team consideration.  This solicitation will address some of the near-term fundamental research ne= eds described on this industry-generated list, chosen and modified by the Gasification Technologies Product Team based on additional input from industry and the needs of the DOE Gasification Technologies Program. The program solicitation will focus on the following three topic areas:= 1. Economic Use of Low Ranked Coals -  Develop technologies to remove t= he barriers preventing the economic use of low ranked (sub-bituminous and lignite) coals.  Examples: (a) New/improved approaches for increasing the therma= l stability of dewatered lignite.  (b) Process/technology to create a hig= her energy density feed slurry, including understanding the critical proper= ties changed by the process in terms of feed systems. 2. Improved Materials to Increase Equipment Life or Reliability - Devel= op improved materials to increase equipment life or reliability in the gasifier and through the process to the syngas cooler inlet.  The net result of = the material improvement must have potential to be an economic advantage to=  the gasification industry.  Examples: (a) Improve feed system injector materials to increase the injector life.  (b) Increase the life of gasifier refracto= ry, by creating a more robust refractory, through investigation of refractory reactivity with gasifier contaminants and techniques to improve refract= ory stability, etc.  (c) Metal alloys/fabrication that can survive in the gasifier environment long enough to: 1) Assist the development of more robust instrumentation (current average lifetime of thermocouples is 30-45 day= s), or 2) Permit metal candle filter use at temperatures approaching those in = the gasifier (current metal filters have an operation limit of about one ye= ar at 450=B0C). 3. Cleanup of Fuel Gas Contaminants and Flue Gas Pollutants - Develop innovative, less expensive approaches to resolve environmental and/or economic concerns with coal gasification fuel gas contaminants and combustion fl= ue gas pollutants, including the need for ultra clean feed gas for chemical production.  Examples: (a) Conduct a mercury balance on the gasificatio= n process.  (b) Create an added value technology or study for solid or chemical by products such as the concentration of mercury from conventional remo= val system for sale, creation of a process using high purity sulfur to make=  a more lucrative product, etc.  (c) More effective/less expensive reduction of= pollutants and/or trace contaminants in the combustion flue gas.  (d) N= ew instrumentation/techniques to measure trace metal concentrations in a high-temperature, high-pressure, reducing environment. Given the objective of this program to increase university involvement = in the Gasification Technologies Program, a determination was made to limit recipients under this program solicitation to U.S. colleges and universities and university-affiliated research institutions.  Industry collaboration wi= ll be encouraged under this program, but only through cost-share and subcontracting arrangements.  Subcontracting opportunities by private entities/corporations is limited to no more than 10% of DOE funding provided under the cooperati= ve agreement.  In addition,  Federal agencies and agents (i.e. Management = and Operating (M&O) contractors and/or National Laboratories) are prohibite= d from proposing as a prime contractor or subcontractor under this solicitatio= n. Cost sharing is encouraged, but not required, under the subject program solicitation.

<SOLNBR>ESCAWK-03-R-0001
<RESPDATE>121102
<ARCHDATE>06112003
<CONTACT>Lt. Salvatore Saraceno, Contracts Manager, 781-377-6859
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND INTEREST FROM COMMERCIAL VENDORS OF ACTIVE NOISE REDUCTION (ANR) HEADSETS.  The Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) System Program Office (SPO) is partnering with the 552nd Air Control Wing (ACW) and Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) to conduct a demonstration and validation (Dem Val) of ANR and spatial communications technologies.  The objectives of this project include the evaluation of requirements and potential solutions for improving noise protection measures associated with the air and ground operations of the E-3B/C (Boeing 707) AWACS aircraft.  An important element is the actual trial operational use of candidate ANR headsets during AWACS missions of extended duration, i.e., longer than eight hours.  This announcement requests responses from interested vendors who are willing to loan, at no cost to the Government, four identical candidate (i.e., meeting all of the minimum technical criteria below) headsets, for the purpose of comparative operator evaluations in controlled airborne and ground test environments.  Evaluations are scheduled to be conducted by AFRL human engineering experts during the week of 13 January, 2003 at Tinker AFB, OK.  At the end of the evaluation period all headsets will be returned to their owners in their original condition within 30 calendar days of completion of the last trial.  The Government will enter into a Bailment Agreement with each contractor providing headsets for evaluation.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  IT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, SOLICITATION, OR AN INDICATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL NECESSARILY CONTRACT FOR ARTICLES AS A RESULT OF THE EVALUATION.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR INFORMATION RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI.  The overall objective of the planned operator trials is to help the 552nd ACW determine the best available and most affordable solutions for improving hearing protection of AWACS aircrews and ground crews, who are routinely exposed to high levels of noise.  During these operational evaluations extra attention will be paid to human factors considerations, such as comfort, fit, and ease of use, especially during missions of long duration (over eight hours).  The operational noise environments for both air and ground crews have been thoroughly sampled and analyzed by audio specialists from AFRL, and noise protection improvements have been determined to be possible through a combination of active and passive means.  This validates work performed at the request of the Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) in a 2001 comprehensive market survey and assessment of active noise reduction headsets commercially available off the shelf.  The survey, conducted by AMB's contractor, Concurrent Technologies Corporation, resulted in a November 2001 report verifying the value of ANR to protect against noise in the low-frequency range of 20 to 500 dB.  AMB's effort culminated in a briefing to and endorsement by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) and their recommendation that all commands consider acquiring ANR headset capability.  This RFI leverages off the work done in the AMB effort and delineates the following technical requirements that each candidate headset must meet in order to qualify as a candidate for AWACS evaluation: 1)	Plug-and-play capable, that is, compatible with or adaptable to E-3 aircraft interphone system (U-174 plug), including low-impedance microphone; 2)	Meet or exceed E-3 electromagnetic/radio frequency interference requirements; 3)	Capable of achieving a minimum of 15dB active noise attenuation (below 500 Hz) for air operations and 25dB total (active and passive) attenuation for ground operations; 4)	Weigh no more than 16oz with battery(ies) for airborne evaluations and 24oz with battery(ies) for flight line evaluations; 5)	Powered by 9v or AA battery(ies) with potential growth for conversion to internal aircraft power; and 6)	(desired) Two-channel capable and usable in 3-D audio testing (smooth frequency response between 60 Hz and 15,000 Hz desired; matched polarity in L-R speakers desired; and volume balanced within 1 dB desired across the headset); Interested parties who have products that meet the above criteria should provide up-to-date product description, technical information, and primary contact information not later than 11 Dec 2002.  All RFI submissions shall be faxed or electronically sent to: Lt Sal Saraceno, Contracts Manager, Salvatore.Saraceno@hanscom.af.mil, FAX# (781) 377-5705, or Capt Demetrius Green, Contracting Officer, Demetrius.Green@hanscom.af.mil.  This RFI is available on the Federal Business Opportunity Page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov or the HERBB Page at http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil.  All respondents are requested to indicate if they are a US company, large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, or women-owned small business. Please indicate if you are a U.S.- or foreign-owned company.  In addition, please indicate whether your equipment and services are offered through the GSA schedule or any other government-wide agency contract. The Government will evaluate all responses objectively.  However, in the event the number of qualifying headsets offered in response to this RFI goes beyond the planned scope of the Government's project, the Government will down select candidates using results and recommendations from AMB's after-initiative report as a guide.  The Government will notify vendors selected for participation by 20 December 2002.

For evaluation purposes, Contractors submitting proposals are required to include not less than three (3) verifiable previous projects performed in the last two (2) years.  Past performance information shall be used in evaluation for award and should include sizes of projects, points of contacts and locations.  For the purposes of award, offers will be evaluated based upon the following factors, listed in descending order of importance:  (1) Past Performance and (2) Price.  Past performance will be evaluated using the following criteria in equal order of importance: customer satisfaction, quality, timeliness, responsiveness, subcontracts and management.  Price will be evaluated for realism, completeness and reasonableness.  The past performance factor noted in this section will be considered more important than price.  Offerors are cautioned that award may not be made to the Offeror submitting the lowest cost.  Offerors are also advised that award may be made without discussions or any contact concerning the proposal received.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted in the most favorable terms from both evaluation factors.

<DESC>The original statement of work was created as the implementation of NADEP Jacksonville Most Efficient Operation (MEO) to consolidate all the work under one contract and eliminate duplication of efforts and resources.  Therefore, in accordance with NADEP Jacksonville?s MEO to break out the statement of work for the additional effort is not practical nor realistic.  Any interested parties must submit an entire proposal in accordance with Note 22 within 45 days from the date of this synopsis.  The Government intends to award a modification to the existing contract to increase the labor hours of the following labor categories:  Production Controller  - 98,042 hours; Supply Technician ? 28,144 hours; Driver I ? 9,404 hours; Warehouse Specialist ? 2,952 hours and Inventory Clerk ? 155,040 hours.  The Government intends to award the modification to National Technologies Associates, Inc; 6601 Little River Turnpike, Suite 215, Alexandria, VA  22312.  Contract N00421-01-D-0024 was awarded to National Technologies Associates, Inc, (NTA) in March 2001 with the period of performance to begin 1 April 2001 to perform production support functions for the Naval Aviation Depot, Jacksonville, FL.   This contract was awarded as a total set-aside for small business competition with a Performance Based Statement of Work with fixed price monthly rates and time and material provisions for a base period of one year and two one-year options. These services are performed at various locations; Jacksonville, FL; Norfolk, VA; Beaufort, SC; Orange Park, FL; Cecil Field, FL; and Mayport, FL.  The Naval Air Depot, Jacksonville, FL has a requirement to increase labor for Option Year I under this contract as a result of accelerated schedules and increased demand, the man-hours forecasted in the production support services for the J-52, F-404, and TF34 engines, F-14 and EA-6B aircraft, and associated avionics electrical and mechanical components undergoing rework at the NADEP, are insufficient to meet the requirement.  All production divisions have recently gone to the twenty-four hours a day work schedule.  The existing available labor hours on the current Option Year I will be exhausted before January 2003.  The Government intends to increase the value of Option Year I under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(2) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements?. Due to the impact on national defense, the services must continue to be performed without interruption. See Note 22.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the direction of the Government.

<DESC>The Biomedical Imaging Program (BIP), Division of Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI) is reissuing this RFP to develop contracts to support Phase 1(Safety) and Phase 2(Preliminary Clinical Efficacy) clinical trials of promising imaging agents. These clinical trials will be used to rapidly evaluate the safety and diagnostic imaging capabilities of promising imaging probes, ligands, radiopharmaceuticals, and contrast agents that are of interest to NCI.  The Safety and Preliminary Clinical Efficacy Imaging Clinical Trials contracts will create an infrastructure poised to rapidly evaluate molecularly-targeted imaging agents used to assess therapeutic anticancer agents on their molecular targets and determine clinically relevant correlates.  The objectives of this program are:  to rapidly conduct clinical trials necessary to assess the safety of  promising  imaging agents;  to rapidly conduct clinical trials necessary to assess the diagnostic imaging capabilities and preliminary efficacy of  promising imaging agent to characterize the molecular interactions of new molecular imaging agents with  their targets through biopsies, assays, and other appropriate technologies and correlate those effects with clinically-relevant endpoints;  to develop new scientific insights into molecular pathways and determinants of  the relationship of the targeted imaging agents to therapeutic drug response.  Major emphasis shall be on imaging agents which are found to be safe and provide important structural, metabolic, or molecular imaging data which will be important and useful in the management of patients with cancer. These Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials will obtain the necessary data to fulfill the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria to eventually become an approved and potentially marketable imaging  agent for specific imaging indications. The studies will explore promising imaging agents, and require rapid initiation, completion, and data reporting.  These contracts will also require the ability to implement correlative studies validating the localization of the investigational imaging agents on their molecular target in tumors.  Imaging agents may originate from investigators not affiliated with clinical sites. The Government anticipates that three (3) contracts will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for four years.  The size of each trial might vary depending on consultation with the FDA for each specific agent.  The typical size for each Safety trail will be approximately 10 patients.    The typical size for each Preliminary Clinical Efficacy trail is estimated to be 25 patients.  NAICS Code No. 621512 with a size standard of $11.5.Million.   The solicitation is scheduled for electronic release approximately December 18, 2002.  The RFP may be accessed through internet address http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/.  It is the offeror?s responsibility to monitor the above internet site for the release of this solicitation and amendments, if any.  POTENTIAL OFFEROR?S WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory,  Propulsion Directorate (AFRL/PR ) solicits research proposals for the Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engine (VAATE) Phase I Program. (1)  The VAATE Program is a joint DoD/NASA/DOE/Industry effort to develop revolutionary and innovative technologies by the 2017 timeframe that will permit an order of magnitude increase in turbo propulsion affordability over the year 2000 state-of-the-art technology.  To achieve this goal Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) Propulsion Directorate and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate have committed resources to the development of an advanced technology base for materials, aero-thermodynamics and innovative structures, the development of advanced components, and the assessment and verification of these components in demonstrator engines.  The VAATE Program is structured in two phases to achieve 6X (2010) and 10X (2017) increases in affordability.  Major U.S. turbine engine and weapon system contractors have planned or are currently planning their future turbo propulsion research and development consistent with the goals of the VAATE Program.  Prospective offerors shall have a DoD-coordinated VAATE plan, shall develop one prior to proposal submittal, or shall have a documented working relationship with a company with a DoD-coordinated VAATE plan. Efforts sought under this announcement should address turbine engine technologies necessary to meet the VAATE Phase I goals and/or provide for supersonic (Mach 2-4) long range strike capability.  The goals shall be met by addressing both the numerator and denominator of the VAATE Capability/Cost Index (CCI) in a balanced manner. Note that there are separate VAATE goals for each engine class. The desired technical effort should consist of one or more advanced technology component development tasks that may include materials development, preliminary and detailed design, fabrication, assembly, instrumentation, component rig testing, core demonstrator testing, engine demonstrator testing, data analysis, and reporting.  Tasks shall be proposed in at least one of the following three VAATE Focus Areas: Durability, Intelligent Engine, and Versatile Core. Tasks may address such technical areas as advanced materials, fuel enhancements, thermal management systems, power generation systems, mechanical systems, inlet and exhaust systems, controls/accessories and engine health management systems, compression systems, combustors/augmentors, and turbines.  Consideration of integrated propulsion and power design features shall be included.  Materials characterization, tailoring, processing and behavior may be included in this effort to the extent that it is related to the development of advanced turbine engine components or issues associated with durability.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division intends on acquiring for Device 15F8H S/N 4, an E-2C Hawkeye 2000 Mission Computer Upgrade/Advanced Controller Indicator Set (MCU/ACIS) Weapons Systems Trainer (WST), modifications to a full Hawkeye 2000 configuration including the incorporation of Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), 15-Ton Vapor Cycle, ARC-210, SATCOM, Multi-mission Advance Tactical Terminal (MATT), new Electronic Support Measures (ALQ-217) and the Main Power Distribution.  The estimated delivery date to the Naval Station Norfolk, VA is November 2005.  As the Government does not and will not timely possess an accepted and validated technical data package to pursue a competitive acquisition strategy, it intends on pursuing a sole-source acquisition strategy to NLX Corporation, Sterling, VA.  NLX Corporation is currently tasked under contract N61339-99-C-0084 to design, develop and fabricate a Hawkeye 2000 WST (Device 15F8H S/N 5) which is a follow-on to Device 15F8H S/N 4.  However, the Device 15F8H S/N 5 tasking is inclusive of the design, development and integration of the full Hawkeye 2000 configuration whereas the Device 15F8H Serial Number 4 tasking does not possess these enhancements.  This undertaking will retrofit the enhancements into Device 15F8H S/N 4.  See Note 22.

<CONTACT>JOSHUA BOWERS, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, Phone (513)487-2104, Fax (513) 487-2109, Email BOWERS.JOSHUA@EPA.GOV
<DESC>The U.S. EPA, National Center for Environmental Assessment, located in Research Triangle Park, NC, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Brigham Young University Dept. of Chemistry & Biochemistry under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 to measure Semivolatile Particulate Matter. The project entails a comparison of measurement of total and semivolatile and nonvolatile components of particulate matter (PM) with a new technique with potential for measurement of total PM mass and with the EPA speciation sampler for organic PM mass, explanation of differences between these methods, and provision to EPA of certain materials needed for collection of semivolatile and nonvolatile organic PM matter. In this project, EPA seeks to have 1) a comparison of the RAMS and the differential TEOM conducted at a monitoring site near the contractor, 2) a comparison of the EPA speciation sampler OC with NV OC and SV OC measured with a sampler using a denuder and a sandwich filter that measures both components of OC PM, and 3) provision of carbon-impregnated glass fiber filters and carbon-impregnated material for use as a denuder for use in EPA field and laboratory studies.

This notice is not a request for quotations. EPA source research indicates BYU is the only known contractor with the appropriate level of technical knowledge necessary to complete this project.   BYU has developed several new techniques and demonstrated them in field studies.  EPA wishes to obtain additional information on SV PM including: 1) comparison of the BYU Real-time Ambient Mass Sampler (RAMS), a continuous monitor for total (NV + SV) PM mass, with the differential TEOM, a new instrument developed by R&P that has the potential for measuring NV and SV PM mass, 2) additional studies comparing OC collected by EPA speciation samplers (which have positive and negative artifacts of unknown magnitude) with SV and NV OC collected by a new technique developed at BYU, and 3) assistance to EPA by providing material needed to collect NV and SV OC in field and laboratory studies.  The group at BYU is the only research group that has the necessary equipment (RAMS for continuous NV + SV monitoring, the PC-BOSS and the Big-BOSS for collection of sufficient NV and SV material to allow composition analyses on the order of several hour time intervals, which is need to understand differences between the RAMS and the TEOM), staff trained and experienced in use of the equipment and the chemical analysis of the collected samples, and with demonstrated interest in the problems of measuring and understanding the role of SV PM in air pollution. 

However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of completing such work. Any such documentation must be submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice (before December 11, 2002 at 5:00 PM EST).  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order  based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA):  The Precision Strike Program Office, Air Armament Center (AAC), intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to modify the MK-84 General Purpose (GP) Bomb Case so that it will be more compliant with the Insensitive Munition (IM) requirements of MIL-STD-2105B.  FAR Part 15 procedures will be used to award to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements and will provide the best value to the government considering past performance, mission capability, proposal risk, and cost/price.  The government intends to award one or more contracts for Concept Technology & Development (CTD) with options for Weapon Qualification.  The contractor will be responsible for modifying and delivering an improved MK-84 bomb case for testing.  The Capabilities Threshold Minimums of the MK-84 IM Technology Program are: 1.  Equal or better operational performance (Pk) than the current GP bomb filled with the explosive Tritonal.  2.  Equal or better IM response than the current GP bomb filled with the explosive PBXN-109, currently used by the US Navy (BLU-117).  3.  The modified MK-84 bomb will maintain compatibility with the USAF inventory of fuzes (and those currently under development) as well as all tail kits and guidance packages.  4.  Preserve the current MK-84 bomb mass properties, thereby minimizing flight recertification.  The Capabilities Threshold Maximums are: 1.  Fully meet IM requirements for the MK-84 bomb.  2.  Reduce the current Hazard Classification from 1.1 to either 1.2.3 or 1.6.  The solicitation will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 13 Dec 2002.  Any questions pertaining to this solicitation should be addressed in writing by e-mail or fax to Steve Taylor, Contract Specialist at e-mail address steven.taylor@eglin.af.mil or fax 850-882-0877.  See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) and Fixed Submarine Broadcast System (FSBS) KG-30 CRYPTO MODERNIZATION. Sources Sought Synopsis. The purpose of this synopsis is to obtain program recommendations from Industry to support modernization of the KG-30 family of cryptologic devices through a combination of replacement and reprogramming cryptographic key generators used in the Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) and Fixed Submarine Broadcast System (FSBS) Nuclear C2 Communications Systems. This constitutes a continuation of overall Crypto Modernization efforts. Modernization will be required for the following cryptologic devices: KG-33, KG-34, KGV-61, KGV-61A, KOV-17, and KOV-17-1. These devices are integrated into the following platforms: E-4B, E-6B, B-52, Minuteman Launch Control Centers, Navy SSN and SSBN submarines and their tenders, Navy shore broadcast stations, and all associated labs and trainers. The purpose of this synopsis is to request Industry to provide a White Paper recommending: 1) potential areas for study to benefit the Government; 2) potential design/technical approaches, to include recommendations for use of GFE Programmable Embedded INFOSEC Product (PEIP) II or other commercially available crypto core, recommended approach for key management architecture, and recommended technique for handling multiple algorithms simultaneously; 3) impact of variations of equipment requiring upgrade and possible life-cycle cost reduction approaches based on use of available technology; 4) potential cost drivers and recommended strategies to optimize cost for the Government; 5) approach to interfacing with legacy systems; 6) program risk areas; 7) innovative management approaches and acquisition strategy to achieve technical requirements within the proposed acquisition approach to meet user need dates include major milestones and equipment delivery dates; 8) required GFE/GFI and estimated need dates; and 9) any additional detail useful in developing a successful acquisition strategy. The basis of information needed to prepare the White Paper is information provided by the Government to Industry at the KG-3X Industry Day held on 19-20 Nov 2002. Specific information regarding the PEIP II core engine is also provided, along with rules for communicating with the Naval Research Laboratory concerning PEIP II. Interested companies who were not able to attend the Industry Day can review all relevant program information currently available electronically on the Hanscom Electronic Resources Bulletin Board (HERBB) at www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil. The Government may use these White Papers to determine offerors' competitiveness for potential future source selections. The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought request. White Papers should be submitted electronically to the PCO, Mr. Tim Frank, at Tim.Frank@Hanscom.af.mil, with courtesy copy to the buyer, Lt. Michelle R. Hatcher, at Michelle.Hatcher@hanscom.af.mil in a rich text format no later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time, 13 December 2002. White Papers shall not exceed 15 one-sided, 8.5 X 11 inch pages in no smaller than ten point font. Title page and table of content page (if used) shall not be considered to be part of the 15-page limit. Attachments will not be evaluated. Charts, diagrams, pictures etc. shall be considered when embedded within the 15 allotted pages. Offerors should identify whether they intend to participate in the KG-3X Modernization effort as a prime contractor/integrator or as a subcontractor.  All small business and disadvantaged sources should identify themselves as such. We remind companies deciding to pursue proposing on the Crypto Modernization - KG-3X effort in any prime, subcontractor or teaming arrangement capacity of their responsibility to ensure they address and take steps to avoid and/or mitigate any potential Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) issues.  This is especially important if a company is presently supporting the Government through an Advisory and Assistance Services Contract.  Guidance is found in FAR Part 9 and possibly, OCI clauses in other Government contracts your company may have.  The BPAs for ESC ITSP contracts have specific provisions in addition to the FAR Part 9 guidance.  A potential OCI issue exists for any company that has personnel in any of its divisions working under contract for the Government and, therefore through them, has access to KG-3X related information originating either from the Government or from other interested companies.  Such companies should examine any support contracts it has in place with the Government for provisions addressing OCI issues.  A company finding it has a potential OCI situation must submit and have approved a mitigation plan prior to engaging in any activities relating to the acquisition.  Since the approval process can be lengthy and approval of any plan is not assured, it is highly recommended that potential OCI identification and resolution processes begin as soon in this pre-award phase as possible.  An OCI may result in the canceling of an order or determining an offeror ineligible for award.  Companies should contact 2Lt Michelle R. Hatcher, (781) 377-8902, with any questions they may have in this matter. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal, nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. A contract will not be awarded as a result of this announcement. For technical questions concerning this effort contact the KG-30 Family Modernization program manager, Capt Steven Lang, ESC/NDMS, Hanscom AFB MA, commercial (781) 377-8974, fax (781) 377-8553, Steven.Lang@hanscom.af.mil. The contracting point of contact (buyer) is Lt. Michelle Hatcher, ESC/NDK, (781) 377-8902, Michelle.Hatcher@hanscom.af.mil.

Request for Information for Design of an Interactive Computer Driven Simulation Environment Modeling the Navy?s Enlisted Processing System

1.0 SUBJECT

This is a request for information (RFI) to develop an interactive (i.e. man-in-the-loop) computer assisted SIMulation modeling the business processes among three inter-related Navy groups, (1) Navy Personnel Plans & Policy (N13), (2) Commander, Navy Recruiting Command (CNRC) and (3) Chief of Naval Education and Training (CNET).  The purpose of the simulation exercise is to determine impact of policy changes using a systems approach.  The simulation is designated SimPPRT.

2.0 DESCRIPTION

CNRC is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development and deployment of an interactive computer driven simulation, SimPPRT.  The simulation should enable the Navy?s Personnel triumvirate to participate in ?war gaming? sessions to test how proposed polices and budgetary decisions will impact the flow of Sailors through the initial training pipeline.  This should include simulating the impact on the recruit market and the flows through boot camp and ?A? school.  Such simulation games have been widely used to both train and evaluate combat.  To date the application of this technology to personnel situations has been limited.  

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

&#61607; Conceptual technical alternatives for a computer assisted simulation
&#61607; Technical feasibility assessments
&#61607; Approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.)
&#61607; Schedule estimates
&#61607; Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, operating, and managing SimPPRT.

3.0 REQUIREMENTS

This section enumerates the high-level functional requirements for SimPPRT.  For purposes of responding to the RFI an information exchange meeting will be held for interested parties (see Section 5.0 below). 

&#61607; SimPPRT must allow for each Navy personnel group to interact with the simulation in the conduct of simulated exercises (?war games?) from diverse locations (presumably via the Internet) in real-time mode.
&#61607; In addition to operating in an interactive mode, SimPPRT must have the capability to operate in a constructive context.  This capability can be either stochastic or deterministic.
&#61607; Access to SimPPRT must be platform independent and controlled by username and password.  It should allow users to logon independently or in-group sessions.
&#61607; SimPPRT must have the capability to save scenarios and a replay capability storing these scenarios in a library for future reference.  Users will be able to designate their scenarios as public or private.
&#61607; SimPPRT must be designed in modules that are capable of being run either independently or in concert.
&#61607; The modules should cover the planning process, the recruiting process and the training process.
&#61607; The planning module should model the impact of external events on requirements and resources and should handle the interactions between the other modules to minimize disturbances in the system.
&#61607;  The recruiting module should model the market supply and placement of recruits into the training pipeline with the appropriate quantity, quality and timing.
&#61607; The training module should model how recruiting results along with changes in resources and requirements impact training capacity and affect awaiting instruction time.
&#61607; SimPPRT must produce standard reports detailing all assumptions and pertinent results of scenarios.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-03-00033, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This synopsis is an amendment to the synopsis issued under the same RFQ number and posted on November 22, 2002.  Please note that the  submission date for quotes has been extended until December 12, 2002.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a  size standard of $5 million to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  This solicitation is 100 percent set aside for small business.   A firm, fixed-price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  The contractor shall provide EPA with a price on a per  sample (replicate) basis  based on the number of samples projected.  This procurement is for the analysis of up to 6000 samples for water column dissolved nutrients (2000) (complete list is below), water column total suspended sediments (1000 samples), sediment grain size (2000 samples), and  sediment total organic carbon (1000 samples) in accordance with protocols established by the National Coastal Assessment Program (Heitmuller, 2000).	The contractor shall supply EPA with a cost estimate on a per sample basis for each of the four categories of analysis for analysis of the stated  number of samples.  A minimum of one hundred (100) samples in each category will be guaranteed.	The  contractor is required to submit a copy of Quality Assurance/Quality Control protocols to the EPA contract officer prior to the analysis of the samples.  These protocols shall be the same as, or  exceed those described for the National Coastal Assessment Program. The contractor must agree to allow a QA audit of laboratory and or data entry procedures by an authorized agent of the EPA at any time (with advance notice).  The contractor is required to transfer copies of all technical, fiscal,  and programmatic files regarding this contract to the Project Officer.  These files shall be boxed in accordance with Federal Record Keeping Standards in boxes required by the Records Center and labeled as "National Coastal Assessment for Nutrients, Suspended Sediments, Sediment Grain Size and  Sediment TOC  - Contractor Name / Contract Number"  and contain an internal and external packing slip that identifies the specific contents of each box.  The external packing slip shall be affixed to the exterior of the box.  To ensure comparable data of acceptable quality, the National Coastal  Assessment (NCA) requires that all participating laboratories meet or exceed the following conditions and performance standards for the analyses of interest, whether conducted in-house or by a contract laboratory.  The methods described here are based on established analytical procedures that are  generally accepted and utilized in environmental studies. NCA acknowledges there have been advances in state-of-the-art for some of the methods; therefore, in keeping with EMAP's performance-based approach to QA/QC, laboratories are encouraged to use their best available technology.  However, prior  to approval,   proposed modifications or alternative methods shall first be review by NCA to ensure that the program's quality standards are met.   Required Methods and Quality Assurance Criteria for the Laboratory Determinations of: 1. Dissolved Nutrients, 2. Sediment Grain Size (Percent  Silt-Clay), 3.Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and 4. total Organic Carbon (TOC).  Nutrient Analysis -- Automated colorimetric methods for the determination of dissolved total Nitrogen, total Phosphorus, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, and ortho-phosphate (silicates optional) shall be conducted by using an autoanalyzer (e.g., Technicon AutoAnalyzer, or similar); the use of an autoanalyzer is required to process samples in an expeditious manner. Total N and total P may be digested using either acid or persulfate methodologies.  Nitrate concentration shall be determined 

indirectly by subtracting nitrite from nitrate+nitrite.  Instrument calibration shall be based on a 5-point standard curve for each nutrient analyte; calibration standards should bracket the concentration ranges of the field samples.  Samples should be analyzed in batches consisting of 10-15 field samples per batch along with the following required QC check samples: Laboratory blank, Spike/recovery check sample and Duplicate sample.  Because the NCA nutrient samples will span a wide range of salinities, it may be necessary to group field samples into general categories of salinity (e.g., 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, etc) and analyze a the various groups of samples against standards prepared with water of corresponding salinity.  Reporting units shall be in umole/L; samples shall be identified to the site by using the NCA site ID code; all samples must 

link to a designated batch; final data reports shall be submitted both electronically (asci delimited) and in hardcopy format.  See the specific quality assurance requirements in the Statement of Work posted on the website referenced at the end of the synopsis.  Sedminet Grain Size -- The NCA requires that sediment grain size be characterized only as percent silt-clay content.  The preferred method for determining percent silt-clay content is described in Section 5 (pp 3-6) of the EMAP- Laboratory Methods Manual-Estuaries,  Volume 1: Biological and Physical Analyses (US EPA, 1995); the manual is accessible on the EMAP website [www.epa.gov/emap] under EMAP Documents by Resource Groups.  See the specific quality assurance requirements in the Statement of Work posted on the website referenced at the end of 

the synopsis.  Determination of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) ? Laboratory processing consist primarily providing a tared filter to the field crews for processing the sample, once the processed filter is returned to the laboratory - drying the filter, then re-weighing to determine the weigh of residual material (suspended solids).  See the specific quality assurance requirements and preferred methods for determining TSS (and applicable reference websites) in the Statement of Work posted on the website referenced at the end of the synopsis.  Determination of Total Organic Carbon in Sediments -- The preferred method for determining TOC is described in the EMAP Laboratory Methods Manual Volume 1- Biological and Physical Analyses, Section 5 - Sediment Grain Size; available electronically on the EMAP website: www.epa.gov/emap).  Total 

organic carbon shall be determined by combusting pre-acidified samples at high temperature and measuring the volume of carbon dioxide gas produced (Salonen 1979b). Analytical procedures are generalized. Although the basic method used by various laboratories may be the same, instrumentation differences prohibit giving specific, step-by-step procedures.  See the specific quality assurance requirements in the Statement of Work posted on the website referenced at the end of the synopsis.  Data Reporting -- Final data reports shall be submitted in both hardcopy and electronic format; electronic data shall be in ASCII comma-delimited or formatted text.  Analytical results should be expressed as percent TOC; the laboratory shall report using the Coastal 2000 sample ID code; samples should be reported in designated batches along with the 

corresponding QA/QC data for each batch.  Equally weighted evaluation criteria to be included (with your quotation) in paragraph (a) of provision 52.212-2 are as follows: 1.) Provide a copy of QA/QC protocols,ncluding plans for replication  of analyses  2.) Demonstrate previous experience with estuarine nutrient and  sediment samples 3.) Demonstrate previous analytical experience with NS&T, EMAP or similar programs 4.) Provide  a brief explanation of methods used for each CLIN, with references 5.) Demonstrate experience with similar  size/scope projects 6.) Demonstrated capability to be able to meet the deadlines for the project 7.) Proposed plan to submit a final report (electronic format) as required 8.)

This solicitation is 100 percent set aside for small business.

  A firm, fixed-price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  The contractor shall provide EPA with a price on a per sample (replicate) basis  based on the number of samples projected.  This procurement is for the analysis of up to 6000 samples for water column dissolved nutrients (2000) (complete list is below), water column total suspended sediments (1000 samples), sediment grain size (2000 samples), and sediment total organic carbon (1000 samples) in accordance with protocols established by the National Coastal Assessment Program (Heitmuller, 2000).	The contractor shall supply EPA with a cost estimate on a per sample basis for each of the four categories of analysis for analysis of the stated number of samples.  A minimum of one hundred (100) samples in each category will be guaranteed.	The 

contractor is required to submit a copy of Quality Assurance/Quality Control protocols to the EPA contract officer prior to the analysis of the samples.  These protocols shall be the same as, or exceed those described for the National Coastal Assessment Program. The contractor must agree to allow a QA audit of laboratory and or data entry procedures by an authorized agent of the EPA at any time (with advance notice).  The contractor is required to transfer copies of all technical, fiscal, and programmatic files regarding this contract to the Project Officer.  These files shall be boxed in accordance with Federal Record Keeping Standards in boxes required by the Records Center and labeled as "National Coastal Assessment for Nutrients, Suspended Sediments, Sediment Grain Size and Sediment TOC  - Contractor Name / Contract Number" 

and contain an internal and external packing slip that identifies the specific contents of each box.  The external packing slip shall be affixed to the exterior of the box.  To ensure comparable data of acceptable quality, the National Coastal Assessment (NCA) requires that all participating laboratories meet or exceed the following conditions and performance standards for the analyses of interest, whether conducted in-house or by a contract laboratory.  The methods described here are based on established analytical procedures that are generally accepted and utilized in environmental studies. NCA acknowledges there have been advances in state-of-the-art for some of the methods; therefore, in keeping with EMAP's performance-based approach to QA/QC, laboratories are encouraged to use their best available technology.  However, prior to approval,  

proposed modifications or alternative methods shall first be review by NCA to ensure that the program's quality standards are met.   Required Methods and Quality Assurance Criteria for the Laboratory Determinations of: 1. Dissolved Nutrients, 2. Sediment Grain Size (Percent Silt-Clay), 3.Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and 4. total Organic Carbon (TOC).  Nutrient Analysis -- Automated colorimetric methods for the determination of dissolved total Nitrogen, total Phosphorus, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, and ortho-phosphate (silicates optional) shall be conducted by using an  autoanalyzer (e.g., Technicon AutoAnalyzer, or similar); the use of an autoanalyzer is required to process samples in an expeditious manner. Total N and total P may be digested using either acid or persulfate methodologies.  Nitrate concentration shall be determined  indirectly by subtracting  nitrite from nitrate+nitrite.  Instrument calibration shall be based on a 5-point standard curve for each nutrient analyte; calibration standards should bracket the concentration ranges of the field samples.  Samples should be analyzed in batches consisting of 10-15 field samples per batch along  with the following required QC check samples: Laboratory blank, Spike/recovery check sample and Duplicate sample.  Because the NCA nutrient samples will span a wide range of salinities, it may be necessary to group field samples into general categories of salinity (e.g., 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, etc) and  analyze a the various groups of samples against standards prepared with water of corresponding salinity.  Reporting units shall be in umole/L; samples shall be identified to the site by using the NCA site ID code; all samples must  link to a designated batch; final data reports shall be submitted  both electronically (asci delimited) and in hardcopy format.  See the specific quality assurance requirements in the Statement of Work posted on the website referenced at the end of the synopsis.  Sedminet Grain Size -- The NCA requires that sediment grain size be characterized only as percent  silt-clay content.  The preferred method for determining percent silt-clay content is described in Section 5 (pp 3-6) of the EMAP- Laboratory Methods Manual-Estuaries,  Volume 1: Biological and Physical Analyses (US EPA, 1995); the manual is accessible on the EMAP website [www.epa.gov/emap] under  EMAP Documents by Resource Groups.  See the specific quality assurance requirements in the Statement of Work posted on the website referenced at the end of  the synopsis.  Determination of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) ? Laboratory processing consist primarily providing a tared filter to the field  crews for processing the sample, once the processed filter is returned to the laboratory - drying the filter, then re-weighing to determine the weigh of residual material (suspended solids).  See the specific quality assurance requirements and preferred methods for determining TSS (and applicable  reference websites) in the Statement of Work posted on the website referenced at the end of the synopsis.  Determination of Total Organic Carbon in Sediments -- The preferred method for determining TOC is described in the EMAP Laboratory Methods Manual Volume 1- Biological and Physical Analyses,  Section 5 - Sediment Grain Size; available electronically on the EMAP website: www.epa.gov/emap).  Total  organic carbon shall be determined by combusting pre-acidified samples at high temperature and measuring the volume of carbon dioxide gas produced (Salonen 1979b). Analytical procedures are  generalized. Although the basic method used by various laboratories may be the same, instrumentation differences prohibit giving specific, step-by-step procedures.  See the specific quality assurance requirements in the Statement of Work posted on the website referenced at the end of the synopsis.   Data Reporting -- Final data reports shall be submitted in both hardcopy and electronic format; electronic data shall be in ASCII comma-delimited or formatted text.  Analytical results should be expressed as percent TOC; the laboratory shall report using the Coastal 2000 sample ID code; samples  should be reported in designated batches along with the  corresponding QA/QC data for each batch.  Equally weighted evaluation criteria to be included (with your quotation) in paragraph (a) of provision 52.212-2 are as follows: 1.) Provide a copy of QA/QC protocols, i including plans for replication of analyses  2.) Demonstrate previous experience with estuarine nutrient and  sediment samples 3.) Demonstrate previous analytical experience with NS&T, EMAP or similar programs 4.) Provide 

a brief explanation of methods used for each CLIN, with references 5.) Demonstrate experience with similar size/scope projects 6.) Demonstrated capability to be able to meet the deadlines for the project 7.) Proposed plan to submit a final report (electronic format) as required 8.)

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Charleston, (Code 36) is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) seeking input on alternative (other than internal combustion technologies) power systems which can be deployed and achieve operation both within and outside the continental United States by the end of year 2005.  The RFI seeks information on any known technological, regulatory, and institutional gaps between the current state of the art and the technology necessary to meet conditions to deploy new alternative (other than internal combustion technologies) power generation equipment.  The RFI is intended to solicit responses from alternative power generation equipment manufacturers, architect-engineering companies, and operating companies, in government, industry or academia with information or views on the conditions and equipment necessary for the generation of power.  This concept must be based upon, alternative energy sources, modular design which results in increased power as systems are added (i.e. one system generates 5KW, add-on system generates 5KW for a total of 10KW). THIS RFI IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR ULTIMATELY AWARD A CONTRACT. RESPONSES WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED AS PROPOSALS NOR WILL ANY AWARD BE MADE AS A RESULT OF THIS SYNOPSIS.  Section 1.  Information on specific candidates are asked to show how their systems meet the following criteria.  1.  Credible plan for modular capability to meet varying power requirements under varying environmental conditions.  2.  Demonstrate that a credible set of component suppliers and engineering resources exist today; or a credible plan exists to assemble them.  3.  Supporting Information:  Respondents are encouraged to provide any additional inputs, comments, and recommendations, as they may desire.

<SUBJECT>RFI - Data Mining and Crime Analysis Software Tools
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) - The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWAR) Charleston, is seeking information concerning commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) Data Mining and Crime Analysis (DM/CA) products. The purpose of this RFI is to invite vendors of DM/CA products to submit profiles of their products to SPAWAR for consideration or inclusion in a National Institute of Justice catalog of DM/CA vendors. The catalog will be published (for information purposes only) at the national level for review by public entities interested in DM/CA tools. All information received will be treated as public knowledge, therefore, vendors should not submit proprietary information in response to this RFI. The focus of this RFI is on software that supports the mining and interoperability of Intelligence, Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement data stores for use by crime analysis tools. As examples, the tools may include the following functionality: 1) Trend, Predictive, and Pattern Analysis; 2) Multi Field query capability; 3) Create, save and re-use queries; 4) Integration with multiple distributed data sources and data types; 5) Application Program Interface accessible by Crime Analysis applications and tools; 6) User defined and preformatted reports; 7) Partition data based on user profiles. The availability of DM/CA tools is needed to support crime analysis applications of local, regional, and state law enforcement agencies as well as some federal criminal justice agencies. DM/CA tools would normally be designed to operate on a small to large network owned and maintained by various levels of local, state and federal governments. Some agencies may benefit from web-served solutions that do not require them to install and maintain a network for an application that is used infrequently. The software should be an open design to support integration into common network configurations. This announcement is for information gathering purposes. Submittals: Respondents are welcome to provide information in the form of product brochures, press releases, technical specification sheets, independent assessment results, reprints of trade journal articles, etc. Submissions should include pertinent company information, including contact person, phone number, fax number and email address. Responses to this RFI should be mailed to: SPAWARSYSCEN Charleston, Attn: Code 741KB, P.O. Box 190022, N. Charleston, SC, 29419-9022. Please provide 3 copies of any printed material. This RFI is for planning purposes only, and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation of an offer. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

<SUBJECT>A -- Cadet Summer Research Program
<DESC>The United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) announces opportunities for partnerships in cooperative research through our Cadet Summer Research Program for the summer of 2003.  The program is designed to gives cadets real-world, hands-on research experience at the partners research facility.  By working side by side with leading military, government, and civilian researchers, cadets learn to apply the knowledge they gained in the classroom in ways that greatly enhance their preparation to become Air Force officers. 

The research program is slated to last for five weeks beginning in late May and involves cadets who have completed three years of university education at USAFA.  Some cadets will be allowed to expand their program to eight weeks.  The partner typically pays for the cadet?s travel, per diem and lodging expenses. Exceptions to this are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  USAFA continues to pay the cadet?s salary and benefits.  Non-federal agencies will execute a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement as defined in 15 U.S.C. 3710a where appropriate.

Possible research areas are open-ended.  Cadets in the following majors will participate in the program:
 
Aeronautical Engineering
Astronautical Engineering
Basic Sciences
Behavioral Science
Biology
Chemistry to include Biochemistry and Materials Science
Civil Engineering
Computer Science
Economics
