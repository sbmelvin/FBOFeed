<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to solicit proposals from Phase 2 contractors for the PROPTOTYPE PHASE (Phase 3) of a miniature loop heat pipe (mLHP). One of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's technology development projects is miniaturization of a two-phase heat transport system for Nano-satellites and related applications.  Previous work has successfully demonstrated operation of mLHP's with evaporator diameters near 1/4".  The intent of this effort is to develop a reduced scale mHLP with dual parallel evaporators and dual parallel condensers in separate radiators. The system should operate in typical spacecraft temperature ranges and be able to transport approximately 100 Watts. Complete specifications are attached to this notice. THIS SOLICITATION IS FOR THE PROTOTYPE PHASE (Phase 3).  The design phase (phase 1) was synopsized in July 2001 and completed in July 2002, the breadboard phase was synopsized in February 2002 and completed in October 2002. This requirement was advertised as a 3-phase procurement using a progressive competition down-selection technique between phases.  The competition for phase 3 will be based on the results of Phase 2, and the award criteria for Phase 3 will include successful completion of Phase 2 requirements. Notwithstanding NASA's expectation that only the Phase 2 contractors will be capable of successfully competing for Phase 3, proposals from all responsible sources submitted by the specified due date will be considered.  Any other responsible source may indicate its desire to submit a proposal by responding to this Phase 3 synopses, and NASA will provide the source all the material furnished (SOW and Specs) to the Phase 1 and Phase 2 contractors necessary to submit a proposal. To be considered for Phase 3 award, offerors must demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to that of the Phase 2 contractors. This demonstration shall include the following deliverables required in Phase 1 and 2: Design Review package, including proposed design, preliminary drawings,parts and materials lists, cleaning and charge procedures, tests and analyses, performance capabilities, mechanical drawings of system and components, and the delivery of a breadboard mLHP with instrumentation and heaters attached.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 54171 and 1000, respectively.	All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about September 5, 2003 with an anticipated offer due date of on or about September 17, 2003.  For those contractors who desire a copy of the RFP, who are not Phase 2 contractors, send a request via e-mail to the POC listed below. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunities home page is   http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=51	Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a FP E-Q Motion Picture Studio Projector.

Competition is impractical because: Kinoton America Distribution is the only vendor that fully meets the required specifications for the product required by NASA, Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC).

Additionally, this projector has 8 adjustable preset projection speeds (1-6-12-18-20-24-48) and has a mode of infinitely variable projections speed (10-30 fps) via potentiometer control jog.  Another important requirement is that this projector has still frame projection mode for single frame evaluation with no time limit and not damaging the film by overheating. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. Central Standard Time on September 10, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce, Office of the Secretary intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1) and 41 USC 253(c)(3), with Mitretek Systems, Falls Church, Virginia for services in support of information technology policy development and technical review.   The Department seeks a contractor to conduct an objective, independent, knowledgeable, rigorous, and in-depth review and analysis of information technology (IT) policy and project documentation, IT technical statements of work and proposals, and IT management issues.  The sole source justification is based on the government’s need that the contractor not have any conflicting role that might bias its judgment in carrying out tasks under this contract, and that the contractor not be in a position to gain or be perceived as gaining an unfair competitive advantage as a result of conducting tasks under this contract for the Department of Commerce.  This applies not only to the contractor but to any other organization that has or is perceived to have a business relationship with the contractor that may lead to a conflict of interest.  The proposed contractor, Mitretek, is a 501(c)(3) corporation chartered to work exclusively in the public interest.  As stated in its articles of incorporation, the nature of Mitretek=s business is exclusively charitable, educational, and scientific.  Its primary purpose is Ato carry on scientific research in the public interest in order to provide a public benefit through the application of science and technology Y@  Mitretek has no stockholders, but is administered as a public trust by a board of trustees made up of eminent citizens. Mitretek, as a nonprofit corporation chartered to work exclusively in the public interest, operates in a manner that meets the spirit and specific requirements of the conflict of interest avoidance criteria stated above.  Mitretek does not manufacture or promote any commercial products, does not provide routine services (such as computer system operations), and does not work for or formally compete against profit-seeking firms.  In addition to the above safeguards against organizational conflict of interest, Mitretek has in place corporate policies and procedures that guard against individual trustees=, officers=, and employees= personal interests conflicting with Mitretek=s work.  Based on its corporate capabilities and demonstrated experience, Mitretek is also well qualified to provide the technical policy support work necessary to meet this requirement.  Mitretek is uniquely qualified to meet the Department’s requirements.***The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 54151, and the size standard is $21 million.*** This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue an award under other than full and open competition procedures and should not be considered a request for competitive proposals.  Information received by June 9, 2003 will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The determination not to open the subject requirement to competition is made solely at the discretion of the Government.***Questions regarding this notice shall be sent to Donna Calacone, Contract Specialist.  E-mail address:  dcalacone@doc.gov.

<DESC>NA The New York District of the United States Army Corps of Engineers intends to issue a contractual document to Bell Constructors, Inc. under existing Contract No. DACA51-02-C-0039, providing for the installation of a gas distribution line under the Wheeler Sack Army Airfield runways at the Fort Drum Airfield Area located at Fort Drum, New York.  This notification serves two purposes:  1) To provide notification under FAR 6.302-1, Sole Source, of the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s intent to contract solely with the previo usly named contractor; 2) To allow potential subcontractors to solicit the prime contractor for subcontracting opportunities.    Description of Services Install a new 12-inch diameter primary gas line across the Ft Drum airfield runway area. Work will include 2 tie-ins to other contractor installed gas lines. This line will be installed concurrently within a common trench in conjunction with a 16-inch diam eter water line.  Work will be within the limited access space in the airfield area, with work hours dependent on air space restrictions set by deployment and training requirements, tight security restrictions and coordination of the existing contractors w ork in this area.  This work also requires four horizontal borings, ranging from 150 to 450 feet in length under the existing primary runways and taxiways.  Due to the critical nature of the airfield operations the contractor to perform this work will be r esponsible for any settlement, disruptions or failures to the airfield pavements.  This high risk task will require that the prime contractor possess or subcontract to a firm that possesses the clear ability to execute this type of work under these extreme  conditions and within a performance schedule of three weeks and starting the work by 15 September 2003.  Routine shut down of work may be required in order to meet the Ft Drum Airfield deployment and training missions.  The reason for this sole source contract to Bell ConstructorÃ¢Â€Â™s Inc., is that Bell ConstructorÃ¢Â€Â™s Inc is mobilized, performing the installation of the 16Ã¢Â€Â water main across the heavily used Ft Drum Airfield at this time and are installing a la rge quantity if gas mains in the areas as well.  Bell has already obtained a highly experienced subcontractor to perform this high-risk horizontal boring work; only limited additional coordination would be needed to perform this additional work. They meet the security requirements, communication/coordination with airfield operations, possess approved/in place safety and quality control systems and is the only contractor that has the ability to start and complete this work within the performance schedule req uired to meet the Ft Drum airfield deployment and training requirements.   The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or su bmit proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of d etermining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Points of contacts:  Alan P. Link, Lead Contract Specialist, (212) 264-6707, fax (212) 264-3013 and Edward Sim, Project Manager, (315) 772-4106.  E-mail or fax your questions to alan.p.link@usace.ar my.mil.

The offeror's proposal shall be in the form prescribed by this solicitation and shall contain a response to each of the areas identified, which affects the evaluation factors for award.  In accordance with the provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, the quote will be evaluated based on Past Performance and Price.  Past Performance is considered to be more important than Price.  
Due to the interrelationship of services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. All offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-commercial Items, with its offer.  The clause  at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

Invoices shall be mailed to: Naval Ophthalmic Support and Training Activity, 160 Main Rd, Ste 350, Yorktown, VA  23691-9984.   No purchase or award shall be made unless the contracting officer makes an affirmative determination of responsibility.  To be determined responsible, a prospective contractor must have adequate financial resources to perform the contract, or the ability to obtain them.  The contracting officer shall require acceptable evidence of the prospective contractor's current sound financial status, as well as the ability to obtain required resources if the need arises.  In regard to resources, the contractor must be prepared to present acceptable evidence of subcontracts, commitments or explicit arrangement that will be in existence at the time of contract award, to rent, purchase, or otherwise acquire the needed facilities, equipment, services, materials, other resources, or personnel.  Consideration of a prime contractor's compliance with limitations on subcontracting shall be taken into account for the time period covered by the contract base period or quantities, plus option periods or quantities, if such options are considered when evaluating offers for award. 
       Pursuant to FAR 9.104-4, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to request adequate evidence of responsibility on the part of any prospective subcontractor(s). 
       In the absence of information clearly indicating that the prospective contractor is responsible, the contracting officer shall make a determination of non-responsibility. 
       As a minimum requirement, all offerors must submit, as part of the original proposal, the following:  
            (1) Company's Financial Statement which includes Balance Sheet and Income Statement; and
            (2) Point of Contact from their Bank or any financial institution with which they transact business.
Number notes 22 applies.   

ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-1 - Instruction to Offerors - Commercial

Past Performance Evaluation Standards:  Offerors are required to provide information on no more than five (5) of the firm’s most recently completed Federal Government, State Government, Municipal Government, or commercial contracts (not to exceed five years since completion) for like or similar services to those to be provided under this RFQ.  Offerors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.  Offerors who present similar contracts/orders should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of the solicitation.  The offerors should provide the following information regarding past performance:

a)	Contract or purchase order number(s),
b)	Name and phone number of contact at the Federal, State, Local Government, or Commercial entity for which the contract was performed,
c)	E-mail address of point of contact (if known)
d)	Dollar value of the contract,
e)	Detailed description of the work performed,
f)	Names of subcontractor(s) used, if any, and a description of the extent of work performed by the subcontractor(s),
g)	The number, type, and severity of any quality, delivery, or cost problems in performing the contract, the corrective action taken, and the effectiveness of the corrective action, and
          
Offerors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance.  If the offeror possesses no relevant past performance, it should affirmatively state this fact.  A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the proposal with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the proposals of other offerors having acceptable (or better) past performance. 

Offerors are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry.  This information may include Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS) or past performance information from any source.  The evaluation will accurately summarize each telephone discussion on a Telephone Interview Report Form (Attachment 1).  A copy of the Telephone Interview Report Form will be promptly sent via fax or e-mail to the point of contact for verification.

The information contained in offeror's Past Performance submittals will be evaluated by the PCO with the assistance of the Contract Specialist. The PCO will evaluate the offeror's Past Performance using the following sub-factors, which are of equal importance.

(a)	Quality:  The offeror’s demonstrated history of delivering products and services of high quality. Quality will be evaluated in terms of: 

i.	customer satisfaction, 
ii.	instances of rework and/or deficiency reports, and 
iii.	evidence of effective and/or innovative work applications that were beneficial to the customer.

(b)	Timeliness: The offeror’s compliance with 

i.	performance schedules, 
ii.	timeliness of submission of requested information, reports and invoicing. 

(c)	Contractor Responsiveness:  The offeror’s demonstrated ability to 

i.	respond to customer concerns, 
ii.	isolate and resolve problems, and
iii.	take systemic improvement action.

Each performance risk assessment of the factors listed above will consider the number and severity of problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken and the overall work record.  

The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror’s performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information:

Very Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the offeror will very successfully perform the required effort.

Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 

Moderate Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  

High Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  

Neutral:  No relevant past performance history, or for which past performance information is not provided or available.  Unknown performance risk assessment.

Under most circumstances, it will be unnecessary to divulge the solicitation number, or other identifying information to the reference. In the event that it is necessary, you need to obtain a non-disclosure statement from the party to whom the information was provided.

Price:  The PCO will evaluate Price.  When the proposals are received, the PCO shall review the submission of offers as specified in FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors– Commercial Items (Oct 2000), paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(11).

Evaluation of Price Proposal: The offeror’s proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.404-1.  The evaluation may include, but is not limited to: 
a)	Price comparison with other offerors; 
b)	Completeness:  All pricing information as it directly relates to the SOW; and
c)	Comparison with independent Government estimates.

Increasing Significance of Price:  Although price is the least most important evaluation factor, it has the potential to become more significant during the evaluation process.  The degree of importance of the price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factor on which selection is to be based. The importance of price will also increase when a proposal's price is so significantly high as to diminish the value to the Government that might be gained under the other aspects of the offer.  If, at any stage of the evaluation, all offeror’s are determined to have submitted equal, or virtually equal, or generally equivalent, non-price proposals, price could become the factor in determining which offeror shall received the award.

Determination for Award to Best Value Offer:   

At the appropriate juncture in which the PCO will make a best value determination, the PCO shall engage in a best value determination in accordance with the evaluation criteria in the solicitation.  The PCO will review all of the proposals.  The PCO shall integrate the evaluation of Past Performance and Price.

Upon completion of this review, award will be made to the offeror whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, is considered most advantageous to the Government, considering past performance and price.  The basis for the PCO’s selection will be documented in the Source Selection Decision Memorandum.  Based upon the fact that this procurement will be performed in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5 – Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, the evaluation and documentation will reflect a Simplified Acquisition Procedure. 

The Government reserves the right to select an offeror with other than the best past performance, if the price is so advantageous to the Government as to constitute best value.  On the other hand, the Government may select an offeror with other than the lowest price if the quality of past performance and a fair and reasonable price of a competitor result in the greatest value to the Government.  Any such determination of best value will be made by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the evaluation criteria identified in this plan and the solicitation.

The closing date and time for this RFQ is 12 Sep 03, 1600 hrs. Fannie Richardson, the Contract Specialist may be contacted at 757 443-1398, for information regarding this RFQ.

OFFERORS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AND INCLUDE A COPY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS WITH THEIR PROPOSALS: FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications – Commercial Items. The government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the government considering price and price-related factors. 52.212-2  EVALUATION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS--OCT 1995 (a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the s olicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.   (I)    TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE  REQUIREMENT (ii)   PAST PERFORMANCE (iii)  PRICE Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below. Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be tech nically acceptable, Factor (ii) is approximately equal  to Factor (iii), PRICE.   At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.    (b)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical infor mation, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award.  (c)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS , Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  Offers  which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated w ith delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. (d)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (e)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract wi thout further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 54171   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) intends to negotiate on a Sole Source basis under the authority of FAR 6.301, with the University of Washington in St. Louis MO. for a method of synthesis and purification of carbon single and multi walled carbon nano tubes to produce engineered nano-materials.  These materials will be used for environmental and catalytic applications, particularly for adsorption uses, for hydrogen storage and as catalyst support for heterogeneous reactions of organic chemicals. The U.S. EPA requires carbon nanotubes for its  in-house research in the area  of catalysis and adsorption and to develop clean technologies.  If the new reactors prove effective, subsequent requirements can be competed to determine if other sources are capable of providing materials that meet EPA's requirements. The nature of the acquisition  requires a contractor that possesses the unique capability of system manufacturing in sufficient quantities and the analysis of the desired carbon nano tubes, and can provide the necessary characterization of these products to ensure the desired performance for environmental applications.  These  unique capabilities are essential for the contract performance in order to assure that the reactor parts are made according to the specifications and achieve the expected chemical and mechanical properties of the catalyst. All responsible and responsive vendors must be in compliance with Section  508 under the 1998 Amendments to the Rehabilitation Act.  The contractor shall offer only Electronic Information Technology which complies with EPA Information Resources Management Policy Manual, particularly to include the accessibility policy implementing Section 508 under the Rehabilitation Act  stated above.  Any contractor's response under this announcement indicates by his interest, quote or proposal that the offered product meets the accessibility requirements of individuals with disabilities, as applicable.  See http:/www.section508.gov; particularly Subpart B, Technical Standards,  1194.21 - 1194.26, Information, Documentation and Support. This notice of intent is not a request for quotations.  However, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the EPA's requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the requirements stated  above. Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contract within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete  this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This is a  full and open competition under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedure.  The applicable NAICS Code is 54171.  All interested responsible contractors may submit your Request for Quotation (RFQ) to this office NOT LATER THAN 15 days from the date of this posted notification to the:    U.S.  EPA, Attn:  Barbara A.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Jennifer Hill, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-3083
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-03-00421, and the solicitation is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal  Acquisition Circular 01-15.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541710, which has a size standard of 500 employees to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A firm, fixed-price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of  this  solicitation.  This procurement is for sediment dating of a total of 14 lake sediment cores collected as part of Western Airborne Contaminants Assessment Project (WACAP).  EPA shall deliver to the contractor approximately 1 gram of dry, homogenized sediment from each core slice for dating.  EPA  will supply the contractor with only one complete sediment core from each lake at any one time.  EPA will keep duplicate sliced cores from sampled lakes in reserve in their laboratory.  The contractor shall specify to EPA the exact requirements of the shipping containers to be used by EPA.  The  contractor shall analyze the sediment samples using non-destructive sediment dating and analytical techniques.  After an appropriate number of sediment slices from an entire core have been successfully dated by the contractor, aliquots from each  section of the core shall be labeled and returned  to EPA by the Contractor for metal analysis to be performed by EPA.  Therefore, it is imperative that the Contractor use extreme care in handling the sediments so that contamination of the sediment is avoided. Using gamma spectrometry, the contractor shall non-destructively process homogenized  sub-samples of sediment slices obtained from lake sediment cores to develop data to be used by the contractor to develop acceptable, unambiguous, chronological dating calculations for the core.  Given the small sample size available for the analysis, a well-type coaxial low background germanium  detector equipped with Na(I) escape suppression shields shall be used to provide a low detection limit (i.e. 0.01 Bq for both 210 Pb and 226 Ra).  A combination of naturally occurring radionuclides  (i.e.210Pb) as well as anthropogenically derived radionuclides associated with atmospheric testing  of thermo-nuclear weapons (i.e. 137Cs and 241Am) shall be used to calculate and verify sediment accumulation rates using the CRS (constant rate of 210Pb supply) and/or the CIC (constant initial concentration) models (Appleby and Oldfield, 1978, Robbins, 1978).  The latter may be most appropriate if  sediment discontinuities are present in a sediment core.  In some cases, a given sediment core may require application of the models using a piecewise approach due to discontinuities in the nature of the core.  The contractor shall apply these techniques and approaches as deemed appropriate given  the data accumulated during analysis of the core sections.  Each core shall be treated and approached using carefully applied testing and validation  methods on an individual case-by-case basis.  Three radionuclide records shall be examined to help in determining the quality of the sediment record  as well as its chronology.  Numerical techniques shall be applied in order to calculate cumulative dry mass in the core.  Dry mass of each section based on in situ volume will be provided by the USEPA to the contractor for each sediment slice at the time sediment is shipped to the Contractor.   Standard errors associated with calculated sediment dates shall be calculated and reported to the EPA by the Contractor.  The work will be divided into three periods based on the progress of the planned field sampling to be conducted by EPA.  The number of cores from different lakes to be dated by  the contractor shall be as follows:  Base Period ? 4 cores; Option Period 1 ? 4 cores, Option  Period 2 ? 6 cores.  Prior to initiating the work to date these cores, the contractor shall provide the EPA with a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) containing the following information: 1.0  Project  or Laboratory Description; 2.0  Project or Laboratory Organization and Responsibilities; 3.0  Quality Assurance Objectives;  list precision, accuracy, and detection limit objectives for measurements.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

On-site support shall be available for a minimum of three years given the potential life cycle of a specified investigation and litigation.  In addition, each storage device shall include a three-year on-site (in addition to the first year) warranty.  Estimated cost of this procurement is $70,571.00.

<DESC>The Government intends to award a contract under Other Than Full and Open Competition Procedures to Best Access Systems for the procurement of an Access control System and CCTV System.  This procurement is in accordance with FAR Subpart 13-5.  
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is N00189-03-T-0681 and it is issued as a Request For Quote (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15, dated 24 July 2003.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 561621 and the small business size standard is $10.5 millions.

The items shall be delivered on or before 31 Oct 03. Delivery is FOB destination to Norfolk, Virginia.    The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition. In accordance with the provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, the quote will be evaluated based on Past Performance and Price.  Past Performance is considered to be more important than Price.  
Due to the interrelationship of services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable.
All offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-commercial Items, with its offer.  The clause  
At 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statues Or Executive Orders-commercial Items applies to this acquisition. 
The following clauses apply:  52.217-8, Option to Extend Services;  252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests;  52.232-33 Payment By Electronic funds Transfer- Central Contractor Registration; and 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration.  Invoices shall be mailed to: Joint Forces Staff College, Supply Officer, Bldg SC-401, 7800 Hampton Blvd, Norfolk, VA.   No purchase or award shall be made unless the contracting officer makes an affirmative determination of responsibility.  To be determined responsible, a prospective contractor must have adequate financial resources to perform the contract, or the ability to obtain them.  The contracting officer shall require acceptable evidence of the prospective contractor's current sound financial status, as well as the ability to obtain required resources if the need arises.  In regard to resources, the contractor must be prepared to present acceptable evidence of subcontracts, commitments or explicit arrangement that will be in existence at the time of contract award, to rent, purchase, or otherwise acquire the needed facilities, equipment, services, materials, other resources, or personnel.  Consideration of a prime contractor's compliance with limitations on subcontracting shall be taken into account for the time period covered by the contract base period or quantities, plus option periods or quantities, if such options are considered when evaluating offers for award. 
       Pursuant to FAR 9.104-4, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to request adequate evidence of responsibility on the part of any prospective subcontractor(s). 
       In the absence of information clearly indicating that the prospective contractor is responsible, the contracting officer shall make a determination of non-responsibility. 
       As a minimum requirement, all offerors must submit, as part of the original proposal, the following:  
            (1) Company's Financial Statement which includes Balance Sheet and Income Statement; and
            (2) Point of Contact from their Bank or any financial institution with which they transact business.
Number notes 22 applies.   

ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-1 - Instruction to Offerors - Commercial

Past Performance Evaluation Standards:  Offerors are required to provide information on no more than five (5) of the firm’s most recently completed Federal Government, State Government, Municipal Government, or commercial contracts (not to exceed five years since completion) for like or similar services to those to be provided under this RFQ.  Offerors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.  Offerors who present similar contracts/orders should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of the solicitation.  The offerors should provide the following information regarding past performance:

a)	Contract or purchase order number(s),
b)	Name and phone number of contact at the Federal, State, Local Government, or Commercial entity for which the contract was performed,
c)	E-mail address of point of contact (if known)
d)	Dollar value of the contract,
e)	Detailed description of the work performed,
f)	Names of subcontractor(s) used, if any, and a description of the extent of work performed by the subcontractor(s),
g)	The number, type, and severity of any quality, delivery, or cost problems in performing the contract, the corrective action taken, and the effectiveness of the corrective action, and
          
Offerors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance.  If the offeror possesses no relevant past performance, it should affirmatively state this fact.  A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the proposal with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the proposals of other offerors having acceptable (or better) past performance. 

Offerors are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry.  This information may include Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS) or past performance information from any source.  The evaluation will accurately summarize each telephone discussion on a Telephone Interview Report Form (Attachment 1).  A copy of the Telephone Interview Report Form will be promptly sent via fax or e-mail to the point of contact for verification.

The information contained in offeror's Past Performance submittals will be evaluated by the PCO with the assistance of the Contract Specialist. The PCO will evaluate the offeror's Past Performance using the following sub-factors, which are of equal importance.

(a)	Quality:  The offeror’s demonstrated history of delivering products and services of high quality. Quality will be evaluated in terms of: 

i.	customer satisfaction, 
ii.	instances of rework and/or deficiency reports, and 
iii.	evidence of effective and/or innovative work applications that were beneficial to the customer.

(b)	Timeliness: The offeror’s compliance with 

i.	performance schedules, 
ii.	timeliness of submission of requested information, reports and invoicing. 

(c)	Contractor Responsiveness:  The offeror’s demonstrated ability to 

i.	respond to customer concerns, 
ii.	isolate and resolve problems, and
iii.	take systemic improvement action.

Each performance risk assessment of the factors listed above will consider the number and severity of problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken and the overall work record.  

The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror’s performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information:

Very Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the offeror will very successfully perform the required effort.

Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 

Moderate Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  

High Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  

Neutral:  No relevant past performance history, or for which past performance information is not provided or available.  Unknown performance risk assessment.

Under most circumstances, it will be unnecessary to divulge the solicitation number, or other identifying information to the reference. In the event that it is necessary, you need to obtain a non-disclosure statement from the party to whom the information was provided.

Price:  The PCO will evaluate Price.  When the proposals are received, the PCO shall review the submission of offers as specified in FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors– Commercial Items (Oct 2000), paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(11).

Evaluation of Price Proposal: The offeror’s proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.404-1.  The evaluation may include, but is not limited to: 
a)	Price comparison with other offerors; 
b)	Completeness:  All pricing information as it directly relates to the SOW; and
c)	Comparison with independent Government estimates.

Increasing Significance of Price:  Although price is the least most important evaluation factor, it has the potential to become more significant during the evaluation process.  The degree of importance of the price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factor on which selection is to be based. The importance of price will also increase when a proposal's price is so significantly high as to diminish the value to the Government that might be gained under the other aspects of the offer.  If, at any stage of the evaluation, all offeror’s are determined to have submitted equal, or virtually equal, or generally equivalent, non-price proposals, price could become the factor in determining which offeror shall received the award.

Determination for Award to Best Value Offer:   

At the appropriate juncture in which the PCO will make a best value determination, the PCO shall engage in a best value determination in accordance with the evaluation criteria in the solicitation.  The PCO will review all of the proposals.  The PCO shall integrate the evaluation of Past Performance and Price.

Upon completion of this review, award will be made to the offeror whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, is considered most advantageous to the Government, considering past performance and price.  The basis for the PCO’s selection will be documented in the Source Selection Decision Memorandum.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to solicitation SP4700-03-T-0043 is to respond to vendor questions received to date.  Question:  The Polycom ViewStation FX comes with a built-in "Wide Angle Lens" - do you desire an additional lens?  Answer:  No.  Question:  The PRI module is the CSU - do you desire an additional one as listed "ACE"?  Answer:  You will need a T1 CSU ACE.  The Mfg. Part number is 1202022L1.  Question:  Can I assume that the requested training be provided the same day and place as the quoted installation?  Answer:  Yes.  Question:  Is the Wega Trinitron monitor a requirement or is a Sony or JVC Monitor of equal size and S-Video input OK?  Answer:  Prefer to stick with the equipment that is on the order because it matches the other locations configuration.  Do not want anything which will interfere with our ability to communicate using the VTC.  Question:  Is the current (newer) document camera on the Polycom GSA schedule OK?  (that camera is the "ELMO EV-2000 Visual Presenter Document Camera") -  -  or is another "document camera" acceptable - - maybe even a ceiling mounted document camera such as the "CeilingVIEW" by Vaddio (http://www.vaddio.com/CeilingVIEW.pdf).  Answer:  Prefer to stick with the equipment that is on the order because it matches the other locations configuration.  Do not want anything which will interfere with our ability to communicate using the VTC.  Question:  Is the "Government" version of the Polycom ViewStation FX required (part number G2200-20323-001) or simply 2200-20323-001?? (There is a $500 price difference in the MSRP of the two).  Answer:  Prefer to stick with the equipment that is on the order because it matches the other locations configuration.  Do not want anything which will interfere with our ability to communicate using the VTC.  Question:  Is this a GSA purchase?  Answer:  No.  We are going open market only.  Question:  Can you provide the shipping address for the two locations?  Answer:  One System will be shipped to DLA Systems Integration Office, 5851 F Avenue, Bldg. 849, Room A66, Hill AFB, UT 84056 and the other system will be shipped to DLA Systems Integration Office, 2001 Mission Drive, Suite 2, New Cumberland, PA 17070.  For an offer to be considered acceptable you must submit a quote for BOTH systems as this is all or none for award.  Offers are due 15 September 2003, 2:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.  Deliver quote to Andrew T. McNamara Headquarters Complex, 8725 John J. Kingman Road, Suite 1145, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-6220 or fax to 703-767-1172 attention, Ms. Brenda Geist..

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) plans to conduct a standard competition on the Automated Flight Service Stations (AFSS) under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76.  The FAA plans to follow the intent of the Circular and will conduct the acquisition in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS).  The FAA does not utilize the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  Pursuant to Public Law 104-50 (the â€œ1996 DOT Appropriations Actâ€) the FAA was directed to develop and implement a new acquisition management system.  The FAA AMS took effect on April 1, 1996, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. sec. 40110(d).  A Screening Information Request (SIR)/Request for Information (RFI) on the AFSS Competitive Sourcing Study was posted on the FAAâ€™s Contracts Opportunity Web page on June 3, 2003.  The RFI was issued to survey the market and solicit input on specific topics from all interested parties for consideration during the Preliminary Planning process.  The list of 18 AFSS RFI SIR respondents including the Government, was posted on the FAAâ€™s web page on July 17, 2003 to facilitate timely and appropriate potential subcontracting and/or teaming opportunities. One-on-one sessions were offered to all interested parties and have been conducted on request. The FAA is posting this draft screening decision down-select SIR (SIR  1) to obtain comments from all interested parties for potential inclusion in the final SIR 1 version to be posted concurrently with or shortly after the Start Date (Public Announcement Date).  The Appendices to this the draft SIR will be provided with the final SIR 1 release.  All comments should be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer listed in Section 2.3 no later than September 19, 2003.

Approximately 4 million cubic yards of material to be dredged with characteristics of sand as a loose, unconsolidated material as well as materials tha t are typically calcitic and dolomitic in composition and exhibit some degree of lithification. Unconfined compressive strengths were up to 550 psi.  On a previous project, soils and rock similar to these materials were removed from a 100-foot widener in t he South Brunswick River channel using the 19-inch dredge STUART.  Based on past dredging history and the geotechnical data in the area, it is the Districts opinion that materials to be dredged for this portion of the deepening project can be removed with a similarly configured dredge.  b.  Disposal of the majority of the dredged material will be into the Andrews Island upland containment area.  The pumping distance for this work will vary from 4,000 to 21,000 feet.  One open water disposal site will be use d to construct a bird island.  The bird island, a 16-acre site, will be constructed in the shallows of St. Simons Sound utilizing a portion of the material from the Jekyll Island and Cedar Hammock Ranges.  The pumping distance for this work will vary from 6,000 to 8,000 feet.  c.  The required dredging depth varies from minus 36 feet mllw to minus 41 feet mllw.  The portions of the channel to be dredged are Station 6+250 to Station 22+000, Stations 1+075 to 7+000 in South Brunswick River, and Stations 2+250  to 12+000 in East River.  2.  Would you bid on this project if it were advertised between 1 January 2004 and 1 Oct 2004?  3.  What size and type of dredging equipment would you use to perform the work?  4.  Would you more likely bid on this project if it were advertised between January 2004 and March 2004 or between July 2004 and September 2004?

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) Program Manager for Training Systems (PMTRASYS) and Training and Education Command (TECOM) are investigating technologies that will upgrade, enhance, or replace legacy components of the Indoor Simulated Marksmanship Training (ISMT) system.  The future training system will be required to provide Marines individual weapon skills training, collective skills (unit) training, indirect fire training, and decision-making training.  The training system will provide open flight combat environments shared among interconnected training systems interoperating through High Level Architecture (HLA) technologies.  The training system will immerse Marines in a tactical environment and allow for realistic training.  The system will be compatible with the following Marine Corps simulated weapons currently fielded: M9, M16A2, M203, M249, M240G, M2, MK19, M870, MP5, AT4, M153 SMAW, M224 60 mm mortar, 81 mm mortar, M4, M1014, and the Predator missile (new weapon).  The system will integrate the following new weapons: M18A1 Claymore Mine, M16A4, M40 Sniper Rifle with 10x Unertl Scope, AK47, and the RPG-7.  The system will be capable of training Marines on the following night vision devices: ANPVS 14 (replaces ANPVS 7B), PEQ 2A (replaces PAC 4C), PVS 17C (replaces Starlight Scope), ANPAS 13Bv2 (Medium Thermal Weapon Sight for M240G), ANPAS 13Bv3 (Heavy Thermal Weapon Sight for the M2 and the MK19), and the RCO / ACOGS (Rifle Combat Optics / Advance Combat Optical Gun Sight).  The training system will utilize commercial off-the shelf technologies when feasible, and integrate other desktop training tools such as Recognition of Combat Vehicles (ROC-V), Virtual Battle Station (VBS), Tactical Decision Making Simulation (TDMS), and Close Combat Marine.  The system will be deployable, easy to install, reconfigure, and operate.  The system will be installed on the LPD 17 ship.  The trainer will not adversely impact the manpower and force structure requirements of the Marine Corps.  The system will operate within the facility constraints of the current ISMT (15 ft wide, 30 ft long, 8 ft height, electrical power: 110v 15 amp 60 Hz, or for OCONUS 220v 10 amp 50 Hz). 

PMTRAYSYS and TECOM will host an information conference on 28 October 2003 at MCB Quantico, VA.  The purpose of this conference is for the Government to introduce the U.S. Marine Corps upcoming requirement and for Industry to provide information and the latest technology available.  To kick the conference off, PMTRASYS and TECOM will conduct a general information session from 0800-0830.  High-level Marine training requirements will be outlined during this presentation.  Following the Government’s presentation, interested vendors may deliver a 60-minute tabletop presentation to include any video clips, slides, or pictures of their training technology.  The following day, 29 October, vendors will be afforded an opportunity to conduct technology demonstrations.  

The conference will be held at the BOQ/BEQ Liversedge Hall: Phone: 703-784-3148.  Address: 15 Liversedge Drive, Marine Corps Base Quantico, VA 22134-5013 Web: http://www.quantico.usmc.mil/g4/bachelor/index.htm

Interested participants must respond no later than COB 17 October 2003 with intent to attend the information conference in order to formulate the presentation schedule.  The Government will not fund any contractor costs or expenses associated with attendance at the ISMT RFI including labor, travel, briefing, and demonstrating technology.  Attendance at the RFI is voluntary.  The Government will not endorse a vendor or product based on attendance at the RFI.  Marine Requirement, Acquisition, and Subject Matter Expert (SME) personnel will attend the conference. 

The Government intends to release a request for proposals (RFP) for a competitive firm-fixed price contract in October 2004.  Anyone interested in attending the conference shall submit a request NLT to either Mr. Fred Boehne, email fred.Boehne@navy.mil or Capt Billy Mills, email: william.mills@navy.mil (TELEPHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED).  Only those companies requesting to attend will receive additional information on this conference.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Interest
<DESC>Solicitation Number:  TBD Title:  Notice of Interest Proposal Disallowed Reason: This Notice of Interest concerning the release of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to solicit research and development (R&D) is issued in accordance with 10 CFR 600 and 48 CFR Part 35.016.  Proposers should not submit a proposal in response to this Notice of Interest, but may submit a proposal after release of a solicitation at a later date. Description: The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) will be jointly soliciting proposals for R&D to improve national capabilities to detect, locate, and identify nuclear explosions. It is anticipated that this solicitation will be released on or about November 03, 2003 seeking proposals with a period of performance of 1-3 years. The objective of the solicitation will be to advance the state-of-the-art in seismic, hydroacoustic and infrasound methods of nuclear explosion monitoring. This will be achieved through basic and applied research that enhances understanding of the underlying phenomena, proposes new methods of tackling monitoring problems, or develops new data of use in nuclear explosion monitoring.  Where appropriate, priority will be given to studies of propagation conditions in Eurasia. Research products developed under this solicitation shall support Air Force requirements for improving the nation?s capabilities to monitor nuclear explosions. Information about the NNSA Nuclear Explosion Monitoring Research & Engineering (NEM R&E) program integration of research products into operational form for the Air Force can be found online at https://www.nemre.nnsa.doe.gov/nemre/KnowledgeBase. Research is being sought in five topic areas: TOPIC 1: Energy partition and propagation for local and regional seismic phases including effects on magnitudes and effects of source physics; TOPIC 2: Calibration and Ground Truth Collection; TOPIC 3: Seismic Detection, Location and Discrimination; TOPIC 4: Infrasound; and TOPIC 5: Hydroacoustic studies. Topic 1 (Energy partition and propagation for local and regional seismic phases including effects on magnitudes and effects of source physics) Proposals are sought complementing existing efforts to answer the question of how seismic energy is generated from underground phenomena (including distributed and single point explosions, double-couple earthquakes and other modes of rock failure), how this energy is partitioned between P and S waves, and how it propagates to regional distances (less than 2,000 km). Generation of S waves from explosions is of particular interest, as are models of the source, both theoretical and empirical.  Theoretical and empirical models should address the generation and partitioning of the seismic energy and the effect of properties such as 1) source region medium and overburden, 2) the local structure, and 3) the surrounding tectonic province is also of interest. Also of interest are the possible effects of frozen hard rock on explosive coupling. In propagation, the influence of 3D laterally varying structure, including laterally varying vertical velocity gradients, and 3D scattering on the stability of propagation of Pn, Pg, Sn, Lg is of interest.  Another question is: what is the physical basis for a measurable property, such as magnitude that can be directly related to the yield of a fully coupled explosion, and how do emplacement conditions affect the observation? Proposals for field experiments, theoretical investigations, and observational investigations including empirical source models and mine investigations will be accepted under this topic. In addition, proposals for improved modeling of waveforms at local, regional, and near-teleseismic distances will be considered. Topic 2 (Seismic Calibration and Ground Truth Collection) Proposals for dedicated GT0 calibration explosions are of high interest, especially reciprocal calibration shots.  Collection of ground truth at a GT5 level or better is sought for events of magnitude 2.5 and larger.  Such high-quality ground truth events (with absolute location and depth errors less than 5 kilometers) might be obtained from: a) dense local networks, b) instrumented mines, c) remote sensing, d) other techniques.  Special consideration will be given to remote sensing techniques for ground truth collection applicable to regions that are difficult or impossible to access. Proposals that specifically address uncertainties in the acquired ground truth information are desirable.  Geophysical studies that generate new ground-truth events with source geometry information are sought, such as mining explosions or mining-related collapse studies. Proposals are sought to develop models that calibrate earth velocity and attenuation structure, especially in aseismic regions.  Priority will be given to studies of propagation conditions in Eurasia.  Improved Q models with emphasis on regional phases Pn, Pg, Sn, Lg and surface waves are desirable. Particular emphasis will be placed on procedures that develop models by fitting multiple datasets (e.g. body and surface wave tomography, receiver functions, refraction data, gravity, etc.), and procedures that estimate the uncertainty of geophysical models.  Proposals are also sought that characterize transition zone propagation, i.e. mapping and calibrating travel time and amplitude behavior of P and S waves traveling through the transition zone (ray bottoming depths from the Moho to 660 km, and distance ranges from 13 to 30 degrees). Topic 3 (Seismic Detection, Location, and Discrimination) Seismic signal processing methods are sought with potential to significantly lower the thresholds at which detection, location and identification functions can be performed at acceptable false alarm rates.  In particular, new methods of array signal processing are solicited that employ calibration or other techniques to enhance signal detection and parameter estimation (e.g. azimuth, phase velocity) in strongly heterogeneous media. Full waveform synthetic seismogram matching to data for seismic event detection, location, and discrimination are also of interest. Estimating improvements in detection, including testing of detection processes using superposition of actual signals in increasing noise, is of interest. Improved methods of arrival-time picking and phase identification, especially for local (0-300 km) and far-regional (1500 km and greater) phases are desired. Improved location techniques are sought, especially development of mathematical and geophysical techniques for determining new ground-truth events and earth structure.  An example could be combining relative event locations with limited ground-truth constraints (such as fault planes). Proposals for advanced discrimination methods that make significant improvement over current techniques would be of interest, as are new techniques of detecting and validating depth phases for crustal events observed locally, regionally and teleseismically.  Proposals to extend existing techniques of discrimination such as Ms:mb to lower level regional signals are of particular interest. Topic 4 (Infrasound) In determining seismic ground truth, proposals are sought for an improved understanding of the fundamental physics of local and regional propagation of infrasound signals from underground contained and near-surface explosions, characterizing the variety of infrasonic noise environments, and improving the understanding of atmosphere dynamics affecting propagation of infrasound acoustic waves. Proposals are also sought that advance understanding of the fundamental physics of the propagation of long-range infrasound signals.   A better understanding of sources, noise and the temporal atmospheric conditions that affect propagation of infrasound acoustic waves is needed. Improved ground-truth infrasound databases to better understand infrasound observations are also needed.  Focused investigations and/or field experiments using man-made sources and natural phenomenon will be considered.

<SUBJECT>10 -- REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/INITIAL DELIVERY VEHICLE CONCEPT CALL FOR THE NEXT GENERATION LAND BASED STRATEGIC DETERRENT (LBSD) ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES (AoA)
<DESC>Land Based Strategic Deterrent (LBSD) Delivery Vehicle Request for Information (RFI).  Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) is investigating potential concepts to support the LBSD Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Study for the next generation deterrent system.  This RFI initiates a concept call for transformational delivery vehicles meeting the Land Based Strategic Nuclear Deterrent Mission Need Statement (MNS) and LBSD Concept of Operations (CONOPS).  In addition, the AoA will study each concept’s potential as a multiple-use platform; that is, how it might satisfy, or partially satisfy, other AFSPC mission needs such as Prompt Global Strike and Operationally Responsive Spacelift.  Concepts should address enhanced performance, decreased manpower and reduced maintenance and operations footprint.  Commensurate with this concept call, this RFI requests an assessment of the feasibility, technical maturity and growth potential of the enabling technologies for each concept.  This is one of multiple RFIs that will address the entire next generation deterrent system.  The Air Force (AF) anticipates a future competitive evolutionary acquisition program starting in 2005 or 2006 to begin replacing the existing system in 2018. 

This RFI includes the following sub-system areas:  propulsion, guidance, re-entry systems and re-entry vehicles.  The next generation deterrent system may be based in existing Minuteman III (MM III) silos, with significantly updated supporting infrastructure, where necessary.  The system may also use innovative deployment and basing strategies in addition to or in place of existing MM III silos, including but not limited to: mobile basing, fixed basing with mobile elements, new silo schema, etc.  Operations, maintenance and logistics concepts should be addressed.  A description of how this concept fits into the overarching weapon system infrastructure may also be addressed. Proposed infrastructure should comply with the DoD Joint Technical Architecture requirements, interoperability and survivability standards.  All concepts should address applicability of the AF Enterprise Architecture Framework.  

AFSPC is soliciting concepts from Industry, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, AF Labs and Product Centers.  The AoA study may construct Government alternatives from concepts submitted in response to this RFI.    Alternatives will be evaluated based on cost and effectiveness. Effectiveness is assessed against the Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) and Measures of Performance (MOPs) in the AoA Study Plan.  Results of the AoA will be provided to key decision makers in anticipation of a future acquisition, but the government does not anticipate releasing the results.  

Interested parties should visit the LBSD website at www.hill.af.mil/icbm/lm4 to register and obtain additional information.  The website contains the MNS, MOEs and MOPs, unclassified background information, desired system characteristics, acronyms, list of registered interested parties, industry day information as well as other information related to this effort.  Access to classified weapon system information and Department of Defense Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information will only be available to registered parties with appropriate security clearances on site at the ICBM SPO at Hill AFB, UT.  

RFI submissions should include:  1) A concept overview with description, diagrams, and interfaces; 2) Capabilities of the concept, mapped to the key attributes and the enabling technology with associated maturity needed to implement; 3) To the extent possible, life cycle costs/schedule associated with RDT&E, Procurement, Sustainment and Disposal; 4)  Key performance characteristics to enable effective modeling and assessment; 5)  Additional information or recommendations.  Respondents are required to submit concepts via the format found at the website.  Please limit company overviews associated with the submissions to two (2) pages.  Classified information up to Top Secret may be submitted in separate appendices and marked accordingly.  Total submissions should not exceed 50 pages for each concept.  Provide five hard copies and four electronic copies (on compact discs).  The evaluation team will use Microsoft Office 2000 or Adobe Acrobat Reader for evaluating electronic submissions.  Proprietary RFI submissions will be protected consistent with markings.  Responses are due by 5:00 p.m. Mountain Standard Time, 21 November 2003. 

The Government anticipates an AoA Industry Day (ID) prior to submittal of the concepts.  This ID will further describe the Government’s AoA activities and vision for the future, and provide the opportunity for questions and answers.  Details for this ID will be provided at the website.  Questions may be addressed via the website.  After the submission of the concepts, additional opportunities for questions/answers with registered individual respondents are anticipated. 

THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.  This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this contemplated effort.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government’s use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor’s input resulting from this RFI.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI may be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the AoA.  The information provided may be utilized by the AF in developing its acquisition strategy and in its Statement of Objective and Performance Specifications.  The information resulting from this RFI may be included/combined with other submissions in one or more alternatives considered in the AoA study.  Any proprietary information that is submitted may be used in establishing requirements of the future system but specific information will be safeguarded as proprietary.   

Please note:  Submissions may be viewed by non-Government personnel.  Under separate action the AF may contract to provide services such as technical, evaluation, and acquisition management support.  Any such service contracts will contain an organizational conflict of interest clause that requires service contractors to protect the data and prohibits the service contractors from using the data for any purpose other than that for which the data was presented.  Such contractor(s) may be precluded from proposing on LBSD.

<SUBJECT>10 -- REQUEST FOR INFORMATION /INITIAL SECURITY SYSTEM CONCEPT CALL FOR THE NEXT GENERATION LAND BASED STRATEGIC DETERRENT (LBSD) ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES (AoA)
<DESC>Land Based Strategic Deterrent (LBSD) Security System Request for Information (RFI).  Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) is investigating potential concepts to support the LBSD Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Study for the next generation deterrent system.  This RFI initiates a concept call for transformational Security technologies meeting the Land Based Strategic Nuclear Deterrent Mission Need Statement (MNS) and LBSD Concept of Operations (CONOPS).  Concepts should address enhanced performance, decreased manpower and reduced maintenance and operations footprint, and should be consistent with the Air Force’s force protection doctrine and integrated base defense concept.  Commensurate with this concept call, this RFI requests an assessment of the feasibility, technical maturity and growth potential of the enabling technologies for each concept.  This is one of multiple RFIs that will address the entire next generation deterrent system.  The Air Force (AF) anticipates a future competitive evolutionary acquisition program starting in 2005 or 2006 to begin replacing the existing system in 2018. 

This RFI includes Security Systems associated with the following areas:  primary launch center; launcher location; command, control, communications and computer systems; and transportation of the weapon system or any of its critical components.  The next generation deterrent system may be based in existing Minuteman III (MM III) silos, with significantly updated supporting infrastructure, where necessary.  The system may also use innovative deployment and basing strategies in addition to or in place of existing MM III silos, including but not limited to: mobile basing, fixed basing with mobile elements, new silo schema, etc.  Operations, maintenance and logistics concepts should be discussed.  A description of how this concept fits into the overarching weapon system infrastructure may also be addressed. 

The Analysis of Alternatives will consider multiple uses for the LBSD concepts (e.g., nuclear, conventional, spacelift) that will require a security concept or concepts appropriate to a conventional system (protection level one and/or two), a nuclear system, or a security concept potentially scalable from conventional to nuclear requirements.
The security system concept should be developed around the objective of ensuring 100% positive access control by preventing access to any LBSD component or system through an integrated, robust, systematic blending of physical/structural barriers, point access control systems, electronic intrusion detection and assessment, and response and security forces training, tactics and procedures (TTPs).  Security afforded the LBSD must comply with applicable DoD and AF nuclear security standards, and appropriate protection levels in a conventional mode.  Consideration should be given to the use of deceive, deter, delay, deny, anticipate, respond, mitigate and neutralize measures to protect the weapon system.  This may be a combination of security protective technology, physical security basing features, and lethal and non-lethal denial systems.
Transportation vehicle and launcher location should provide physical access delay time sufficient to prevent a knowledgeable, determined, capable threat from gaining access before responsive forces arrive.  If access is gained, facility interiors should contain elements to deny threat agents the ability to gain control of a weapon system resource.  Security systems must be designed and hardened to provide significant delay against modern thermal, mechanical, and explosive breaching techniques to preclude weapon access, theft, deliberate unauthorized use or unauthorized launch.  Threat detection/assessment should use the latest technologies in the continuum of intelligence gathering, monitoring avenues of approach outside facility/vehicle demarcations, facility electronic intrusion detection and immediate visual assessment of intrusion alarms (including remote assessment).  Ideally, monitored areas will effectively provide an expanded clear zone around resource locations to provide for early detection of potential threats.  Proposed infrastructure should comply with the DoD Joint Technical Architecture requirements, interoperability and survivability standards.  All concepts should address applicability of the AF Enterprise Architecture Framework.
 
AFSPC is soliciting Concepts from Industry, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, AF Labs and Product Centers.
