TEAM BACKGROUND The Manufacturing Engineering Division (MED) at the NASA Glenn Research Center works with scientists and engineers to develop innovative manufacturing approaches for prototype research and test articles in support of the Center’s research and technology programs. The current Manufacturing Engineering Division is organized into four branches with a total Civil Service workforce of 100 civil servants.  Of the current workforce 8 percent are African American males, 9 percent are females, with the remaining 83 percent being white males. The past culture of the Division was a white male dominated organization made up primarily of war veterans.  At its highest peak of civil servants, the Division consisted of 259 civil servants.  African American males and women broke into the workforce during the late 1970’s.  The culture at then Lewis Research Centers was also white dominated with a “Good Ole Boy” type mentality loaded with a plethora of “isms”. This culture, although not as profound, is still in existence.  Some of the objective outcome of this training is to circumvent the “isms” that still exist in the Division.  III.	TRAINING AND/OR INTERVENTION GOALS The training for managers is to focus on the following areas:   Performance management; 2) conduct and discipline; 3) developing performance plans with non-supervisory employees; and 4) managing diverse teams to enhance teambuilding and trust.  The training for employees (non-supervisory employees) is to focus on: 1) performance management; 2) conduct and discipline; 3) career development and performance planning; and 4) working in a diverse team with a high-level of trust. The following outcomes for management training for completion of work under this contract are: -To understand what performance management is -To implement a valid performance management system  -To develop valid performance plans -To assist employees to increase their performance from acceptable    to exceeds expectations -To understand their responsibilities for conduct and discipline -To identify and address conduct issues and problems -To facilitate teambuilding in a diverse culture -To facilitate building trust among employees and with management   in the division The following outcomes for employees (non-supervisory training) for completion of work under this contract are: -To understand their responsibilities based on their position descriptions -To understand their rights and responsibilities for appropriate conduct in the workplace -To understand their responsibility and involvement in their own career development  -To work more effectively with diverse co-workers -To identify their own attitudes and values and become aware of how these impact on one’s behavior in the workplace -To develop an awareness and respect for the diverse workforce (race, gender, age, education, experience, status, etc.) IV.    PARTICIPANTS AND COURSE DATES The estimated number of supervisory and managerial employees attending the training is 110.  Specific dates have not been scheduled; however, the courses should be offered in the March 2002 through May 2002 timeframe.  The vendor’s availability and mutually agreeable dates to schedule the session by GRC’s Organization Development and Training Office and the Manufacturing Engineering Division can determine the dates.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) anticipates award of a Firm-Fixed Price Design/Build contract with award fees for the design and construction of a high security United States Penitentiary (USP) and Federal Prison Camp (FPC) to be located near Tucson, Arizona.  The scope of work includes all architectural, engineering, construction, and other related services necessary to provide the new federal correctional facility.  The proposed high security USP and FPC is currently planned to consist of a group of buildings in a ?campus plan? arrangement with related site development and site utilities.  The high security facility and camp will have a gross building area of approximately 62,000 square meters and be designed to house approximately 1,100 inmates.  The anticipated performance period of this project is approximately 945 consecutive calendar days after notice to proceed is issued.  The estimated magnitude of this project is expected to exceed $75,000,000.  For consideration on this project, the offeror at a minimum must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, in successfully and satisfactorily completing a project of similar size and scope.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.  For the design member of the design-build team, the Architect/Engineer firm or the principal or lead A/E firm of a joint venture must have an existing active office, which will have responsibility for the plans and specifications, located within the State of Arizona.  The design of the architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, or other engineering features of the project shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by architects and engineers registered in the State of Arizona to practice in the particular professional field involved.  Participation by architects, engineers, consultants, and subcontractors located within the State of Arizona is encouraged.  Participation by small, small-disadvantaged, HUBZone small businesses, small woman-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses.   The successful offeror will be required to submit a subcontracting plan for this procurement regarding the utilization of small, small-disadvantaged, small woman-owned businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  The FBOP will be utilizing two-phase Design-Build selection procedures.  The Phase One solicitation will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration?s Federal Business Opportunities web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Hard copies of the Phase One solicitation document will not be available.  The web site provides downloading instructions.  All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this web site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the web site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition.  This notice is not a request for proposals.  Phase One solicitations will be issued on or about January 7, 2002.  The Phase One proposal due date will be identified in the Phase One solicitation.  The Phase One solicitation will provide the scope of work, evaluation factors (Past Performance, Capability to Perform, Specialized Experience and Technical Competence, and Technical Approach) and submission information for interested Design-Build firms to prepare their Phase One qualification proposals.  Phase One qualification proposals  will be evaluated to determine which firms will be selected as offerors for Phase Two.  Phase Two participants will submit competitive past performance, technical, small business and price proposals as defined in the Phase Two solicitation.  The Phase Two evaluation factors (Past Performance, Preliminary Design and Proposed Technical Solutions, Proposed Organization and Key Personnel Consultants and Subcontractors, Management Approach, Small Business Subcontracting, Project Schedule Development and Monitoring, and Construction Quality Control and Assurance) are significantly more important than price, however, as proposals become more equal, price becomes more important and may be a determining factor for award.

Williams, Contracting Officer, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Construction Contracting Section, 320 First Street, NW, 500-6, Washington, DC 20534.

The potential Prime contractor will be required to continue with the development of the JPALS LDGPS technical architecture and the reduction of key military LDGPS technical risks.  The specific objectives of the CAD phase of the JPALS program are: (1) Using the functional allocation produced during the Concept Exploration (CE) phase of JPALS as a starting point, further define the functions, interfaces, and allocations needed to satisfy the performance requirements identified in the JPALS System Requirements Document (SRD). (2) Using the physical architecture produced during the CE phase of JPALS as a starting point, develop a JPALS Tactical physical architecture to include analyzing and modeling of differential correction and navigation processing algorithms, integrity and protection level algorithm development, inertial aiding architecture analysis, analyze and quantify the effects of anti-jam technologies on JPALS guidance quality performance, and conduct an integrated architecture analysis that examines the relationship between system architecture variations, operational environments and system performance.  (3) Provide characterization data of evolving GPS receivers and anti-jam technologies to support a Government study and provide GPS receivers or anti-jam technologies for Government testing.  4) Provide detailed documentation of the modeling and simulation (M&S) tools used to generate architecture recommendations, support Government validation of these tools, and support the Government in development of an independent M&S capability.  (5) Identify and evaluate ground multipath mitigation techniques that could be used by the JPALS ground station and potentially demonstrate these techniques.  (6) Perform or support the testing of contractor or Government equipment or software, to include test planning, integration, operation, data collection and analysis, and reporting of results.

<DESC>The government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures. NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for analysis of a government provided ERBS Spacecraft recommendations for configuration changes or operational strategies which promote the spacecraft's health and safety and/or success of the mission; spacecraft documentation drawings, test data, etc; computer modeling of spacecraft subsystem performance; support of key meetings; e.g. space environment affecting mission support-leonids, solar activity, etc. Flight S/W changes affecting performance and items within this task statement support of important operational events, anomalies, incidents, ad-hoc investigations/concerns; support of any planned engineering tests or simulations. Deliverables: presentations, engineering reports, trending and analysis, statement/position recommendations reports, etc; as required by the mission director/task manager. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from  Ball Aerospace in Boulder, Co., because they designed, fabricated, integrated, tested and delivered the ERBS Spacecraft to GSFC. They are the only source of technical information regarding the ERBS design and the only company capable of providing the engineering support, simulations, and command loads required by this purchase for dealing with anomalies on the spacecraft and planning the final instrument calibrations and decommissioning activities. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on  2/26/02.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not  acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the purchase of Hyper Algorithmic Logic HAL as follows:  1 each, HAL-15 hardware; 1 each VIVA Icon based software upgrades; 1 each hardware and software support. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Bridge Systems, Inc., as the only known source which can meet agency needs. Under a Space Act Agreement, NASA Langley Research Center has evaluated the HAL (Hyper Algorithmic Logic)-15 Hypercomputer from Star Bridge Systems, Inc., of Midvale, Utah.  The HAL-15 is the first of a new breed of high performance computer that replaces the traditional central processing units with faster Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  These are specialty chips on a circuit board that can reconfigure themselves hundreds or thousands of times a second.  This makes them 1000 times faster than traditional commercial CPUs.  This maximizes the use of millions of transistors (gates) on each silicon array.  HAL is programmed graphically using the company's proprietary programming language, VIVA.  This language facilitates rapid custom software development by the system's users.  NASA LaRC will purchase HAL to continue to explore:  Solutions for structural, electromagnetic and fluid analysis; Radiation analysis for astronaut safety; Atmospheric science analysis; Digital signal processing; Pattern recognition; Acoustic analysis. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 12, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:
1 YEAR FROM DATE OF CONTRACT AWARD

TITLE:
Consulting Services for DCP Recruitment Project

The Agency Human Services Service, Division of Commissioned Personnel through the Program Support Center, General
Acquisitions Branch, plans to award a one year sole source simplified acquisition to the Commissioned Officer
Foundation, 560 8201 Corporate Drive Landover, MD 20785.  The anticipated date of award is February 20, 2002.

This contract proposal is intended to assist in addressing the problems of recruitment of PHS Commissioned Officers at the various agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and at other Federal Agencies with
health missions using these officers.

The contract involves a professional review and assessment of Commissioned Officer recruitment and retention material
developed by the Division of Commissioned Personnel of the PHS as well as by the various operating units within the DHHS and by related Federal agencies.  It specifically addresses recruitment at a "decision critical" time in the professional life of the health professional, namely during his or her matriculation through one of the schools of health professions.  It will also
include among other assessment factors, a determination of those personal elements which influence recruitment and are linked
to a well recognized desire of health professionals to be associated with a group which has, is and will in the future
provide an opportunity for a team oriented approach to the advancement of public health.

The contract shall be carried out by the PHS Commissioned Officers Foundation working in consort with private organizations with an expertise and interest in health manpower development such as the Public Health Foundation, the Association of State and Territorial
Health Officers, the Association of State and Territorial Laboratory Directors, the Association of Schools of Public Health,
the International and American Association for Dental Research, the American Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties, the American
Association of Medical Colleges, The Commissioned Officers Association of the PHS and the American Public Health
Association.

DCP is looking to acquire technical consulting services to provide advice, guidance, knowledge of Commissioned Corps recruitment materials, and recommendations targeted to schools of health professions to evaluate knowledge and disposition of faculty and students about the PHS Commissioned Corps.  Consultant services

Description of Work. The contractor shall plant 112,617 sagebrush seedlings within specific upland shrub-steppe habitat restoration sites at the Yakima Training Center (YTC), Yakima, Washington.  A map will be provided upon request.  The contractor shall p lant the shrubs by hand using any of several means available (i.e., hoe-dads, shovels, planting bars, etc.) to properly place, space, and compact soil around each shrub as specified.  Notice to proceed with the work shall be based upon sufficient soil mois ture, and will be determined by YTC personnel. The planting shall be accomplished in such manner as to provide the shrubs the best opportunity for survival (i.e., full soil to root contact, proper planting hole depth and placement to prevent J-ing of roots , etc.).  The seedlings will be rather large and in variable sizes.  Shrubs will have rootlengths of 8- 12 inches, tops of 10 inches or more, and stem calipers of ¼ - ½ in.  Shrubs will be provided in boxes containing from 186-400 plants per box depending on size.  Shrubs shall remain in cold storage until the day they are planted to maintain dormancy.  Any plants left over each day will be returned to cold storage. The contractor shall plant the shrubs in several patterns as determined and directed by YTC personnel.  Spacing of the plants shall be on 6-foot centers and planted in rows, islands, patches, tria ds or crescents. YTC personnel will identify specific sites and planting patterns to be used.  The goal of this effort is to re-establish a mosaic of shrub colonies that can provide natural regeneration of larger areas, and to provide specific habitat requ irements within these areas.  Government use of  facilities is anticipated while the work is being performed.  The work shall be planned and accomplished, so that there will be a minimum of interference and inconvenience to occupants and agencies in the vi cinity, and to other individuals who may be working at these facilities.  The contractor shall coordinate with YTC Operations Center to determine when training events are scheduled in areas affected by this project and plan planting efforts around this tra ining schedule.  All operations performed by the contractor shall be conducted in compliance with all required Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.  The contractor shall be responsible for disposal of all waste products generated during the perf ormance of this contract.  All packing materials shall be disposed of at the YTC garbage transfer station.  All other waste materials shall be disposed of by the contractor at an off-post location.  The contractor shall utilize existing roads and trails to  access planting areas, and shall utilize existing staging areas in the fields.  Siber Stake areas are off limits to vehicle traffic.  These sites are clearly marked and are readily identifiable.  The timing of this shrub planting project shall tentatively  be between 15 February and 30 March 2002. Upon issue of notice to proceed, the contractor shall have three days to mobilize and begin planting the shrubs. The contractor shall complete planting within 14 calendar days after given the notice to proceed.  T his narrow window of performance is required to take advantage of optimum soil moisture opportunities and to ensure that shrubs retain their integrity.  It is anticipated that the contractor will have to plant 8,044 shrubs per day to meet the proposed perf ormance standard.  The contractor must consider the appropriate labor requirements to meet the 14-day performance window.  Contractor personnel shall be experienced and qualified in this type of work.  The Government will provide maps of the areas to be pl anted, marking/flagging of areas to be planted, sagebrush seedlings to be planted, and coordination with military elements at the YTC.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement and wishing to be considered, must submit one copy each of SF 254 and SF 255 for the firm or joint venture and SF 254 for each subcontractor.

The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be regis tered in the CCR before receiving a contract from any activity of the Department of Defense.  The rule authorizes contracting officers to reject offers from contractors that have not registered.  (The CCR's web site may be accessed at http://www.acq.osd.mi l/ec.)  Small and small disadvantaged business firms are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small busines ses.  All interested firms are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent with small and small disadvantaged firms in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507.  If a large business firm is selected for this contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.  Of those dollars the large business firm intends to subcontract out, the Cor ps of Engineers floors for subcontracting are 61.4% to small business concerns; 9.1% to SBA Certified Small Disadvantaged Business concerns; 5.0% to women-owned small business concerns; 2.5% for SBA Certified HUBZone concerns and 3.0% for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business.  The term 'floors' is used instead of 'goals' as the Corps of Engineers objective is to exceed the percentages rather than merely meet the percentages.  Large firms should keep these floors in mind when considering qualificati ons of potential subcontractors and ensure that each proposed subcontractor's socio-economic status is clearly identified in the submission of qualifications.  An approved small business-subcontracting plan will be required prior to award.  The NAIC code i s 541330. The size standard is $4,000,000.  Your attention is directed to FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, which will be included in the contract set-aside for small business and which states in part: 'At least 50 percent of the cost of contra ct performance incurred for personnel shall be expended or employees of the concern'.

The required forms shall be submitted to the following add ress: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN: CESAJ-EN-T, 400 West Bay Street, Room 565, Jacksonville, FL 32202-4412 or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN: CESAJ-EN-T, P.O. Box 4970, Jacksonville, FL 32232-0019.  This is not a request for proposal.

<DESC>The William J. Hughes Technical Center, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ proposes to award a cost plus fixed fee – completion contract to the Raytheon Technical Services Company (RTSC) located in Indianapolis, IN for characterization of wire degradation.   The contract will constitute Phases II and III of a 3- phase project that was initiated under an interagency agreement between the FAA and the Navy.  RTSC has been selected because their lab has the capability to perform virtually every test required by the wiring Quality Product List (QPL) program.  Because of the sensitivity of research project, it is considered essential that an independent lab perform this tasking.  This precludes wire suppliers and aircraft manufacturers.  RTSC is an independent lab capable of performing the tasks and transitioning the Phase I data into Phases II and III. <P>

<DESC>THIS PRE-SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED FOR ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF UP TO FIVE INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS.  TWO OF THE CONTRACTS ARE INTENDED TO BE SET ASIDE FOR 8(A) FIRMS, AND THE OTHER THREE ARE INTENDED TO BE UNRESTRICTED.  This SIC Code for this Solicitation is 23332: Commercial & Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $27,500,000.  The scope of work for this contract will primarily be new construction, roofing, demolition, routine renovation and repair of facilities and infrastructure including: 1) aviation and aircraft facilities, 2) marine facilities, 3) barracks and personnel housing facilities, 4) administrative facilities, 5) warehouses and supply facilities, 6) abatement and handling of hazardous/regulated materials (including and not limited to asbestos, lead paint and PCBs), for the Area of Responsibility (AOR) of ROICC Key West, FL.  Each contract will be for one base year with three one-year options.  The total 4 year (base year and 3 option years) estimated construction costs for all of the IDIQ contracts is NTE $30,000,000.  Construction schedules will be determined for each project at the issuance of each task order.  The anticipated construction cost for each task order is between $100,000 and $3,000,000. NOTE:  No design build Task Orders  $1,000,000 or over will be issued under these contracts until after 25 June 2003. The only Task Orders to be issued up to 25 June 2003 will be 100% Plans and Specs, Task Orders where the scope is developed by on-site visits and design build projects less than $1,000,000.   The Government will award up to five contracts resulting from this solicitation to the five responsible proposers whose proposals conforming to the solicitations will be ?BEST VALUE? to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  This procurement will consist of Two (2) Phases.  Phase I:  Phase I of the procurement will result in a narrowing of Offerors? to a maximum of seven (7) firms based on Phase I evaluation factors that include FACTOR A: Past Performance, (1) Design Team, (2) Construction Team; FACTOR B: Small Business Subcontracting Effort, FACTOR C:  Technical Qualifications, (1) Design Team and FACTOR D: Management Approach.  A maximum of seven (7) firms will be selected to submit Technical and Price proposals in Phase II.  Phase II Qualified Proposers will be evaluated on: FACTOR A: Past Performance (same as Phase I unless conditions change); FACTOR B: Small Business Subcontracting Effort, FACTOR C: Technical qualification (Construction Team) (same as Phase I unless conditions change); and FACTOR D:  Technical Solutions.  Proposers in Phase II will also be evaluated on two seed projects: (1) Roof Replacement of A-1004 Telecommunications Building, NAS, Key West, FL and (2) C-1 Renovate and Relocate Sigsbee and Truman PW Shops, Key West, FL.  Offerors proceeding to Phase II will be required to submit technical and price proposals for each seed project.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals in Phase II for both seed projects will not be considered for an award.  The Government reserves the right to award the two seed projects separately to two offerors or combined to one offeror.  The Government will award seed projects based on the most advantageous combination of price and technical factors that result in the overall best value award to the Government.  The award of a funded seed project satisfied the requirement of a greater than nominal quantity for contract award.  A minimum guarantee of $50,000 will be consideration fro the award of the IDIQ contract(s0 without a seed project.  The minimum guarantee can be met with one or more task orders over the four year contract term for those offeror(s) who were not awarded seed project(s).  If discussions are required, they will be conducted with each offeror in the competitive range.   After award of the initial contracts, successful contractors will compete for task orders based on either best value using the trade off process or low price technically acceptable to the Government.  Construction schedules will be determined fro each project at the issuance of each task order.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all proposers; to award the contract to other than the proposers submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the proposer submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government.  Proposers are advised that the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions or any contact concerning the proposals received.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.  Proposers should not assume they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation.  The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 6 February 2002.  Phase II will be issued at a later date.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The estimated magnitude of this project is expected to exceed $75,000,000.  For consideration on this project, the offeror at a minimum must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, in successfully and satisfactorily completing a project of similar size and scope.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.  For the design member of the design-build team, the Architect/Engineer firm or the principal or lead A/E firm of a joint venture must have an existing active office, which will have responsibility for the plans and specifications, located within the State of Arizona.  The design of the architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, or other engineering features of the project shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by architects and engineers registered in the State of Arizona to practice in the particular professional field involved.  Participation by architects, engineers, consultants, and subcontractors located within the State of Arizona is encouraged.

<DESC>NA Anniston Army Depot is seeking qualified candidates to study predicted versus actual noise induced hearing loss on a population intermittently exposed to noise in an industrial environment.  The population in question is not considered at risk by a conserv ative application of the OSHA standard (Table G-16a), but is considered at risk under the more stringent monitoring model ascribed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists and Army method of Technical Guide 181 (TG 181).  The purpos e of the study is to determine which method of dosimetry is the best predictor of risk and more specifically to compare the degree of hearing loss in this population with that of an appropriate control group in order to determine their risk of occupational ly induced hearing impairment.  The study group consists of 500 to 700 employees for comparative analysis of  actual versus predicted hearing loss.  Fifteen to twenty years of employment histories, audiometric data, and noise dosimetry are available for th e study group.  There are also three years of dual dosimetry (3 and 5 dB Exchange Rates) records for the study group.  The primary investigator must  be either a board certified Occupational and Environmental Medicine physician  or have a PhD equivalent in  Epidemiology, Industrial Hygiene, or Audiology. A PhD Audiologist with experience in hearing loss and noise measurement assessments from industrial environments with intermittent noise must be involved in the protocol development and in the data review. The completed study document must be able to pass peer review and be publishable in scientific literature.  Study must be concluded within a year of the commencement date.  The study must be conducted with oversight from an appropriate Institutional Review  Board.  Interested candidates are requested to provide literature regarding their organization and capabilities, available resources, and credentials not later than 7 days after synopsis appears in the CBD.  Information must be submitted electronically. Information may be faxed to 256-235-4618 or sent to Rita Dingler at dinglerr@anad.amry.mil.  This is a sources sought – do not request solicitation.

<SUBJECT>56 -- Request for Information for Blast and Shatter-Resistant Window Film
<DESC>This Request for Information is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute an Invitation for Bids or Request for Proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to either procure any services or pay for the information received.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 235990, and the definition of a small business for this acquisition is a firm that has had $11.5 million or less in average annual receipts over the company's prior three fiscal years.  Within the Facilities Services Division of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), a team has been established to evaluate means of protecting OPM's employees from the effects of blasts or explosions near its headquarters building in Washington, DC.  This review will include, but will not be limited to, blast and shatter-resistant (BSR) window film for possible use by OPM in its headquarters building in Washington, DC as an anti-terrorism measure.  This team recognizes the importance of industry involvement in such research and offers the following questions to interested industry partners to further the team's discussions.  1. Through what methods, including BSR window film, are building occupants currently protected from the effects of blast or explosion near their building?  2. What methods are most often used to install these types of protection, including the installation of BSR window film on windows in large buildings with several thousand windows?  3. How large a sheet of glass can be made blast or shatter-resistant by such window film or by any other method of protecting building occupants?  4. Have any new approaches been developed since the Oklahoma City bombing or since the bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.  5. Is it normally recommended to protect all floors of a building or only floors up to a certain height?  How is this determination made?  6. How much, if any, construction or reinforcement of existing window glass or frames is required by each method?  7. How is price calculated?  Please be detailed and specific.  8. How is the protection afforded by these methods measured?  Is there an industry-wide standard for various types of buildings?  9. What is the usual lead-time to begin a project to protect building occupants in a large office building?  What factors affect this?  Please be detailed and specific.  All interested parties are encouraged to respond to these questions in writing via fax at 202-606-1508 or by e-mail to either Mr. Ronald Peacock at rapeacock@opm.gov or Mr. James S. Conners at jsconner@opm.gov by February 21, 2002.  Vendors may visit OPM's headquarters building at 1900 E Street, NW, Washington, DC and receive a facility tour to better understand the building's characteristics and its location between the U.S. Department of State headquarters building and the White House.  If you have questions or wish to schedule a tour, please call Mr. Peacock at 202-606-2220.
