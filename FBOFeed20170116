<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (DOC/NOAA/NESDIS), intends to award a Purchase Order pursuant to Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the authority of FAR Pat 13.    This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format at FAR Subpart 12.6., as supplemented with additional information included in this notice, and it being conducted pursuant to FAR 2005-95 dated January 13, 2017 Part Subpart 12.6 and FAR Part 13. The Request for Quote (RFQ) number is EE133E-17-RQ-00144  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541712 &ndash; Size Standard 1,000 employees.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  1.	Background The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) have RF Spectrum Management responsibilities. NOAA satellites have multiple missions, and involve GSO and Non-GSO satellite systems, with a broad range of environmental earth sensing. Such information provides meteorological data in real-time to Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps tactical ground weapon stations and navy ships worldwide.  NOAA data collection relies on radio frequency (RF) downlinks from satellites and instruments commanded by NESDIS.   NESDIS further supports the NOAA mission with telemetry, tracking, and command of the NOAA satellite constellations via spectrum dependent links.  NESDIS also operates the Polar Operational Environmental Satellite (POES), the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), and the Ocean Surface Topography Mission (OSTM/JASON-2/3), and many other satellite networks.  All data collected from the satellites/missions and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) is used to provide timely and critical environmental information to other Government Agency operations.    The GOES R series satellites, scheduled to launch in FY2016, will be comprised of improved spacecraft and instrument technologies, which will result in more timely and accurate information.    The National Broadband Plan requires NOAA, and other Government agencies, to potentially share existing heavily used Government spectrums with commercial broadband.  This will present a challenge to NESDIS Program Offices in terms of RF spectrum access and resources, requiring a high level of strategic planning and participation in spectrum regulatory bodies (i.e. International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and Inter-American Telecommunication Commission (CITEL).  2	Objective Under this spectrum support task, the subcontractor will support a broad range of RF Spectrum technical, engineering, analytical/empirical, and management functions pertaining to the responsibilities inherent in Department of Commerce/NOAA/NESDIS.  The primary task areas are spectrum engineering, Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S), and technical and spectrum management analysis. 3.	Tasks 3.1	Primary Responsibilities At a minimum, the following support tasks are required: ITU-R and Domestic Regulatory Support The following is the ITU-R support:  1.	Prepare and defend technical analysis documents using modeling and simulations tools (Visualize, Matlab, etc.) as needed.   2.	Participate in different national and international spectrum working groups and meetings to achieve desired policy outcomes by reviewing and commenting on national and international contributions.  3.	The international groups supported may include: ITU-R working group meetings (example Study group 3, 4, 5 (including 5A, 5-B, 5-C and TG-5/1) and 7 or other groups as required), WRC Conference Preparatory Meeting(s) (CPM), and World Radio Communication Conference(s) (WRC) as needed.  Other international meetings will be supported as required by the customer. Support important NOAA/NESDIS WRC-2019 Agenda Items (AI) including but not limited AI 1.13 (IMT), AI 1.14 (HAPS) and AI 1.16 (RLAN) and others are required  4.	Support ITU-R Regional groups such as CITEL by participating in meetings as required by NOAA/NESDID  5.	Defend NOAA/NESDIS national and international radio spectrum position for current and future WRCs  6.	Support work dealing with National groups include a variety of frequency policy organizations including, but not limited to, National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), NTIA Interdepartmental Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC), NTIA IRAC Technical Subcommittee (TSC), and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) meetings as needed. Support Space Systems Subcommittee (SSS), chaired by NTIA as required.  7.	Support development of policy position papers to successfully advance the required position in other international forums ad needed.   8.	Apply knowledge of spectrum-use policy to determine proper and efficient use of radio frequency spectrum allocations.  9.	Provide support as needed on EMC and EMI issues.  CITEL Support Note: The working language for CITEL meetings is Spanish.  It is extremely helpful to NOAA/NESDIS to have technical engineering support from Spanish speaking person(s), as this can be advantageous, when interfacing with CITEL delegates and decision makers.  The following are the required CITEL tasks:  1.	Consult with the NOAA/NESDIS to fully understand current plans, ensuring that spectrum requirements complement existing efforts and activities. Support important. NOAA/NESDIS WRC-2019 Agenda Items (AI) including but not limited AI 1.13 (IMT), AI 1.14 (HAPS) and AI 1.16 (RLAN) and others are required.  2.	Participate in national preparation meetings for CITEP PCC-II and other meetings as directed by NOAA/NESDIS.  3.	Attend CITEL PCC-II meetings in support of the NOAA/NESDIS.  4.	As directed by the NOAA/NESDIS, participate in international working groups and other meetings to achieve desired policy outcomes for the United States by attending with the U.S delegation meetings on spectrum management at the International. Telecommunications Union with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.   5.	Provide input contributions on technical topics as required. Perform analysis to determine causal sources of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) and propose mitigation techniques as required.  6.	Provide support to the NOAA/NESDIS in the development and presentation of contributions to US proposals at different ITU working parties.   7.	Assist the NOAA/NESDIS in the coordination of strategic spectrum planning to ensure that international and domestic allocations continue to meet U.S. requirements into the long-term future.   8.	Develop, as needed, analytical tools that might be required to conduct studies and simulations.   3.2	Recurring Sub Tasks:  Recurring sub-tasks that will be performed are: 1.	Perform analysis to determine sources of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) and develop possible mitigation techniques. 2.	Analyze technical reports and requests for system operating within the NOAA/NESDIS frequency bands of interest.  The purpose of the analysis will be to determine whether the NOAA/NESDIS requirement will be compatible with other systems or require mitigations. 4	Travel Requirements &bull;	Meetings &amp; Conferences 1	Small Satellite Conference: February 10, 2017 &ndash; five-day meeting for Domestic Satellite Coordination &ndash; San Jose, California 2	IMT Systems (ITU R WP 5D): February 22, 2017 through March 2, 2017 &ndash; Geneva, Switzerland 3	Space Radio communication Applications (ITU R WP 7B): April 11, 2017 &ndash; April 17, 2017 - Geneva, Switzerland 5	Deliverables 5.1 	Consultant Spend Plan  Within ten (10) business days of the start of work, the Subcontractor shall provide a spend plan that estimates the delivery date and amount of each invoice that the Subcontractor anticipates to deliver.

(e) After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.  (f) The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.  (g) Questions regarding items (a) through (f) within this language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.
