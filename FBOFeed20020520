<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue Request for Quotation RFQ5-75948-904 on a Sole Source basis for Research Development for Optically Thin Pixel Detectors for a Broadband X-Ray Polarimeter. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to procure the following from the Pennsylvania State University, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source: 1. Continuation of previous work on A:SI:H TFTS to thinner polymeric substrates (&lt;7.5 micron), 2. Evaluation of thin (100 nano-meter) low stress silicon-nitride as a TFT substrate by measuring surface roughness and thermal properties; and 3. Continuation of previous work on SU-8 microstructures to demonstrate suitable support posts for suspended microwell cathodes.   NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center will be involved in a Director's Discretionary Fund (DDF) project entitled, "Optically Thin Pixel Detectors for a Broadband X-Ray Polarimeter," in collaboration with the Pennsylvania State University.  Penn State's unique ability to fabricate thin film transistors onto thin polymeric substrates is an essential feature of the proposed research.  Penn State's faculty worked on the previous phase of the research in partnership with GSFC's scientists, acquiring a unique understanding of the physical and electrical characteristics of the microwells, and the ability to design well-matched readout systems.  This prior effort formed the basis of the development of thin film transistors as a microwell detector readout and NASA considers Pennsylvania State University uniquely qualified to continue this next phase of the research development plan in order to provide the required continuity and compatibility.    The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 10, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to enter into a sole source contract entitled, Risk Management Analysis for Decommissioned Sites, with the National Council on Radiation Protection (NCRP).  The period of performance for this project is approximately 16 months. The primary objectives of this work are to identify and analyze the current regulatory guidance and practice used by the NRC and EPA, and propose and examine optimal or appropriate methods to achieve consistency between these two management approaches.  To meet the ultimate objective and to have the greatest potential impact, this work must be performed by an organization that is independent of both NRC and EPA, and has substantial credibility for both its objectivity and coverage of the current spectrum of scientific thinking on radiation protection. NCRP is uniquely different from other organizations in terms of the institutional control exercised over the selection of committees, the independence and freedom of committee deliberations, and the absence of program or regulatory responsibility over the program issues under deliberation.  Neither the NCRP nor its constituent committees have immediate responsibility for a given study, or have a vested interest in the outcome of deliberations.  Nominees for membership on NCRP committees are subject to rigorous procedures for appointment, including assessment of the issue of potential sources of bias. These procedures ensure the selection of the most qualified scientists who represent a broad range of views and who as a group reflect the spectrum of scientific thought in a given subject area.  All committee reports undergo a thorough review in accordance with overall procedures prescribed by their charter.  This includes review by the authorizing committee as well as the entire NCRP.  This process assures that the assessment is objective and that the scientific data examined warrant the conclusions or recommendations made by the committee.  That independence, when combined with its broad expertise, clearly establishes that organization as the only source capable of meeting the minimum needs of the NRC. See numbered note 22.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) seeks a contractor to provide job analyses and suggested training courses for Disability Examiners (DEs), Medical Consultants (MCs), and Federal Quality Reviewers using the Developing a Curriculum Method (DACUM).  SSA is revising its training program for DEs, MCs in the State Disability Determination Services (DDS) and Federal Quality Reviewers.  The goal is to promote greater consistency among disability adjudicators and reviewers and increase customer satisfaction through more accurate disability determinations.  As a first step in developing the new training program, SSA needs to identify the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) for each of these positions.  A curriculum with specific training courses to address each of these KSAs can then be developed.  The DACUM is a process used to create descriptions of new and emerging jobs, identify specific relevant tasks necessary for a particular job, assess appropriateness of training, and design training programs.  The DACUM process involves: 1) Holding a 2-day focused discussion with 8 to 10 highly skilled participants, including 1 manager, with a facilitator trained in using DACUM and a recorder; and 2) Obtaining a printed document with the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for a particular job and suggested courses to acquire these KSAs.  Within fifteen (15) days after award of a contract, the contractor shall meet with SSA representatives to receive background material and discuss the project.  After this meeting, the contractor shall perform a DACUM beginning with the Medical Consultant position.  Not later than 120 days after the initial meeting with SSA, the contractor shall complete DACUMs for the MC, DE and Federal Quality Reviewer positions and provide reports for each to the SSA project officer.  SSA will select participants for the DACUMs from across the country and will provide participant names to the contractor. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541612.  The size standard for this NAICS code is $6.0 million.  This acquisition is being conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 regarding the acquisition of commercial items.  Solicitation number SSA-RFQ-02-0201, is scheduled for release on or about May 24, 2002, with quotes due no-later-than 14 calendar days thereafter.  The solicitation will be available for downloading from the Federal Procurement website at www.fedbizopps.gov.  HARD COPIES OF THE RFQ WILL NOT BE MAILED.  Telephone requests will not be honored and no bidders list will be maintained.  Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the FedBizOpps website to check the status of this requirement and to keep current with any amendments that may be issued.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  This is a 100% small business set-aside.  Offers received from other than small business sources will be deemed unacceptable and will not be considered.   All questions must be submitted via email to barbara.hands@ssa.gov.  See Numbered Note 1.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a request for quotation.  Submit offers on RML-RFQ #2021.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-07 dated 04/30/02. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334519 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis (LHBP)  performs research on multiple, diverse bacterial pathogen genomes and the host response to these pathogens. For host interactions and responses, the LHBP purchases and utilizes Affymetrix eukaryotic genome chips (murine U74 set and human U133 set). These chips are hybridized and processed in a laboratory (NIAID, Frederick, MD) utilizing existing Affymetrix GeneArray(registered trademark) Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite,  MicroDB, Data Mining Tool, and LIMS software database.   In the LHBP we have sequenced 2 bacterial genomes to completion and are in the process of finishing 3 others. Micro array expression analysis is performed on all completed bacterial genomes.  To date, the LHBP has micro arrayed 7 different, single bacterial genomes using our in-house Virtek SDDC-2 microarrayer.  Space limitations on in-house micro array slides, the need to microarray more genomes, including intergenic regions, and quality issues related to the in-house microarray slides has led the LHBP to formulate a need to purchase a custom GeneChip(registered trademark) probe array.  SCHEDULE:  Furnish one (1) Custom GeneChip(registered trademark) probe array.  The system must meet the following salient characteristics: 1) Need to have arrayed, on one chip, the conserved and unique Open Reading Frames (ORFs) and Intergenic regions for 6 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes.  2) Arrayed on one chip, the conserved and unique ORFs and Intergenic regions for 7 strains of Staphylococcus aureus.  3) Arrayed on one chip, the conserved and unique ORFs and Intergenic regions for Yersinia pestis.  4) Arrayed on one chip, all of the ORFs and intergenic regions for the following three bacterial genomes; Borrelia burgdorferi, Coxiella burnettii and Chlamydia trachomatis.  5) The array must be at a high density of at least 10 to the 6th power per cm to the second power (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  6) Must be made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270) so that reproduction is consistent and variation between chip lots is greatly reduced.  7) Must offer a high level of sensitivity that will enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000, equal to approximately 3-5 mRNA transcripts per cell.  8) Must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681).  9) Additional control sequences must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  10) The probe selection strategy must be based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and be able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria.  11) Must be housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044), which will provide for automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array.  12) The cartridge housing must be compatible with the NIAID Affymetrix system in Frederick, MD (NIAID) which contains: the Affymetrix Gene Array(registered trademark) Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and LIMS software database so that we may use these custom Gene Chip(registered trademark) probe arrays on existing infrastructure.

Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Postal Service will pre-qualify offerors in three functional fields that are capable of providing qualified personnel to perform the jobs (13 labor categories) described in the Statement of Work.  Pre-qualification is a process where a supplier?s ability to meet specific Postal Service requirements is evaluated.  After a review of the capability statements have been completed, those deemed most qualified (pre-Qualified) to perform the work will be awarded ordering agreements.  All qualified suppliers may not be placed on the pre-qualified list if the purchase team determines that a smaller group will provide adequate competition or that some respondents are considerably more qualified than others thereby precluding contract opportunities for the less qualified.  The USPS decision to pre-qualify suppliers is a business decision of the Contracting Officer. Pre-qualification does not constitute an award of the work nor a promise of any work in the future.  THE DUE DATE FOR SUBMISSION OF PREQUALIFICATION STATEMENTS IS JUNE 3, 2002.

"B" - All potential offerors should contact the buyer/PCO identified below for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition. If your concerns are not satisfied by the contacting officer an Ombudsman has been appointed  to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Ms Kim McDonald, Chief, Contract Policy Division, at 912-926-2604. Please be prepared to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to resolve your concerns.  "F" - This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application.

<SUBJECT>B -- B ? Cable Bulgaria Expansion Project Feasibility Study, Bulgaria
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-0270038A
<RESPDATE>062702
<ARCHDATE>07122002
<CONTACT>Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Phone 703-875-4357, Fax 703-875-4009, Email ekunene@tda.gov
<DESC>Submission Proposal Place:  Mr. Sean McCreery, Chief Financial Officer, Cable Bulgaria, 19 Tzar Boris III Blvd, 4th Floor, Sofia 1612, Bulgaria, Phone: 359-2-954-9249, Fax: 359-2-954-9834.  :
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to review and analyze Cable Bulgaria?s (CB) operations in detail and make recommendations for the further development of its network throughout Bulgaria.  

CB was formed in 1999 through the consolidation of five cable operators in Bulgaria:  Union Television, Globo, City Cable, TV Mix, and BINEX.  CB currently has investments in systems with a total of 157,000 subscribers, and manages systems with a total of 136,000 subscribers.  The company averages a 34% household penetration in their service areas.  A typical basic package on CB?s systems provides 60 channels, with a minimum of 36 channels.  Monthly fees for service range from 5-13 leva per month, with a weighted average of 8.3 leva (approximately $4.15).  They also charge either a small installation fee or a monthly fee for additional outlets.

CB has acquired a mixed group of systems.  As a result, many of the systems are technically adequate, but need to be upgraded.  At this point, only 15% of plant is hybrid-fiber coax (HFC)-ready (able to provide traditional CATV, as well as digital television, high speed internet access, telephone services and video on demand).  CB is also in the process of constructing a Sofia to Plovdiv fiber optic backbone that is 60% complete; 89 kilometers have been built and 67 remain to be completed.  

CB has done some Internet access and VoIP testing using Cisco equipment.  They expect to establish their first Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) in early 2002.  The most advanced portions of the plant are located in Sofia and Burgas.  A 4,800 home area in Sofia and a 7,000 home area in Burgas have been completely modernized.

CB?s management is planning to spend $20-25 million for acquisitions, paying up to $150 per acquired subscriber.  This would allow the company to grow by almost 150,000 subscribers.  

In the short term, their plans include providing HBO as a premium service and completing a fiber optic trunk line between Sofia and Plovdiv.  Over the longer term, their plans include instituting HSA (high-speed access) service, pay-per-view or video-on-demand, and telephony.  The company?s systems need to be upgraded in order to provide these services.  CB also plans to use its national fiber optic network to provide nationwide telecommunications services.  CB?s management plans to provide these new services if the demand for them exists.  Their position is to ensure that a market for the service exists before building the infrastructure for the service and then subsequently trying to market that technological capability.  CB therefore expects to spend up to $80 million to upgrade their systems and implement HSA Internet and telephony services.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $153,975 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, June 27, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Simulation, Training and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM), in conjunction with the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division's Contracting Office, has a requirement to provide helicopter pilot simulation training services for the U. S. Army Aviation Center's (USAAVNC) "Flight School XXI", located at Ft. Rucker, AL.  The "market research" conducted under FedBizOpps posting dated 12 Dec 2001, (Reference RFI-HT2, "69 - U.S. Army Aviation Training - Innovative Business Solutions/Training Approaches to Flight Simulation Training for Flight School XXI") is now complete. A twelve (12) year "Award Term" "Requirements" contract, with the possibility of earning eight (8) additional years, is the contemplated acquisition strategy for Flight School XXI. 

The successful Flight School XXI service contractor will be responsible for providing all equipment, providing operational and logistical support, and implementing technology upgrades and ensuring that trained helicopter pilots remain current with the latest aircraft HW/SW configuration.  A Cancellation Ceiling will not be included in the Request for Proposal (RFP) or incorporated into the resultant contract.  The target Flight School XXI contract award date is expected to be Jan 2003.  In the interest of involving industry in the acquisition process, interested offerors are asked to provide a draft Statement of Objective (SOO) and/or any draft RFP Sections: B, L and/or M to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) to assist in developing the formal Statement of Work/RFP.  All draft materials should be received by the PCO not later than 23 May 2002 and should not include any "business sensitive" information, as the Government intends to discuss draft submissions during a "Pre-Solicitation Conference" to be held on or about 11 June 2002 in Orlando, FL.  Issuance of a formal RFP will follow, with a "Pre-Proposal Conference and Site Survey" to be held during September 2002. 

More detailed information regarding the Flight School XXI  requirement (e.g., helicopter training manuals, aviation training manuals, facility blueprints, etc.) can be found under the "Sources Sought" page found on the World Wide Web at: www.ntsc.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm?client=stricom&men=OPA 

All respondents interested in participating in the Flight School XXI acquisition are requested to provide the following information: 

(1) Provide your business size in relation to NAICS Code 541330 (SIC Code 8711) size standard of $20M.  Also state if you are a small, small/disadvantaged, or certified 8(a) business, or other socioeconomic program. 
   
(2) State your interest as either a prime or sub contractor.  

Based upon "market research" conclusions, this acquisition is contemplated to be a full and open, negotiated acquisition, with the contract award based upon a best value "trade-off analysis". However, to assist the Government in establishing set-aside possibilities (FAR 19.5), small businesses are requested to provide their firm's specific capabilities to perform Flight Simulator Logistic services (e.g. technical expertise, personnel and managerial qualifications, past experience with similar services, proposed teaming arrangements, hardware/software capabilities, financial capabilities, etc.).

Interested parties should provide the above requested information not later than 23 May 2002 to the attention of Larry Grauert, PCO, and Jack Rowe, alternate PCO, at:  Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division, Code 25736, 12350 Research Pkwy, Orlando, FL 32826-3275; or via e-mail to:  Larry_Grauert@stricom.army.mil, and Jack_Rowe@stricom.army.mil.

<CONTACT>Tech.POC: Ann E. Corkum, Program Manager, 781-271-5996 PCO: David M. Conrad, 781-271-5996
<DESC>The Air Force Weather Agency is currently seeking qualified sources to conduct research in Superensemble Forecasting. The objective of this effort is to determine whether using high-resolution superensemble techniques will result in more accurate forecasting. The research would involve: a)Improving mesoscale modeling of precipitation forecasts. b)Demonstrating the strength of mesoscale superensemble forecasts through incorporation of research and operational mesoscale models. c) Examining the phase and amplitude of the diurnal change in warm season precipitation. d)Initializing the member models with Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data and TRMM algorithm. e)Determining the mesoscale precipitation forecasts predictability limits. f)Assessing the performance of precipitation forecasts using a variety of skill scores. g)Testing the sensitivities of superensemble forecast to potential optimizations. Superensemble Forecasting - Definition of a Qualified Source. To be considered a qualified source, the following information must be provided.  If this information is not provided, the source will not be considered for this project. The source must provide a qualification package of past work in the subject weather area.  Specifically past experience must be in the weather area devoted to extending the forecast past the traditional 24-hour barrier by applying advanced superensemble techniques.  Previous research must document work in the application of superensemble techniques to higher resolution models.  Additionally, research that is focused on applying superensemble techniques for precipitation forecast guidance from real time multi-mode and multi-analysis superensemble forecasts at a global model resolution is required.  The source must have access to a research facility to accomplish this project. The intent of this project is to determine the skill and predictability of a high-resolution superensemble forecast out to 72 hours.  The goal of this project is to generate more accurate forecasts pinpointing exact locations of strong precipitation systems. An Acquisition Ombudsman, Colonel Joseph P. Maryeski, Director, Commander's Staff, has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during proposal development. You should only contact the Ombudsman with issues or problems you cannot satisfactorily resolve with the program manager and/or contracting officer.  The Ombudsman role is to hear concerns, issues, and recommendations and communicate these to the appropriate government personnel. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality if desired. The Ombudsman does not evaluate proposals or participate in source selection. You can contact the Ombudsman at (781) 377-5106.

<DESC>Requirement is for overhaul of reparable, B-1B Load Arrestors NSN 1680-01-181-4175MH (PN 1171-3).  Description of Reparable Item: The item is designed to permit normal seat adjustment movements and rapid retraction of the B-1B seat carriage prior to ejection.  Under high load conditions, which tend to tilt the seat carriage forward, the load arrestor will lock and become a rigid structural member supporting the top of the seat carriage. It will also act as a support member preventing backward tilt of the seat carriage under wind loading conditions during seat ejections.  The arrestor consists of a self-contained hydraulic cylinder assembly, an internal piston and check valve designed to permit fluid flow past a piston at movement rates of 1 inch/sec in either direction (normal seat adjustment) and in retraction mode at a rate of 72 in/sec. The load arrestors must be overhauled when they leak fluid. Type of Contract: one-year, FFP requirements contract with three, one-year options. Item was designed by Goodrich to meet Rockwell specification L190C2024. Drawings are proprietary to Goodrich. The Government has no data or test equipment for overhaul, or repair, of this item. No GFP; No CAP.  BEQ is 60 ea/year. Contract will provide for G009 reporting with work requirements IAW Statement of Objectives.  Government required delivery is 8 arrestors per month starting 45 days after contractor receipt of assets.  Estimated issue date: 05 Jun 02 with proposal due 05 Jul 02. To: Universal Propulsions Co, Inc - CAGE 51998. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS .  DO NOT PROVIDE A PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  This is a Sources Sought Synopsis as well as a Request for Information for an advertising agency to publish leg notices for the United States Marshals Service.  The purpose of this synopsis is to (1) determine interest and capability and (2) obtain input from industry sources.  The USMS is seeking a full service advertising agency to assume responsibility for publishing legal notices.  The proposed contract will require the successful contractor to publish notices of judicial forfeiture actions in newspapers of general circulation in the 11 judicial circuits, and in the District of Columbia judicial circuit.  The text of the legal notices shall be prepared by the Government and transmitted to the contractor by task order. The successful contractor will arrange for publication in newspapers located within the judicial district where the property is located, and/or in the judicial circuits where the action was filed.  In addition to the text of the notices, the task order shall state the judicial circuits where the notices must be published, the first date of publication, and the number of times the notice must be published.  The successful contractor will be required to publish the notices in newspapers of general circulation as that term is defined in the industry, and to provide the Government appropriate certifications that the notices have been published.  The successful contractor will be required to provide account management, invoicing and record keeping of notices published.  

The USMS may award a single national contract, or multiple circuit contracts, with a potential performance period of five years, considering the base year and the four option years.  A single award may include all judicial circuits; multiple awards may include several judicial circuits.  The USMS is interested in industry ideas/suggestions as to the best method of identifying newspaper(s) in each judicial circuit that would be considered Anewspapers of general circulation", and that offer or could offer the lowest publication costs.  The USMS also is interested in how the services could be obtained using electronic data transmission and/or other electronic communications media.  We anticipate a Firm Fixed Price contract with reimbursable line items for actual publication costs.  Interested offerors should submit in writing  ideas/suggestions and identify whether it is a small or large business concern.  All responses should be submitted to Carolyn Hendrick, Contract Specialist, via e-mail at: Carolyn.Hendrick@usdoj.gov or fax to (202)353-1420.

Oak Ridge National Laboratory is preparing to construct a highly collaborative and multidisciplinary Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences (CNMS).  The CNMS will include a Nanofabrication Research Laboratory and a Nanomaterials Theory Institute and will address the national need for facilities and methods to support state-of-the-art research on nanoscale materials, structures, and phenomena.  The Center is developing candidate Research Focus Areas (RFAs) within and linking its three scientific thrusts in Soft Materials, Complex Hard Materials, and Theory/Modeling/Simulation.                                         

To engage the scientific community in further developing the Center's Research Focus Areas, and to identify strongly committed collaborators for building research teams, the Second Workshop on Nanophase Materials Sciences will be held June 23-25, 2002 at the Holiday Inn Select Downtown in Knoxville, TN, adjacent to the Knoxville Convention Center.  Because of the demanding schedules of many of the participants, the workshop will be completed within 2 1/2 days.  Following a welcoming reception and registration on Saturday evening (June 22), the workshop will open on the morning of June 23 with a Symposium on Nanoscale Science and Neutron Scattering.  Breakout working sessions of all of the Center's candidate Research Focus Areas will be held on Sunday afternoon and Monday, with a summary plenary session closing the workshop late Tuesday morning.                                               

Goals for the Workshop's Breakout Sessions are to identify collaborating groups and potential lead scientists; to discuss the Center's initial mode of operation; to consider initial leveraging opportunities, including collaborative research proposals submitted to DOE and/or other agencies in order to "jump start" selected Research Focus Areas while the Center is under construction; and, to more precisely identify the equipment / infrastructure / support needs of each Research Focus Area.         

The Workshop program, registration information, and detailed information about lodging and local travel connections are available (and will be periodically updated) at the Center's workshop web site: http://www.ssd.ornl.gov/CNMS/workshops.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Tampa, Florida, intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Raytheon Technical Services Company (Raytheon), 6125 East 21st Street, Indianapolis, IN 46219-2058. In 1996 NAWCAD Indianapolis was closed and privatized in-place in accordance with recommendations from the 1995 Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission.  Title to the preponderance of all personal property located at NAWCAD Indianapolis has been transferred to Raytheon.  Raytheon possesses land and facilities formerly comprising NAWCAD Indianapolis under the terms of a long term lease agreement with the City of Indianapolis acting by and through the Department of Metropolitan Development.  The requirement will be to provide supplies and services required to plan, manage, and execute engineering, manufacturing, and operational support for continuing USSOCOM programs, including but not limited to the Special Operations Forces Demolition Kit (SOFDK) and Remote Activation Munitions System (RAMS) programs.  These integrated functional capabilities were previously provided by the NAWCAD Indianapolis in support of the USSOCOM.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-(1)(2)(iii) services may be deemed available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government?s requirements. The term of the resulting contract is planned to be a one-year base period with up to four one-year options.  Raytheon is the only known responsible source that can provide the required integrated functional capabilities and services.  Interested parties may submit questions relating to this requirement to the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Tampa, Florida.  The Government retains the right not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice.  See Numbered Note 22.
