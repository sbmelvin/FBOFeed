The overall objective of this procurement is procure professional services over a 12-month period for the analysis, design and development of techniques for advanced segmentation algorithms that will incorporate the live wire method for digitized  x-ray images.

The following task are to be completed. All software delivered  will be in the MATLAB language, except as negotiated by the government. Subtask 1) Implement an extended capability live wire segmentation algorithm. This capability will include (1) extending the algorithm capability to accommodate segmentation of the uterine cervix images; (2) incorporating user editing capability, including the capability to sequentially  “undo” and  “redo”
previous control points and the associated segments of the segmentation; and (3) incorporating interactive user capability to rain the live wire segment to adhere to the specific type of edge currently being  followed, rather that the strongest edge in the neighborhood. Subtask 2) Collect spine x-ray reference segmentations. The work  will build an extended reference set of segmented vertebrae from the digitized images by collecting from at least two medical experts’ segmentations of vertebrae for approximately 1250 images of the digitized spine, according to specifications and methodology negotiated with the government, including both cervical and lumbar spine images for the NHANES II data set. Subtask 3) Implement classification algorithm for uterine cervix images. The implementation will automatically classify uterine cervix images for the presence of acetowhitened regions of size above a specified threshold. This work will incorporate the use of artificial neural networks or other advanced classification methods in a manner similar to the classification work that has been done for the digitized x-rays.
Subtask 4) Evaluate the uterine cervix classification algorithm. The performance of the algorithm for classification of uterine cervix images for presence of acetowhitened regions will be evaluated against a set of classifications by a medical expert, and supplied by the government.

For subtasks 3 and 4, the contractor  will use digitized x-ray images made available by the government. 	

Evaluation Criteria: (1) The investigator shall have at least 5 years experience as a researcher in advanced technical applications for biomedical processing, and shall have demonstrable expertise (by conference and technical journal publications) in the areas of advanced image processing, including biomedical image segmentation; artificial neural networks and classification methods, and the application of such methods to the classification of biomedical pathology in human subjects; and hands-on software skills in MATLAB and C/C++. (2) The investigator shall have demonstrable expertise in the application of advanced image segmentation and classification techniques to the NHANES II digitized x-rays. 
		
The University of  Missouri-Rolla is uniquely qualified for this work because of the expertise and experience of the principal investigator below ( Joe Stanley) in the specific area of  feature classification of digitized spine x-rays, combined with his extensive educational background and experience in advanced image processing. Dr. R. Joe Stanley is on the faculty of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Missouri-Rolla. Based on his professional training and over 5 years experience in both academia and the private sector, Dr. Stanley is uniquely qualified for this work.

<DESC>The National Park Service intends to issue a prospectus on July 9, 2004 for an invitation of proposals for the continuation of fifteen (15) canoe rentals, and/or kayak rentals, tube rentals, johnboat rentals, and shuttle service.  The businesses will be located outside the park, but will be authorized by contract to provide commercial services inside the park boundary.  The solicitation period is scheduled as July 9, 2004 - October 15, 2004. Ozark NSR extends along 134 miles of the Current and Jacks Fork rivers in the Ozark Highlands of southeastern Missouri.  The rivers are administered in three zones or districts: the Upper Current, Jacks Fork, and Lower Current.  Concessioners are assigned specific areas in which to operate. The new concession contract will be for 10 years.  The National Park Service has determined, in accordance with 36 CFR Part 51, Subpart F that the new concession contracts are qualified concession contracts and the anticipated annual gross receipts are not expected to exceed $500,000 in the first 12 months.  As satisfactory operators, the existing Concessioners will be preferred offerors and have a statutory preferential right of renewal to the award of a qualified (new) concession contract as provided for in PL 105-391, Section 403 and 36 CFR 51, Subpart E.  Under the right of preference, if the proposal submitted by the existing concession is not selected as the best proposal, the National Park Service will advise the existing Concessioner of the better terms and conditions of the best proposal that the existing Concessioner must match.  If the existing Concessioner does so (by amendment of its proposal) within the time allowed, it will be selected for award of the concession contract.  If it does not, the offeror that submitted the best proposal will be selected for award of the contract. Parties interested in obtaining a prospectus should contact Concession Specialist Peggy Tarrence by mail at Ozark National Scenic Riverways, P.O. Box 490, Van Buren, MO 63965 or telephone 573-323-4236, extension 231.  You must include in your request for the prospectus a delivery address that will accept a Federal Express package.  An electronic copy of the prospectus is not available.  The prospectus, when issued, will contain information on the business opportunity, the new concession contract, the proposal package and terms and conditions under which the National Park Service will award the new concession contract.  All parties interested in obtaining a prospectus should mail or bring a check or money order MADE PAYABLE TO "National Park Service", (NO CASH SALES).  A Tax Identification Number (TIN) or Social Security Number (SSN) must be provided on all checks.  The cost for purchasing a prospectus is $20.00 by mail or $15.00 if picked up in person at Ozark National Scenic Riverways, Headquarters Office in Van Buren, Missouri. Any offer, including that of the existing concessioner, must be received in the Concession Management Office of the National Park Service in Omaha, Nebraska, Midwest Regional Office, 601 Riverfront Drive, Omaha, NE 68102 no later than 4:00 p.m. on the response date shown above, in order to be evaluated and considered for an award of a concession contract to provide visitor services in Ozark National Scenic Riverways.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim until certified.  A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim.  The submission may be converted to a claim by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as a liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
       (d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision.

       (g) Within 10 days of the Contractor’s receipt of an adverse Contracting Officer’s decision on a claim, the Contractor may request, and Federal Prison Industries will participate in, non-binding alternative dispute resolution (ADR) by means mutually acceptable to the parties.  Any ADR shall be completed within 60 days of the Contractor’s request, unless the parties agree to a longer period.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Office of Policy/Office of International Programs has a need for program support for its’ International Technology Scanning Program, henceforth “Scanning Program.”   The Scanning Program serves as a means for identifying, assessing, and importing foreign highway technologies and practices that can be cost-effectively adapted to U.S. federal, state, and local highway programs.  This approach allows for advanced technology to be adapted and put into practice much more efficiently without spending scarce research funds to recreate advances already developed by other countries.  The Scanning Program makes use of expert teams that travel abroad to see first hand foreign highway innovations and practices in action that could benefit the U.S.  The phases of a typical international scan include pre-scan coordination and planning; assessment of foreign innovations and practices by U.S. transportation specialists; development of a scan report and other deliverables that describe and assess foreign innovations and practices; development of a scan implementation plan; implementation of scan findings in the U.S.; and tracking and documenting scan implementation and scan benefits.  In addition to playing a significant role in all phases of an international scan, the contractor will also be responsible for making travel and accommodation arrangements for all scan team members.  Scan teams are composed of members representing FHWA, individuals from the Departments of Transportation (DOTs) of the 50 States, local governments, transportation trade and research groups, the private sector, and academia.   Each international technology scan focuses on a topic of high interest to the domestic transportation community.  Topics are selected by FHWA through a careful screening process.  Successful implementation in the U.S. of the world’s best practices is a key goal of this program.  The Scanning Program has resulted in significant improvements and savings in road program technologies and practices throughout the U.S.  Scan studies have also exposed transportation professionals to remarkable advancements and inspired implementation of hundreds of innovations.  NO FURTHER SOLICITATION INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  This solicitation, all related documents, and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through the Electronic Posting System (EPS) at http://eps.arnet.gov under the “EPS for Vendors” option followed by selection of the “DOT” center.  Accordingly, no written, telephone, facsimile or email requests for the solicitation package will be accepted.  Interested parties can register at the aforementioned site for a free “Acquisition Notification Service” to receive procurement announcements by email.  Be sure to “Register to receive all notices from selected organization”.  Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it will be the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the EPS website for any solicitation amendments.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by FHWA.  For information concerning the above acquisition, contact the contracting officials listed above.

<DESC>NA The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) plans to issue a sole source Simplified Acquisition to the University of Greenwich, Old Royal Naval College, Greenwich, London, UK, to develop evacuation computer model software to predict the time periods necessary for occupants to evacuate passenger rail cars to a point of safety during emergency conditions.  The University previously developed a software model known as Exodus, which is the only model that incorporates occupant characteristics and behavior of individual passengers, as well as individual decision-making affecting real evacuation time.  This proprietary suite of software packages has already been tailored to provide computer-modeling capability for emergency evacuation from buildings, aircraft and ships.  The  contractor will be required to develop a prototype computer model for occupant emergency egress behavior using the Exodus software program for the most widely used type of passenger rail car in United States.  This procurement will be conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  Small business firms classified under NAICS Code 541990, Business Size Standard $6M, that are interested in proposing on this requirement must respond in writing no later than 15 days from the date of this publication that they possess the rights to the proprietary Exodus software model.  This proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority in FAR Part 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request fo r competitive quotes.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses received to this notice would normally be considered, solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The RFQ issuance will be on or about August 30, 2004.  Small business firms will be required to submit a maximum of three, but not less than two, pages of documentation in support of the above for evaluation prior to receiving a solicitation. No telephone requests will be accepted – only written requests for this solicitation will be accepted, however, we will accept requests via facsimile at (617) 494-3024, ATTN: Karen Marino, DTS-853.

<DESC>Operational Contracting, US Air Force Academy intends to award a sole source purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures to TNO Human Factors, Department of Skilled Behavior, The Netherlands.    This service is being acquired for the Department of Engineering Mechanics, HQ USAFA/DFEM.  The TNO Tactile Torso Display Device (TTTD) is a vest that contains small vibrotactile transducers (similar to the vibrating batteries in a cell phone).  This vest can be used to supply different types of information to the wearer.  To signal someone to look upward and to the left for a target, a transducer on the upper left chest of the wearer could be stimulated.  Multiple transducers could be activated to indicate a direction or some type of imminent danger.  The TTTD hardware and controlling software enable the researcher to investigate different uses of this technology.  Supplies and/or services are available from only one responsible source.  No other type of supply or service will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet this requirement.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  If no response is received by 23 August 2004, to the effect that comparable supplies and/or services are available that would be more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these supplies and or services though a sole source procurement with TNO Human Factors a sole source award will be made.

<DESC>The U. S. Coast Guard (USCG) intends to negotiate a sole-source acquisition with the Cooperative Institute for Limnology and Ecosystems Research (CILER) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.  The USCG is seeking to continue the study and analysis of the effectiveness of careful management of ballast tanks using a selected, but enhanced, suite of practices aimed at reducing the abundance of residual mud and organisms in transoceanic vessels that are scheduled as regular Great Lakes traders for the Calendar Year (CY) 2004 shipping season; and whose ballast tank structures includes a combination double-bottom side tank configuration and unobstructed access to these tanks via deck hatches rather than cargo hold hatches. This program, known as No Ballast On Board (NOBOB), began over the 2001-2002 shipping seasons by a consortium of Great Lakes institutions, including CILER and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL).  The work to be performed under this contract will include the following tasks:  1.  Study the effects of current best management practices on sediment in ballast tanks, 2.  Study ballasting patterns of salt-water vessels operating in the Great Lakes, 3.  Document and describe improved best management practices, and 4.  deliver quarterly progress, a draft final report, and a final report.  CILER was selected for this negotiation because of their unique expertise and past experience with the biologic and oceanographic impacts of ballast water management practices of transoceanic vessels on the waters of the Great Lakes.  CILER is in a unique position to most effectively and efficiently provide these studies, in that its personnel are considered the predominant experts on the interaction between ballast management practices and risks of biological invasions.  Contracting with CILER will avoid a substantial duplication of cost necessary to maintain the ongoing study conditions already funded by sources other than the USCG as part of a broader multi-agency program.  The proposed arrangement is estimated to save in excess of $1 Million which would be required to fund components of the existing program now available to participating organizations at no additional cost.  These duplicate costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Wake Forest University School of Medicine for continuation of the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS).  WHIMS is an ancillary study to the WHI Hormone Trials.  It is designed to study probable dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and global cognitive functioning in women 65 years of age and older participating in the E+P or E-alone hormone therapy trials.  Since the initiation of WHIMS in 1996, a total of 7,526 participants have been recruited, examined and followed to determine whether taking hormones (estrogen alone or estrogen plus progestin) would slow the decline of cognitive function in postmenopausal women.  Previous funding was provided by Wyeth Ayerst Pharmaceuticals.  The primary goals of the proposed continuation are (1) to complete the originally planned follow-up among women in the WHIMS E-only trial (2) continue the post-trial follow-up among women formerly enrolled in the WHIMS E+P trial to establish the impact of the cessation of E+P therapy on cognitive outcomes; and (3) provide analytical support to vigorously explore and publish WHIMS data.  The statutory authority applicable to this solicitation is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302.1.  The incumbent has the unique capability to provide the required services to the NHLBI.  See NOTE 22.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia intends to solicit on an Other Than Full and Open Competition basis for the acquisition of Administrative and Clerical Support Services at the Training Air Wing One (TW-1) located at Naval Air Station, Meridian, MS. The services will be accomplished through a modification extending the performance period under the existing purchase order N00140-01-M-0193.  The extension will consist of a 1-month period and two (2), 1-month options. The extension is for commercial services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (B3H Corporation, 51 Third St., Bldg. 1, P.O. Box 953, Shalimar, FL 32579-1700), under the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501(a).  The purpose of this extension is to allow sufficient time to complete the procurement process for a competitive follow-on contract.  The applicable NAICS code is 561110 with a size standard of $6M. The Government intends to acquire the services from B3H since they are the only source that currently has the personnel and infrastructure in place to perform the requisite services by 1 October 2004 without an additional 30-day phase-in period (starting 1 September 2004) that would be required from a different source.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all requests within forty-five days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  The Government will not pay for information received.  Responses to this synopsis should be mailed to the attention of Mr. Michael Placido Code 02P23D, FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia, 700 Robbins Ave., Bldg. 2B, Phila., PA 19111-5083.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-BAA-04-08-IFKA
<CONTACT>Lori Smith, Contracting Officer, Phone (315) 330-1955, Fax (315) 330-8029, Email Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil
<DESC>Introduction.  The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at the Rome Research Site is seeking firms to conduct applied research and development for innovative concepts and techniques to develop and field a Predictive Awareness & Network-Centric Analysis for Collaborative Intelligence Assessment (PANACIA) System of Capabilities.  This solicitation is concerned with developing and fielding the PANACIA System for utilization within the Air Force Air Operations Center (AOC) and the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) through spiral development over a three-year period.

The PANACIA program will employ and exploit existing technologies to provide early demonstrations and transitions to operational units.  It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies and provide a roadmap of continued spiral development over a three year program. The maturation required to meet the PANACIA objectives involve information fusion, geo-registration, terrain characterization and human-system interface technologies.  In addition to direct technology maturation, the PANACIA program will support other complementary activities including, integration, test and evaluation, modeling and simulation, data collection and management, and a distributed collaborative engineering environment.  Finally, the PANACIA program will provide for accreditation, documentation, training, and transition of technology to established operational sites.  The PANACIA program is sponsored by the Air Force Aerospace Command & Control and Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance Center (AFC2ISRC).

PANACIA is envisioned as an integrated, operator-focused, multi-intelligence fusion system that can ingest data from multiple ISR sensors and intelligence sources to execute the Force-on-Force Kill Chain (Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage, and Assess) and provide Situational Assessment tools that can be adapted to a variety of missions including at a minimum:  (1) IADS monitoring & alerting; (2) SCUD monitoring & alerting; (3) CSAR monitoring & alerting; and (4) Terrorist monitoring & alerting.  It is envisioned that four distinct spiral deliveries of PANACIA capabilities will be delivered and integrated into operational sites every 9 months.  These sites will be identified at the Bidder's Briefing, scheduled for 27 August and posted (see Section IV).

Technical Requirements.  
Data Integration: PANACIA shall be designed to ingest, process, fuse, reason on, and display the following types of information, as a minimum: Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) including SAR, EO/IR and Video, Human Intelligence (HUMINT), and Measurement and Signatures Intelligence (MASINT) including UGS (acoustic, seismic and magnetic) and MSI/HSI.   Projected data sources and access mechanisms will be discussed during the bidders brief.  

Functions:  PANACIA should incorporate the following functions: text processing of HUMINT and IMINT messages; real-time tracking of SIGINT, GMTI, Video, and Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS); multi-INT (Intelligence) fusion from various intelligence sources; development and exploitation of a spatially and temporally consistent knowledge database(s); and data extraction & reasoning regarding friendly and adversary forces.  

Other External Interfaces:  PANACIA shall also interface to other information systems such as: Automated Assistance with Intelligent Preparation of the Battlefield (A2IPB), Joint Targeting Toolbox (JTT), and ISR Collection Management (CMMA/PRISM/AIM).  More information will be presented at the Bidder's Brief and posted on the website.

Integration Environment:  PANACIA will employ the AFRL-owned Web-Enabled Temporal Analysis System (WebTAS) as a transition medium into the AOC and DCGS.  WebTAS is currently utilized in various Government agencies and has participated in various exercises, including JEFX 04.  The system is a flexible suite of generic analytical tools that enable an operator to quickly fuse, visualize, and interpret disparate sources of information, while remaining domain-tailorable to the user.  More PANACIA-WebTAS information can be found under the section on Integrator Responsibilities and will be presented at the Bidder's Brief and posted on the website.

Integrator Responsibilities.  
The PANACIA System Integrator shall: provide a total system architecture; establish and manage the infrastructure, interfaces, algorithms and database(s); coordinate software development and integration of fusion modules; and integrate multiple-sources of sensor and intelligence reports into an architecture capable of meeting the PANACIA program requirements.  Additional information will be presented at the Bidder's Brief and posted on the website.

Associate Contract Agreements will be required to ensure adequate support during spiral, transition and exercise activities.  The scope of WebTAS enhancements for the PANACIA Program will be presented at the Bidder's Brief and posted on the website.

Performance Criteria:  PANACIA system performance will include real-time and near-real-time system throughput, target location errors identification probability, and user-alerting to reduce targetable data uncertainty and other applicable performance measures.  Specific metrics will be developed in cooperation with the government and other PANACIA-coordinated procurements.  The interface must be user-definable to take into consideration the fact that current human analysts are experienced with specific information displayed in operator-designed views.  The output of this system shall be improved locational accuracy and identification (ID) of various ground mobile targets; actionable information that supports, but is not limited to the following capabilities:  (1) IADS monitoring & alerting; (2) SCUD monitoring & alerting; (3) CSAR monitoring & alerting;  and (4) Terrorist monitoring & alerting.

Program Schedule: The System Integrator shall provide a program schedule for each  capability listed above, outlining the milestones (including content, capability, benefit to the Warfighter and risk) for software delivery, test and integration into the AFRL Fusion Facility and spiral transitions to a select set of operation sites (Details of the AFRL Fusion Facility and the selected sites will be presented at the Bidder's Briefing and posted on the PANACIA website).

The program schedule should contain spiral developments and deliveries of PANACIA capabilities.  The spirals shall be 9 month cycles and consist of software builds, training, and integration into the AFRL Fusion Facility for testing and analysis as well as an AOC and DCGS.  This will require software to be in compliance with appropriate interface documentation such as Air Force DoDIIS Infrastructure (AFDI) compliance.  The following web site can be accessed for additional information:
http://extranet.if.afrl.af.mil/afdi/
Program Reviews, Transitions and Demonstrations: Program reviews will be conducted twice a year to track technical, financial and schedule performance and risk.  These reviews are expected to be conducted in conjunction with other PANACIA-related efforts.  An architectural design review shall be conducted approximately, one month after contract award.  The PANACIA System Integrator shall be required to coordinate (needs to be defined) with other complementary PANACIA program efforts.  The Integrator will also be expected to participate in periodic integration, transitions and demonstrations.  The PANACIA program expects to demonstrate partial or entire system capability at major DoD exercises such as, JEFX.  Offerors should anticipate supporting at least one DoD exercise.  Additional information will be provided at the Bidder's Briefing and posted on the website.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Neuromuscular Diseases Section (NDS), plans to procure on a sole source basis with Affymetrix Inc., 3380 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95051 for custom mitochondrial-specific11UM 100-3660 arrays. The NDS plans to perform research in the general area of nuclear and mitochondrial gene function, including gene expression profiles of muscle and subcutaneous fat tissue, and lymphocyte samples of HIV/AIDS patients.  The custom-arrays shall include the following features:  1)  include 4840 gene probes to incorporate the 37 mitochondrial genes, 1500 nuclear gene probes related to mitochondrial function, 1500 lipid gene probes, 1000 cytokine gene probes, 500 muscle gene probes and 300 internal control gene probes; 2) each probe will be represented 11 times on the chip to assure sensitivity and specificity; 3) each gene sequence will be screened for possible cross-hybridization and eliminated if likelihood for cross-hybridization with another sequence on the chip is higher than 5% (to eliminate possibility of false positive results); and 4) chips will be manufactured in one batch to assure precision of the process and function of the chip. The Affymetrix custom array gene chip offers maximum control over the probe and the smallest possible error margin in terms of production, application, and evaluation of the results. The unique characteristics of Affymetrix gene chip technology involves: 1) the possibility to utilize 25 base-pair oligonucleotides, precisely hybridized at a size of 11um; 2) precision of oligonucleotides to hybridize sample RNA to the chip; 3) the oligonucleotide chip allows for the hybridization of 4840 genes on one chip; and 4)  every gene is represented with 11 probes on the chip eliminating the necessity of run each experiment in triplicate. This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. Affymetrix, Inc. is the only organization known that has the aforementioned features that are required and believed to be unique and only their products will work with NINDS Government owned Affymetrix equipment.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on August 23, 2004.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) has a requirement for two (2) 300 Watt NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) Transmitters for the NWS Alaska Region Network.  Delivery shall be made F.O.B. Destination to a NWS site in Anchorage, Alaska within 60 days after award.  This acquisition will be accomplished using simplified acquisition procedures.  NOAA intends to negotiate this acquisition on a sole source basis with International Radio and Electronics Corporation (IREC) of Elkhart, Indiana for standardization reasons.  The NWS Alaska Region Network is comprised of NWR Transmitters manufactured by IREC and Scientific Radio Sales (SRS).  SRS no longer manufactures NWR transmitters.  The NWS Alaska Region performs its own maintenance and maintains its own spares depot.  Procuring the present requirement of two 300 Watt NWR transmitters from a source other than IREC will result in substantial additional cost associated with sparing and training that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Although NOAA expects that only IREC can provide the required equipment without substantial unrecoverable duplication of cost to NOAA, all responsible sources may respond to this notice by submitting a quotation not later than September 14, 2004 which shall be considered by NOAA.  A determination by NOAA not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of NOAA.  See Note 26.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of Electrical Distribution, Water and Wastewater Utility Systems at Tobyhanna Army Depot, Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania.
Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operation, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility systems replacement.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm(s) will be selected to assume ownership of the system(s) to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, tools, materials, and equipment necessary to own, operate, and maintain the utility system(s).  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc. of the systems to assure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, operate, and maintain the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of an Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility systems will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offeror's shall be submitted as directed by the RFP.  The Installation and utility systems being privatized are described as follows:

OVERVIEW
Tobyhanna Army Depot (Depot or TYAD) is located in northeastern Pennsylvania, near the town of Stroudsburg and covers 1,300 acres, 400 of which are allocated to the industrial complex. TYAD is the largest full-service communications-electronics maintenance complex in the Department of Defense. The Depot’s mission includes the design, manufacture, repair and overhaul of hundreds of communications and electronics systems. System categories supported by TYAD include communications, command and control, surveillance and target acquisition, airborne electronics, intelligence and electronic warfare electronics support equipment and power systems.

Electrical Distribution System Description
Tobyhanna Army Depot currently purchases bulk electrical power from Pennsylvania Power & Light Company (PPL) at 69 kV at a single delivery point. The delivery point is the Army-owned Tobyhanna Substation, originally constructed in 1981 and upgraded in 2000. The substation has two 12/16/20 MVA transformers; both were installed during the 2000 upgrade. The TYAD substation consists of a two-bay 69-kV structure, two power transformers, and a four bay 12.47-kV structure containing seven circuit breakers (four feeder breakers, one bus tie breaker, and two transformer breakers).
The electric distribution system at TYAD consists of both overhead and underground circuits. The majority of the overhead circuits are installed on single wood poles with conventional type insulators on wood cross arms. Pole-mounted distribution transformers are installed near individual load centers. The underground portion of the electric network, located in the industrial area, consists of both duct bank installations and direct-buried cable. Pad-mounted distribution transformers are located near load centers. A project currently funded is expected to be completed by the time of a decision on privatization will add two miles of duct bank and 26 manholes to the industrial area of TYAD. 
Many of the industrial area buildings have medium voltage transformers located inside the buildings. These are generally dry-type, primary unit substation transformers; none are oil-filled but two are silicone insulated. There are no interior transformers located inside vaults. Interior transformers are generally located on the first floor enclosed by a chain link fence. All were replaced in the early 1980s and generally supply a separate low voltage panel rather than a secondary section of the unit transformer. The Army will not relocate these transformers to outside locations due to cost and space constraints. 

Potable Water System Description
The potable water system at Tobyhanna was initially constructed in the 1950s and consists of a network of wells, storage tanks, water treatment facilities, pump stations, and distribution pipes. Water demand at TYAD has been approximately 345,000 gallons per day for the 12 months ended March 2004. 
Water Production, Treatment and Storage
Water is supplied to the potable water system from six deep groundwater wells. Operation of the wells is automatically controlled to maintain set levels in the transfer and storage tanks. Wells 1, 3, and 5 are used to fill a 100,000-gallon transfer tank. From this tank water is pumped using a booster station to a second storage tank with a capacity of 100,000 gallons. Wells 2 and 4 tie into the system after the booster station and supply water to the second transfer tank. Water from the second transfer tank is pumped through another pump station to two 600,000-gallon finished water storage tanks. A drop in water pressure to 20.2 feet activates the transfer pumping station and Well 6. From these two finished water storage tanks, water flows by gravity through two parallel 12-inch distribution pipes that supply the entire Depot.
Various treatment chemicals are added at each of the well houses for corrosion control and pH adjustment. Water produced from Well 3 passes through an air scrubber to reduce elevated levels of trichloroethylene (TCE) detected in the Well 3 aquifer. Gaseous and liquid chlorine is added to the water before entering the finished water tanks to provide a residual disinfectant throughout the supply and distribution system.
The water production, treatment and storage system is controlled by a state-of-the-art series of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). The PLCs are used to monitor and control equipment in response to system demands and are located at the following five locations:
•	Well 3 (Building 818) – PLC controls Well 3 and the air stripper located in the adjacent Building 819.
•	Well 1 (Building 216) – PLC controls Well 1, Well 5 (Building 219), Transfer Tank 1 (Building 217A) and Pump Station 1 (Building 215)
•	Well 4 (Building 231) – PLC controls Well 4.
•	Pump Station 2 (Building 1027) – PLC controls Well 2 (Building 1027), Storage Tank 2 (Building 1025) and Pump Station 2 (Building 1027).
•	Well 6 (Building 213) – PLC controls Well 6 water production, treatment and storage.
Water Distribution System
The TYAD water distribution system consists of approximately 11.5 miles of pipe ranging is size from 4 inches to 14 inches. Pressure readings collected during September 2002 were consistent throughout the system, with over 90 percent of the readings in the 60-70 psi range. In addition, there are approximately 66 water meters, 324 isolation valves, 107 fire hydrants and 36 backflow preventers. During August 2002, a thorough survey of 100 percent of the distribution system was conducted and a total of five leaks were detected: one water pipe break, one valve break, two hydrant breaks and a small leak.
Sample coupons of the distribution system were taken at four locations were removed and examined as a part of the August 2002 system analysis. Soil samples were also tested to assess the corrosion potential of the soil environment. Overall, the testing revealed a 50-year-old cast iron piping system that is in excellent condition, exhibiting no signs of corrosion or graphitizing, even though the pipe is unlined. The wall thickness of the pipe (based on the examination of the coupons) indicates near original wall thickness. Soil tests revealed that soil surrounding the pipes is generally not corrosive to cast iron or ductile iron pipe. Conclusions from the distribution system studies indicate that replacement or rehabilitation of the existing distribution pipe based on pipe integrity is not anticipated for a long time.
All 107 fire hydrants were located and inspected as a part of a September 2002 survey. The majority of the fire hydrants were found to be in good operating condition; however, 73 were observed to have at least a minor deficiency. Installation staff has indicated that the major deficiencies have been corrected and that all fire hydrants have been painted since the findings of the report were published.
A thorough analysis of the main valves was not included in the 2002 survey; however, many valves that were tested could not be operated due to age, damaged valve boxes or covered valve stems. No regular valve-exercising program is currently used by the TYAD Plumbing Division.
The Wherry Housing addition has been excluded from the distribution system inventory. This housing area water distribution system has been abandoned; however, future construction is likely at this location.
The potable water system is required to provide free service to approximately 24 houses and one business as a result of a negotiated settlement regarding TCE contamination of the water table serving these customers. Additional customers locating in this area will also be provided free water service under this settlement.

Wastewater Collection and Treatment System Description
The wastewater system at Tobyhanna was initially constructed in the 1950s and consists of a network of collection lines, manholes, lift stations and a treatment plant. Average influent is 240,000 gallons per day.
Wastewater Treatment Plant
The wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is designed to treat 802,000 gallons per day. Average influent is 240,000 gallons per day, approximately 30 percent of the design capacity. Effluent is discharged into Hummler Run, a stream that starts on the Depot. Approximately 8 percent of the influent is industrial-related. Pretreatment plants (not included in the privatization action) located in the facilities that generate these industrial waste streams remove heavy metals and other constituents that could adversely affect the treatment processes of the WWTP. As a result the WWTP exceeds the parameters of its discharge permit if these plants were not present.
The WWTP has undergone two major upgrades since its initial installation. Additional equipment installed to improve screening, secondary treatment, and solids handling were installed in 1981. Ultraviolet disinfecting and denitrification systems were installed in 1997 to enable the WWTP to meet NPDES water requirements as set by the state’s environmental agency. Process control units at the WWTP are monitored and controlled by a SCADA system.
Currently the sludge generated at the WWTP is landfilled. The existing sludge press is operated three days per week for eight hours. At this level of operation a mobile dredging contractor is required for one to two weeks to handle solids in the primary settling tanks. 
Collection System
The collection system includes approximately 29, 175 LF of pipe, ranging in size from 4" to 14".  There are a total of 136 manholes, and 8 lift stations.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.

SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a)   Subject to the provisions contained herein, award will be made to an offeror(s) who is/are deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements, and whose proposal, judged by an overall assessment of the evaluation criteria and other considerations specified in this solicitation, represents the Best Value (Technical Factor/Price Trade-offs) to the Government.  It is the Government’s intent to award without discussions; however, in accordance with FAR 15.306, should discussions become necessary, the Government reserves the right to hold them. If this occurs, a competitive range may be determined and Offerors notified in accordance with FAR 15.503. The competitive range may be limited for purposes of efficiency in accordance with FAR 15.306 (c)(2). Offerors are urged to reflect their best possible potential price(s), since less than the best potential price(s) could result in exclusion of the proposal from further consideration. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest proposed price; however, the degree of importance of price as a factor will become greater as the proposals approach equality.  The greater the equality of proposals, the more important price becomes in selecting the Best Value to the Government.  Unrealistically high or low proposed prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from the competitive range based upon assessment that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.
            
(b)   All proposals will be evaluated by a team of Government personnel to determine the extent to which each offeror demonstrates a clear understanding of the requirements of the RFP.  The offeror shall submit a proposal that completely addresses all evaluation areas, specifically identifying how each evaluation requirement will be satisfied.  The evaluation team will rate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror’s written proposal.
The following adjectival ratings are listed and defined below: 

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

     (1)  FACTOR 1. Technical.   – This factor is for the purpose of rating how well an offeror will perform and complete the project.  The likelihood for successful performance of the work will be evaluated based upon the following four subfactors which are ranked in descending order or importance.  Subfactors are arranged in descending order of importance, with Subfactor 1 being most important, and Subfactor 4 being the least important.  

Subfactor 1: Economic Involvement of Local Iraqi Firms and Workers:  Explicitly state or describe your goals for the maximum participation of 
(a) Iraqi subcontractors, vendors, suppliers, consultants, etc., as well as 
(b) Iraqi employees in the management, supervision, professional engineering and technical fields to include skilled and unskilled labor in performing the contract.
(c) The Offeror shall describe how it intends to employ workers residing in the Governate of Diyala.

Subfactor 2: Capacity to Perform Superior Quality Work:  Each offeror is to describe how its company’s methods and procedures will be applied to ensure that only superior quality work is performed by its own work force and all of its subcontractors in accordance with the contract requirements. 

Subfactor 3: Capacity to Perform Work in a Timely Manner:  Offerors are to describe how their management methods, procedures and schedules will be applied in order to monitor progress of the project during construction, provide timely reports and implement corrective actions in order to make-up for lost time/schedule. 

Subfactor 4: Ability to subcontract 10% of contract value to U.S. Small Businesses:  Offerors are to describe how they will achieve a mandatory requirement to subcontract 10% of contract value to U.S. Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-owned and Veteran-owned businesses.    



(2)  FACTOR 2. Price.  

 	    (a) IAW FAR Part 15.305 (a)(1) Cost or Price Evaluation, this competitive procurement will establish the basis for price reasonableness.
	
              (b) Total evaluated price, for award purposes, will be based upon the total price proposed.

IMPORTANCE OF FACTORS

[c] Factor 1 (Technical) is equal in importance to Factor 2 (Price). Subfactors under Factor 1 are arranged in descending order of importance, with Subfactor 1 being the most important and Subfactor 4 being the least.  

The adjectival ratings to be used in this best value source selection are listed and defined below:


“EXCELLENT” is defined as any proposal that can be awarded “as submitted” and contains no deficiencies and/or weaknesses.  It meets or exceeds the Government’s minimum objectives/requirements and the Government is confident that the offeror can successfully perform the services.   

“GOOD” is defined as any proposal that can be awarded “as submitted” and contains no deficiencies and/or weaknesses.  It meets or sometimes exceeds the Government’s minimum objectives/requirements and the Government is confident that the offeror can successfully perform the services.  Some improvement is possible or the proposal could have contained more detail.

“ACCEPTABLE” is defined as any proposal that has an adequate overall presentation, but some areas less than thorough in analysis or detail; fair probability of success; meets minimum requirements, improvement possible in some major areas.

“MARGINAL” is defined as any proposal that contains significant deficiencies and/or weaknesses.  The proposal fails to meet some of the objectives/requirements, contains significant deficiencies/weaknesses/ disadvantages and substantial improvement is necessary.  The proposal, however, may be correctable only with a significant re-write of the proposal.  

“UNSATISFACTORY” is defined as any proposal that contains major deficiencies and/or weaknesses that prohibit successful contract performance and/or could only become eligible for award if it were substantially revised.  The proposal presents an inadequate presentation and fails to meet the objectives/requirements.   The Government has no confidence that the offeror can successfully perform the services.

(d) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award

Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items with its offer. This provision is attached to this combined synopsis / solicitation.  See attachment 9.

The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items, as augmented by the Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) applies to this acquisition.  See attachment 11.

The clause at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders—Commercial Items, as augmented by the Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) applies to this acquisition.  See attachment 12.

<DESC>This synopsis/solicitation is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on-Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO in unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. This constitutes Amendment 0001 to N000178-04-R-2031 issued for the purchase of Office Automation Services. a.The first purpose of this amendment is to extend the closing date from 18 August 2004 to 25 August 2004. b.The second purpose of this amendment is to change the name of the offeror of the LINK eOffice System from General Dynamics to Network Marketing Solutions, Inc. c.The third purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions submitted in response to the RFP issued 29 July 2004. d.The questions and answers are identified as follows: (1)QUESTION:  What are the license requirements in terms of the number of users for the process automation and workflow system? (1)ANSWER:  There should be no license requirements as the total has the potential to be very large and entail an international audience. (2)QUESTION:  What will be the maximum number of concurrent users in the system?  (2)ANSWER:  Unlimited. (3)QUESTION:  Has the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division selected the LINK eOffice System as the product for the process automation and workflow system? Can an Offeror propose an alternate product that meets all the specifications listed in the synopsis? (3)ANSWER:  The procurement is not sole source.  The brand name product or equal is required.  Offerors may propose a product that meets all of the combined synopsis/solicitation’s specifications.  Offers submitted on the basis of an equal product shall provide a matrix comparison, by SOW paragraph, of the equal product to the brand name product to demonstrate that the product meets the required specifications and characteristics. (4)QUESTION:  Is there a preferred operating environment? (4)ANSWER:  Web based. No plug-ins. (5)QUESTION:  Can the proposal submission date of Aug 16 be extended by a couple of days? (5)ANSWER: The combined synopsis/solicitation closing date is extended to 25 August 2004.   (6)QUESTION:  Please explain the notation of the General Dynamics solution called LINK eOffice.  (Offeror’s name deleted) has an equivalent software solution and I am not certain of the significance of the GD solution.  (6) ANSWER:  As amended in section (b) above, the LINK eOffice is a product developed and licensed by Network Marketing Solutions, Inc. and not General Dynamics as originally stated. A detailed description of the LINK eOffice was provided in the original combined synopsis/solicitation. The Government seeks to procure either the LINK eOffice or another offeror’s product, if the offeror demonstrates how their product is equal to the LINK eOffice brand name product. An offeror demonstrates this via a matrix comparison as described in the original combined synopsis/solicitation. (7)QUESTION:  The requirements call for a firm, fixed price response.  However, there are several important parameters that are missing from the RFP, the absence of which make an FFP response quite difficult.  In order to calculate the correct software and hardware requirements, we need number of named users, number of concurrent users, amount of content and documents to be managed, and required response time.  In addition, we would need to know any operational requirements such as required availability, failover, and hardware preference. (7)ANSWER:  For number of users, see Answer 2. There are to be no restrictions on the number of named users, number of concurrent users, or the amount of documents. Required availability will be 24/7. As this is to be a web-based solution, the only hardware would be on the server side (i.e. at the offeror’s facility) and that would be left to the offeror to determine as part of their solution. (8)QUESTION:  The requirements specify that the system must be operation 14 days after contract award.  This is an unusually short period of time in which a new solution could be installed.  Typically, there is time provided in the task order to documentation of requirements, software installation, system testing, user acceptance testing, and production rollout. (8) ANSWER:  The initial specifications were for implementation on date of contract award. The Government is not looking for offerors to create a new solution, but rather implement an existing solution in a timely manner. As a web based solution, the software would be on the server side (i.e. located at the offeror’s facility). That is why the combined synopsis/solicitation states the brand name or equal is required to be up and operational no later than 14 days after contact award rather than delivered and installed during that timeframe. e.All other information remains unchanged.

The Marine Corps Systems Command is seeking information from any commercial source capable of providing collapsible fuel tanks fabricated from Butadiene Nitrile or Butadiene Nitrile/other type elastomer blended material and complete with fittings and accessories.  Collapsible coated-fabric tanks are intended for use as temporary storage containers for kerosene-based fuels such as: diesel fuels, military aviation turbine fuels (JP-5 and JP-8), and commercial aviation turbine fuels (Jet A and Jet A-1).  Collapsible coated-fabric fuel tanks are used for storage of kerosene-based aviation fuels within the Marine Corps Tactical Fuels Systems (TFS).  TFS systems are used in an expeditionary environment to transfer, store and dispense for the operating forces.

The tanks are required to provide a twelve-year shelf life, and three-year service life.  The tank shall be of durable design and construction to tolerate the extreme conditions and rugged-use to which it will be subjected.  It is required to have high levels of reliability and durability.  The tank and components shall withstand folded storage at ambient temperatures from minus 30 degrees Farenheit to 160 degrees Farenheit, without damage or leakage when subsequently filled with fuel.  The tank and components shall be suitable for operational use at ambient temperatures from minus 25 degrees Farenheit to 140 degrees Farenheit.  The tank shall not be damaged during service life when exposed to relative humidity up to 100 percent.  The tank shall be suitable for use in continuous contact with all environmental conditions.  The tank shall be furnished with two 4-inch male camlock fittings located on opposite ends for receiving and issuing connections.  There shall be no leakage or seepage when the tank is filled to its rated capacity with fuel.  The tank shall have a 10 percent minimum over-capacity fill without rupture or weakened areas, or leakage or seepage of contents.  The color of the tank exterior (the coating of the coated fabric, seams, cap stripping and chafing patches), hoses and berm liners shall be in accordance with FED-STD-595, color chip 33446 (sand matte), general match.  The tank shall be permanently marked with identification and caution labels.  

The dimensions of the current tanks used in the TFS systems: 

Size	Dimension
3,000 Gal	14 ft X 14 ft
20,000 Gal	28 ft X 28 ft
50,000 Gal	25 ft X 65 ft

<CONTACT>LISA HAYES PURCHASING AGENT 3034452606     lhayes@do.usbr.gov;
<DESC>Sources Sought (Best Value) The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a requirement for Environmental Consulting Services to Develop a Powerpoint presentation which articulates the benefits of interpretation to Reclamation, and Organize and develop a professional development training module that focuses on interpretive master planning.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and using the best value method.  The requirement of this best value method is that contractors interested in this procurement have some knowledge of the following areas below (see paragraph 4 - Contractor Qualifications) and will be evaluated, along with price.  1. INTRODUCTION:  Reclamation hosts 90 million recreation visits each year and that number is increasing.  This presents a significant opportunity to help achieve Reclamation's mission through public education and interpretation.  Thus, this project proposes a multi-faceted strategy for enhancing Reclamation's understanding, skills, and abilities in interpretation, including interpretive planning and the development of interpretive media and services.  For the purposes of this statement of work, the following terms and concepts will apply to the proposed strategy: 1.1 Informal Education or Informal Learning - Teaching and learning that takes place in non-traditional settings (i.e., not formal K-12 education) such as recreation areas/parks, forests, reservoirs/lakes, nature centers, visitor centers, museums, science centers, open spaces and natural areas, and historic sites. With this type of learning, participation is voluntary, learning is self-directed, motivation is intrinsic, and involvement is often short term such as in many recreation opportunities.  Interpretation and environmental education are types of informal education. 1.2 Interpretation - A communication process that forges emotional and intellectual connections between the interest of the audience and the inherent meanings in the resources (National Association for Interpretation, 2003).  Interpretation is typically classified as:  (a) personal - that which utilizes staff or volunteers in its delivery such as living history, storytelling, walks and talks, tours, interpretive theater, and so forth (b) non-personal - that which does not require staff or personnel in its delivery such as signs, exhibits, and publications  (c) facilities - those buildings or built facilities that might utilize both personal and non-personal media, but which serve as a focal point for visitor information, orientation, and wayfinding 1.3 Environmental Education - a learning process that increases people's knowledge and awareness about the environment and associated challenges, develops the necessary skills and expertise to address the challenges, and fosters attitudes, motivations, and commitments to make informed decisions and take responsible action toward a sustainable environment (UNESCO, Tbilisi Declaration, 1978) 1.4 Interpretive Planning - the decision-making process that blends management needs and resource considerations with visitor desire and ability to pay (with time, interest, and/or dollars) to determine the most effective way to communicate the message to targeted markets (Brochu, 2003) However, few staff in Reclamation has responsibilities or competencies which focus directly on interpretation/education.  In addition, consistent guidance across the agency for interpretive media and services does not exist.  Increasingly, due to the growing numbers of visitors at Reclamation sites, the agency recognizes the need for enhancing its interpretation capabilities.     The acronym I/EE (Interpretation and Environmental Education) will be used throughout the statement of work to represent the predominant form of informal learning in recreation settings as described above.  However, I/EE can also represent public relations, law enforcement, and maintenance efforts that impact or influence visitor awareness, learning and/or behavior as part of a recreation experience.  2. BACKGROUND:  The recreation and tourism industry is the Western States' largest industry and the nation's second largest employer.  National surveys show that water-based recreation activities, such as those at Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) reservoirs and lakes, are among the most popular of all outdoor recreation activities.   Currently, there are about 90 million visits to Reclamation's designated recreation areas each year.  These recreation visits represent 90 million potential opportunities for educational encounters with visitors to Reclamation sites.   In its Recreation Management Policy, Reclamation acknowledges its role in education by suggesting that:  (a) The natural, historical, and cultural resources entrusted to Reclamation be protected, conserved, preserved, enhanced, and interpreted  (b) Necessary planning studies, research, assessments, and public involvement processes be conducted in conjunction with managing partners, to provide recreation facilities, opportunities, and services commensurate with public needs and Reclamation responsibilities and objectives    (c) Active partnerships, outreach and communication efforts are promoted with stakeholders, the Congress, and the public to ensure successful implementation of recreation management actions The mission of Reclamation is to manage, develop, and protect water and related resources in an environmentally and economically sound manner in the interest of the American public.  It is further stated in Reclamation's vision statement that through leadership, use of technical expertise, efficient operations, responsive customer service and the creativity of people, Reclamation will seek to protect local economies and preserve natural resources and ecosystems through the effective use of water.  Water for agriculture, industrial, and municipal uses as well as water for hydropower are priorities of the agency. 3. SCOPE:  The primary purpose of this statement of work is to describe a multi-faceted strategy for building institutional capacity in education and interpretation within Reclamation that is based on Reclamation-wide needs and priorities.  The statement of work has two primary objectives: (a) Convert managers and field staff into advocates and practitioners of interpretation by describing how interpretation benefits them directly in their work, how it benefits Reclamation at-large, and how it benefits Reclamation visitors as consumers of recreation and resource experiences.      (b) Enhance staff capabilities in interpretive planning to ensure consistency in all of Reclamation's planning efforts.     4. CONTRACTOR QUALIFICATIONS: For potential Contractor to be considered qualified for this scope of work, firm or individual(s) should possess the following: (a) Knowledge and demonstrated experience in interpreting the construction, operation, and maintenance of water development projects including dams, powerplants, water conveyance features, visitor centers, and water-based recreation activities and developments. (b) Familiarity with Reclamation's policies and programs. (c) Advanced degree(s) in natural resource management, outdoor recreation, interpretation, informal education, planning or related field or demonstrated commensurate experience in same or similar disciplines. (d) Working knowledge of and demonstrated experience in interpretative planning as it relates specifically to natural resource or land management agencies.  Contractor will be able to document no less than 5 years experience and no fewer than 3 completed interpretative plans that demonstrate knowledge of and experience in interpretive planning and resource agency management and planning. (e) Effective written and verbal abilities for effective communication with diverse groups (resource managers), various stakeholder groups, planners, general public, other interpretive specialists).  Advanced communication abilities and/or teaching experience highly desirable. (f) Demonstrated ability to integrate technology (e.g., Microsoft PowerPoint, Freelance, Adobe Illustrator, Publisher or similar design/presentation programs) as an effective teaching and/or communication tool. It is anticipated that the performance period shall commence upon date of award through 18 months to complete all tasks.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541620, with a small business size standard of $6.0 Million.  The Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued on or about September 1, 2004.  Interested sources may access the RFQ No. 04SQ810163 from the internet website address at http://ideasec.nbc.gov/.  Inquiries interested regarding this procurement please e-mail Lisa D. Hayes at lhayes@do.usbr.gov.  See Note 1.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting market research to acquire a better knowledge and understanding of industry capabilities and availabilities associated with soft shelters (tents) for possible use in support of Marine Corps’ operations, including but not limited to command and control operations.  MARCORSYSCOM is currently interested in obtaining specific information on three sizes of tents; approximately 120-200 sq. ft., 400-500 sq. ft., and 600-700 sq. ft. (small, medium, and large, respectively).  The square footage desired is to be useable, unencumbered (no center poles) floor space.  The information requested:  (1) should address the shelter’s capability of meeting Federal Standard 191 (Test Method 5903.1, minimum) or equivalent flame spread on all materials; and, (2) should address the shelter’s blackout capability.  Regarding blackout capability, respondents should discuss the shelters’ capability of precluding an exterior translucency when using standard lighting, to include quick exit/entry without compromising the blackout capability.  Additionally, the Marine Corps’ most desirable attributes are shown below in descending order of importance.

·	Rapid set-up and strike with a minimum amount of manpower.
·	Quick set-up under canopy, so that operational elements can be deployed in the shelter while remaining shelter set-up tasks are being completed.
·	Lightweight, able to be efficiently packed (minimum cube-space requirement), and durable enough to sustain considerable erect, strike, wind and rain cycles.
·	Capable of capturing and isolating power and communication wiring.
·	Capable of providing means to suspend/support lighting and other items such as map boards and view screens from walls and ceiling.  
·	Capable of leaving power and communication wiring in the shelter during erect/strike and pack-out.    

Other desirable features include: 
·	Soft fabric floor.
·	Multiple doors with Tent Extendable Modular Personnel (TEMPER) door rings or the ability to have a TEMPER door ring adaptor.
·	Windows with screening.
·	Power/communication cable and ductwork pass-through openings in walls.
·	Vehicle booting kits.
·	Repair kit.
·	Collective protection or the ability to provide Collective protection.
   
The Buy American and Berry Acts will apply to any contractual instruments that may result from potential Marine Corps shelter acquisitions addressed above.

AT NO COST TO THE GOVERNMENT, all respondents having products that they believe adequately address the Marine Corps’ shelter desirable attributes are requested to submit four copies of their product materials (i.e. related brochures, descriptions, or any other pertinent product documentation).  Responses should include statements that demonstrate how their products satisfy the Marine Corps most desirable features listed above.  Written responses shall be received by close of business on 8 September 2004.  Responses shall be submitted to Marine Corps Systems Command, Assistant Commander for Contracts, Attn: Scott Bishop, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134.  No telephonic responses will be considered.  Point of Contact:  Scott Bishop, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-432-3265, Fax 703-432-3262, Email: bishopsp@mcsc.usmc.mil.

Assignments involve substantial depth of analysis of many different and unrelated factors and processes for reaching a price recommendation on contractor's proposed cost elements.  Decisions involve interpretation, analysis, and negotiations regarding modification of contract terms and conditions, evaluation of contractual progress, and identification and solution of problems involving contracts assigned.  Factors vary for each situation because of variations in the terms of the contracts, products and services involved, and contractor capability and characteristics, i.e., the relationship with corporate headquarters, previous experiences, and degree of cooperation.  The work requires making final decisions on a variety of issues, such as cost and price allowability, negotiating settlements, resolving legal and technical problems, approving or disapproving expenditures incurred, estimating the percentage of completion for payment of fixed-fee, and fairness of salaries paid to Contractor’s employees. 

5.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

<SUBJECT>B--Review and Analysis Services - Title "Investigation for Development of the Salvinia Weevil for Biological Control of the Aquatic Weed, Salvinia molesta, in the Lower Colorado River".
<DESC>Notice of Intent 1. INTRODUCTION: These investigations are intended for development of the salvinia weevil for biological control of the aquatic weed, Salvinia molesta, in Lower Colorado River water facilities administered by Reclamation and cooperating agencies. 2. BACKGROUND: Giant salvinia has spread from its initial site of infestation near Blythe, California, down the Palo Verde West Drain Canal, into the Colorado River, down to Imperial and Morelos Dams and into the Imperial Irrigation District and irrigated farmland in Northern Mexico.  The giant salvinia weevil, Cyrtobagous salviniae, has been shown to be an effective biocontrol on infestations in Texas, South Africa, and New Guinea.  USDA-APHIS, in concert with the Lower Colorado River Salvinia control task force, determined that the salvinia weevil biocontrol was the last practical control method available.  After extensive lab testing in California, Texas, and Florida, the insects were finally released in July of 2003. 3. SCOPE: Activities will include development and implementing study components for evaluation and monitoring of biological control insects for management of giant salvinia.  This work will involve a number of field trips to the Colorado River demonstration site for environmental evaluation and monitoring.  Other activities include analysis of data and writing a final report.  A presentation of the findings will be made at the annual meeting of the North American Lake Management Society. 4. CONTRACTOR QUALIFICATIONS: Graduate student / PhD candidate with expertise in biology of salvinia weevil also aquatic plant ecology and aquatic biology. It is Reclamation's belief is that Mr. Choi at the University of Arizona in the Department of the Environmental Research Laboratory/Department of Soil, Water and Environmental Science possesses the above experience and is the only source capable of providing Reclamation with the services required. This is not a formal solicitation.  However, individuals or concerns that respond shall be able to provide proof of their capability to meet the above requirements of the review board member prior to being provided a copy of the solicitation.

<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Information (RFI) - Research in the Neutralization of Biological Agents using Ionizing Radiation
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) solicits information about requirements, projects, and resources that will provide guidance for funding future research in the neutralization of biological agents using ionizing radiation. The Air Force Nuclear Weapons and Counterproliferation Agency (AFNWCA) and, specifically, the Advanced Technology Division, will use this information to possibly fund research in this area in support of current AFNWCA programs.  The goal of the project is as follows:

·	To improve the current models of biological agent neutralization from ionizing radiation.
·	To update and provide a complete set of references such that this portion of the project can be considered state of the art. 
·	To dovetail with current thermal neutralization research and with possible future experiments on thermoradiation.
·	To communicate and document the results in a manner consistent with peer-reviewed academic research.
·	To coordinate these results with the ongoing software development effort related to this project.
	
	The AFNWCA recognizes that within the domain of ionizing radiation research there are many "sub-domains" that are sufficiently diverse that they merit their own funding.  TO focus research in more specific areas, we would like to stress the importance of high doses delivered in short times.  The effects of high-energy photons, neutrons, and electron radiation are all important, as are dose-rate experiments.  Responses to this RFI will be reviewed by the AFNWCA and will help to guide future funding and direct future initiatives in this area.  This inquiry does not obligate the Government in any manner for any future acquisitions.  This is not a notice of intent to contract.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or otherwise pay for information solicited.
	
	The AFNWCA encourages users, consultants, systems integrators, and developers of life sciences research related devices, instruments, applications, databases, and systems to become involved with this process by responding to this RFI.  The RFI response can consist of pre-existing product documentation, but should preferably be organized and presented in accordance with this RFI.

This RFI seeks information to help the AFNWCA and the Advanced Technology Division make useful and efficient decisions in the life sciences research process.  As one of the first steps in this process, the AFNWCA wishes to assess the current state-of-the-art in ionizing radiation systems, and to become more informed regarding existing standardization efforts in the field.  Therefore, this RFI requests information on the following:
·	Currently available technology for ionizing radiation systems, 
·	Interoperability requirements and issues when using such systems, 
·	The results of prior analysis work in the domain, including models, as well as use case analyses, describing the behavior of biological organisms in such systems.
·	Proposed software components which would be composed together to create such systems, and potential interfaces between those components, 
·	Existing implementations, 
·	Existing standards and standardization efforts, legal issues, and their priorities.

Respondents are asked to address areas in which they have expertise and/or interest.  Please consider the purpose of this RFI when responding so your time is spent on issues that will be helpful to reviewers.  Respondents may consider areas not explicitly asked for if they feel the information provides useful guidance for AFNWCA.  In addition, we are requesting descriptions of trends that AFNWCA should be aware of as we prepare for these experiments.

We request information on relevant information technology standards and life sciences research specific standards.  Where multiple standards for an entity are important, respondents are asked to compare significant differences among them.  It is also important to identify problems with current standards that prevent their acceptance or cause problems in their implementation.  This RFI also requests information on standards bodies with which AFNWCA could cooperate productively.  Specifically, the AFNWCA wishes to gain insight on the possible relationship between any current experiments and possible future experiments in these areas.

We request information on significant laws or regulations that could have an impact upon the technology being adopted for standardization in life sciences research.  These include contractual and licensing agreements, as well as specific laws and regulations.

Organizations responding to this RFI shall designate a single contact within that organization for receipt of all subsequent communication regarding this RFI and any forthcoming RFPs.  The name of this contact will be made available to all AFNWCA staff.

Responses to this RFI must be received at AFNWCA no later than 5:00 PM US Mountain Time September 20, 2004. (See below for more details on receipt dates and addresses).  However, earlier responses are encouraged.  Responses received by September 20, 2004 will be given preliminary review at the October 2004 AFNWCA meeting.  Documentation submitted in response to this RFI will be available to all AFNWCA staff.

The following outline is offered to assist in the development of your response. You should include:

·	A cover letter -- the cover letter should include a brief summary of your response such as indicating which areas you are responding to and indicate if supporting documentation is included in your response.
·	Your response to any or all of the areas of information requested by this RFI.
·	If required, a glossary that maps terminology used in your response to Air Force standard terminology. 

Although the AFNWCA does not limit the size of responses, you are asked to consider that the AFNWCA will rely upon resources with limited time availability to review these responses.  In order to assure that your response receives the attention it deserves, you are asked to consider limiting the size of your response (not counting any supporting documentation) to approximately 10 pages.  If you consider supporting documentation to be necessary, please indicate which portions of the supporting documentation are relevant to this RFI.

All communication, including telephone clarifications, regarding this RFI, including submissions, should also be sent to the contact below.

The contractor shall continue to maintain or permit the Government to maintain an archive of the lighting data throughout the duration of this contract.  The contractor must currently have an established and operational network providing lighting data for the previously mentioned geographical areas.

The contractor will provide the management of the field crews and expertise on the best way to collect and clean each species of seed.  The collector will first check the seed using standard field methods to be sure that it has the potential for being viable (i.e. current year's seed, not dried and shriveled seed from previous years).  Bid should be made based on hand collection of seed.  Mechanical collection may be allowed during the actual collection, but will be discussed and approved on a location by location and species by species basis.  After the seed is collected, the collector will submit the seed to a seed-testing lab specified by COR for a TZ potential germination test.  All seed testing lab results will be submitted to the COR. This contract will be awarded based on the average price (Using the Friedmann Statistical Test) of 21 potential native plant species for collection (This is not the entire list of what will be collected under this contract).  Prices of seed not shown on this list will be negotiated at the time of request. A.  Commercially grown-out seed is not acceptable under this contract.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

				Washington, D.C. 20593

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) No. 481039. These solicitation clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27. The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code for this acquisition is 8733 and the North American Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to NimbleGen Systems to provide proprietary maskless array synthesis (MAS) for a customized high-density chip delivery for 12-plex arrays for an enteric viruses project. The following FAR Clauses shall apply to this solicitation: 52.212 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 52.214-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; and 52.232-33 Electronic Funds Transfers. All responsible sources that can provide and meet the above requirements shall submit written quotations by the due date referenced above. The award is being issued on a sole source basis because 1) NimbleGen Systems’ proprietery manufacturing process gives NimbleGen the ability to redesign each individual array as necessary and allows us to ultimately create an optimized enteric virus screening array;  NimbleGen provides high-density oligo arrays with flexible design capabilities on a chip-per-chip basis. 2) Nimblegen is the sole-soure provider of multi-well, high-density microarrays (12-well, 4-well, and single-well) that provides the ability to screen multiple independent samples in parallel on a single chip. This option is an absolute necessity for our research as it provides us the ability to conveniently screen many more biological samples than would be possible without this multi-well option. 3) NimbleGen has microscope slides that make their arrays compatible with our microarray scanning equipment, the Axon 4000B microarray scanner.  All questions should be submitted in writing via e-mail to TONEILL@OC.FDA.GOV or fax to 301-827-7101. FAR provisions can be found at the following website: http://www/arnet.gov.

Evaluation:  

The Contracting Officer will evaluate quotes on a technical acceptability and price basis, the basis of which consists of technical (capability of the items offered to meet the agency need as listed in the SOW) and price.  The selection of a contractor for award will be based on the specification strength and quality in the area of the offeror’s technical proposal.  Offerors shall include a detailed product description that highlights specifications and quality.  The technical quote will be significantly more important than price.  The Government intends to make a single award for CLIN 0001.
 
It is the Government’s intent to award to an offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the combined synopsis/solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors to represent the best value to the Government.  Offerors are cautioned that unsupported promises to comply with the RFQ requirements will not be sufficient.  Quotes must provide convincing documentary evidence in support of any conclusionary statements relating to promised performance.  

Offerors should provide references for a minimum of three of the offeror’s customers (contracts and/or subcontracts) for items of same or similar scope.  Projects cited and past performance references should be recent (within the last 3 years of the date of the quote).  The references should be limited to a brief description of the service provided, together with client points of contact (NOTE:  Include E-mail address and phone number for references!).  

Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services during the past three years.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The offeror’s record of past performance, or the lack thereof, will be an important factor in the assessment of the risk involved in the offeror’s quote.  

Delivery:  

Offerors are directed to FAR 52.211-9 on how they will be able to comply with the delivery requirements as follows:  

52.211-9 Desired and Required Time of Delivery.  DESIRED AND REQUIRED TIME OF DELIVERY (JUNE 1997)   

(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule.  DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No: CLIN 0001; Quantity:  6 each; 150 DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  
 
If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below.  However, the offeror’s proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government’s required delivery schedule as follows:  

REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No.:  CLIN 0001; Quantity:  6 each; 180 DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.  If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.  

OFFEROR’S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - Item No.: 0001; Quantity: 6 each; WITHIN _______ DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT.  

(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract.  The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated.  Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.)  If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.  (End of clause)  

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.216-1, Type of Contract, the Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price contract.  Acceptance will be by the Port of Umm Qasser, Iraq.  

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.212-2 Evaluation – Commercial Items, offerors should submit with their quotation:  (1) a price proposal which shows the proposed unit price for each line item, the extended total price for each line item, and the total overall price for all contract line items; (2) supporting information or product literature/specifications for the proposed items that demonstrates a clear understanding of the specifications stated in the SOW but not exceeding the clause at 52.212-1; (3) a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items (MAY 2002), and Alternate I (APR 2002); (4) Contractor’s Duns and Bradstreet (DUNS) number; (5) Contractor’s Cage Code; and (6) an affirmation that it has an active registration on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), which is at the website www.ccr.gov.

ANIMALS THAT RELIABLY RETURN TO A KNOWN LOCATION AND/OR ARE EASILY CAPTURED ARE OFTEN INSTRUMENTED WITH A DEVICE THAT ARCHIVES DATA ONBOARD AND CAN ONLY BE RETRIEVED AFTER THE ANIMAL HAS BEEN RECAPTURED, THE INSTRUMENT REMOVED, AND THE DATA DOWNLOADED.  ARCTIC ICE SEALS LIVE ON FREE-FLOATING PACK-ICE, ARE DIFFICULT TO CAPTURE, AND RARELY RETURN TO THE SAME LOCATION.  IN LIEU OF PHYSICAL RECOVERY, ICE SEALS MUST BE INSTRUMENTED WITH A DEVICE THAT PERIODICALLY TRANSMITS COLLECTED DATA TO AN ORBITING SATELLITE.  SUCH INSTRUMENTS ARE COLLECTIVELY CALLED SATELLITE TAGS.  THE ARCTIC ICE SEAL RESEARCH REQUIRES THE USE OF SATELLITE TAGS WITH CERTAIN SPECIFICATIONS.  THE SATELLITE TAGS MUST BE ABLE TO SAMPLE DEPTH EVERY TEN SECONDS, OPERATE TO A MAXIMAL DEPTH OF 1000 METERS, AND TRANSMIT ONLY WHEN THE ANTENNA IS CLEAR OF WATER (USING A CONDUCTIVITY SENSOR TO DETERMINE IF THE INSTRUMENT IS SUBMERGED).  THE TRANSMISSIONS MUST BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE ARGOS SATELLITE SYSTEM.  TRANSMISSIONS MUST INLCUDE STATUS MESSAGES FOR BATTERY VOLTAGE, THE NUMBER OF TRANSMISSIONS SENT, THE CURRENT ZERO-PRESSURE OFFSET VALUE, THE CURRENT TIME ACCORDING TO THE INTERNAL CLOCK, SEAWATER CONDUCTIVITY, AND THE MAXIMAL DEPTH READING OVER THE LAST TWENTY-FOUR HOURS.  THE SATELLITE TAGS MUST BE PROGRAMMABLE AND ALLOW THE USER TO DEFINE SEVERAL ASPECTS OF DATA COLLECTION AND TRANSMISSION.  DIVING DATA SHOULD BE COMPILED IN SIX-HOUR SAMPLING PERIODS IN THE COMPRESSIED HISTOGRAM, FORMAT COMMONLY USED IN MARINE MAMMAL RESEARCH.  NMML REQUIRES THAT THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HISTOGRAMS BE AVAILABLE:  MAXIMUM-DEPTH OF DIVES (DEPTH HISTOGRAM); DIVE DURATIONS (DURATION HISTOGRAM), AND TIME SPENT WTIHIN A SPECIFIED DEPTH RANGE (TIME-AT-DEPTH HISTOGRAM).  DEPTH AND DURATION RANGES FOR THESE HISTOGRAMS MUST BE PROGRAMMABLE.  THE SATELLITE TAGS SHOULD BE CONFIGURED WITH ENOUGH BATTERY POWER TO PROVIDE FOR APPROXIMATELY 25,000 TRANSMISSIONS.  TO PROLONG THE OPERATIONAL LIFE OF THE SATELLITE TAGS, DATA TRANSMISSION FREQUENCY SHOULD BE PROGRAMMABLE.  FOR EXAMPLE, NMML MAY REQUIRE TRANSMISSIONS TO BE SUSPENDED AFTER AN ANIMAL HAS BEEN ASHORE FOR SEVERAL HOURS AND, PRESUMABLY, ANY RECENT DATA HAS BEEN TRANSMITTED SUCCESSFULLY TO ARGOS SATELLITES.  NMML MAY ALSO REQUIRE A CHANGE IN THE FREQUENCY OF THE TRANSMISSIONS BASED ON THE LIKELY POSITION OF ORBITING SATELLITES AT VARIOUS TIMES OF THE DAY OR ACCORDING TO SOME OTHER DUTY CYCLE.  NMML REQUIRES WILDLIFE COMPUTERS BRAND “SPLASH” TAGS.  THE RESEARCH GOALS REQUIRE VERY SPECIFIC FEATURES TO BE INCLUDED IN THE DATA RECORDERS.  ONLY THE SATELLITE-LINKED DATA RECORDERS MADE BY WILDLIFE COMPUTERS INCLUDE ALL OF THE NECESSARY SPECIALIZED FEATURES IN ONE UNIT.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, THESE TAGS ARE SIMILAR IN DESIGN AND FUNCTION TO SATELLITE TAGS USED IN PREVIOUS AND ONGOING STUDIES AT NMML.  QUANTITY TWENTY-FIVE (25) TAGS TO BE DELIVERED NO LATER THAN 3/31/05.  THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION WITH AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF LESS THAN $100,000.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS ADMENDMENT IS TO EXTEND THE RESPONSE DATE FROM AUGUST 17, 2004 UNTIL AUGUST 24, 2004, TO ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT ADDITIONAL TIME TO PREPARE THE RESPONSE TO TECHNICAL QUESTIONS.


Statement of Work for – Assessment of DOC Compliance Program


The Department of Commerce has a requirement to provide the Agreements Compliance unit is seeking proposals for issuing a questionnaire, hosting focus groups, and/or conducting interviews to gather strategic feedback from core and target customers.  These surveys will provide reactions to MAC’s publicly available tools, informational outreach efforts, customer service regarding compliance casework, and new initiatives for exporters.

Background

In 2003, the Department of Commerce’s (DOC’s) International Trade Administration (ITA) conducted a bureau-wide Customer Satisfaction Survey covering all ITA program units.  ITA’s Market Access and Compliance (MAC) program survey report identified gaps between a high level of customer awareness yet low customer use of fair trade and market access services.  Findings also indicate that a substantial customer base is unaware of the specific services that the DOC Compliance Program offers.

In response to the survey findings, MAC is proposing to conduct a survey and/or focus groups to assess, in more specific terms and greater detail, what is MAC’s Trade Compliance Center’s (TCC’s) customers expectations.  This will enable the TCC to answer: “What Do Customers Want from the DOC’s Compliance Program?”   Information about the TCC can be found on its website at www.export.gov/tcc. 


Work Description

The Department of Commerce’s (DOC) International Trade Administration (ITA) has made great strides in monitoring ITA’s customer satisfaction and advancing a strategic approach to delivering value to its customers.  

The purpose of this Work is to obtain customer and potential customer views regarding the DOC Compliance Program to determine:
 
&#61553;	If the TCC offers the right set of services to assist U.S. exporters to overcome foreign trade barriers
 

&#61553;	If MAC is aware of exporter needs
&#61553;	If the right MAC programs are in place to meet identified needs
&#61553;	If MAC services are properly promoted to maximize efficiency and effectiveness
	
	In order to continue to monitor customer satisfaction and improve the customer experience, this work requires the following deliverables:
	
 

•	Design and administer a MAC survey based on the TCC-relevant recommendations identified during the ITA-wide Customer Satisfaction Survey
•	Development of an interview guide and conduct focus groups and/or interviews to obtain additional information regarding the survey findings and address the desired outcomes
•	Analysis and recommendations based on survey and focus group questions that address the following key issues
	
	The primary scope and outcomes from this work include the following:
 

&#61553;	Analysis of what ‘customers’ expect of Commerce compliance services and how expectations match ability of the TCC to deliver those services 
&#61553;	Recommendations on how to improve customer awareness and use of products and services (what tools & how are they used)
 

&#61553;	Identification of opportunities to increase Market Access and Compliance case intake
 

&#61553;	Identification of which monitoring and outreach tools work best and which could be improved or added (best distribution/communication channels)
&#61553;	Identification of data for areas of client demand where product or services are needed but do not exist
 

&#61553;	Analysis of customer perceptions about resolving foreign trade barriers
 

&#61553;	Analysis of what prevents potential customers from using Commerce Compliance Program services
 

&#61553;	Assessment of how well the Liaison subprogram is delivering value
 

	
	Alternatives 
	
	Market Access and Compliance is considering the two options below and requests a proposal outlining the approach, activities, and timing for executing a survey and/or focus group that will target the following customer segments:
	
 

a.	 Active customers: Existing TCC customers who will be able to comment on the effectiveness of MAC’s current programs, identify repeat business opportunities, and suggest potential improvements
b.	 Prospective customers: Exporters who are aware of the TCC, but currently do not seek assistance and will be able to provide insight regarding what would motivate them to use the TCC’s programs
c.	 Untapped customers: Exporters who are unaware of the TCC’s products and services and will be able to provide insight regarding how the TCC can best increase its customer base through awareness and promotional efforts 
	
	Option 1.  Conduct a Customer Survey and Focus Groups to Assess the Effectiveness of the Compliance Program – The contractor shall provide an outline of the specific tasks involved in administering a survey and series of focus groups/interviews, including questionnaire development, design, approval, and execution.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)

6 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The Government of Afghanistan is planning to create a National Institute of Standards, whose purpose will be to establish standards for product and service quality and safety.  In order to promote trade and private sector investment in Afghanistan, standards must be established and enforced.  Afghanistan has become a dumping ground for poor quality products due to the lack of standards, inadequate import and customs control, and the low purchasing power of Afghan consumers.  The Minister of Commerce has spearheaded efforts to establish a National Institute of Standards in Afghanistan.  However, due to the lack of qualified personnel in Afghanistan, it is extremely difficult to formulate a comprehensive plan.  Therefore the Government of Afghanistan has requested USTDA assistance to develop a standards program plan and separately to support training for the employees of this soon-to-be-established Institute.

The standards program plan would initially focus on the food, pharmaceuticals, construction materials and petroleum industries.  The establishment of standards and norms would require product testing and evaluation laboratories.  The National Institute of Standards would run the laboratories and conduct the testing, administration, and enforcement of national standards.  The equipment required to outfit the laboratories is estimated to cost $1.5 million.    

The DM consultant will meet with officials, including U.S. Embassy officials, in Afghanistan and the U.S. to discuss the needs and concept for the National Institute of Standards of Afghanistan.  The DM Consultant will spend approximately two weeks in Afghanistan reviewing the proposed project, finalizing a training program, and delivering the training program to the staff of the future National Institute of Standards.  The DM consultant will write Terms of Reference and budgets for any technical assistance projects that meet USTDA criteria.  The DM will meet with officials from the multilateral development banks, as well as private sector banks and relevant government officials, to discuss available financing for this project.
