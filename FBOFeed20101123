<DESC><p>MSC will be issuing a Request for Quotations (RFQ)&nbsp;for the following services:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Background</p>
<p>MSC is investigating the elimination of various obsolete Sound Powered Telephone Circuits, voice amplified circuits and other Internal Communication Circuits on the T-ARS Class vessels. The intent is to remove those systems that are no longer needed using TRANSALT instructions that pertain to all four ships of the class. Obvious obsolete systems include the Light Machine Gun Circuit, the Captain's Battle Circuit, and the remnants of a Voice Tube System. Removal of these systems will provide much needed space for habitability improvements as well as the anticipated increases in cable space for future system upgrades, such as the new Machinery Control System (MCCS) project. Particular attention is being focused on the main deck area, port side, frames 27 through 40, where extensive changes to crew staterooms are planned for improved habitability. This research will also document the SP circuits required by ABS, USCG, and MSC/MSFSC Instructions and Regulations.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions (OA), Station Support Simplified Acquisitions Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate, on a non-competitive basis, with and issue a purchase order to Gianluca Ursini, MD, Psychiatric Neuroscience Group, Department of Neurological and Psychiatric Sciences, University of Bari, Piazza G. Cesare, 11, 70124 - Bari, Italy, for neuropsychological evaluation service. The acquisition is being processed under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).&nbsp; The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business standard is $7.0 million.<br /><br />This acquisition is a fee-for-service type and the work is to be performed at the University of Bari, Bari, Italy. The period of performance is to be one year from the date of award on or around December 10, 2010.<br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to procure professional service to support the NIMH, Clinical Brain Disorders Branch-Genes, Cognition and Psychosis Program's (CBDB-GCAP) Schizophrenia Trios Study in Italy. The purpose of the study is to identify genes that may increase the risk for developing schizophrenia. The CBDB-GCAP researchers discovered such genes by first collecting DNA samples from a large number of patients with schizophrenia, two parents, and siblings. The biological samples collected will be used to isolate DNA and create cell lines that will be used to genotype markers in specific candidate genes and chromosomal regions. Well-established working memory paradigms that have been shown to be functionally associated with specific gene variants and increased genetic risk will be used as quantitative measures.<br /><br />Thie proposed vendor will be in charge of contacting patients already diagnosed with schizophrenia and their parents. Patients will be recruited among the ones admitted to the outpatient and inpatient clinics at the Department of Neurological and Psychiatric Sciences, University of Bari, in Bari, Italy. Subjects will be informed about the project, its risks and advantages. Appraisal of their interest and willingness to participate in the project will be assessed. The selected families will then be contacted again and asked to definitively confirm their willingness to participate in the project. Additional contact will be made in order to determine participant eligibility.&nbsp; Some of the participants, though fulfilling these initial screening criteria, will receive none of these diagnoses during the SCID for DSM-IV interviews and will therefore be excluded from the study. &nbsp;Informed consent for all procedures will be asked from all patients with schizophrenia and their parents prior to data collection. Subjects' capacity to give informed consent will be initially screened during the selection process.&nbsp; If capacity to give informed consent is uncertain, a research psychiatrist will be consulted who will interview the patient and family members to make the determination of patients' competency.<br /><br />The proposed vendor, Dr. Ursini, is an experienced psychiatrist, who worked as an independent contractor on the schizophrenia study (95-M-0150) from January 2009 through April 2010. &nbsp;He was trained to conduct this study under his mentor, Dr. Alessandro Bertolino, who was a former Fellow in the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch at the NIMH where he, himself was trained and worked on the study 95-M-0150 as well. &nbsp;To perform the requirement the candidate must be on staff at the Department of Neurological and Psychiatric Sciences, University of Bari in Bari, Italy as a psychiatrist or psychologist and must have special training to conduct CBDB/ GCAP Trios Study modified psychiatric interviews as required to fulfill research study inclusionary /exclusionary criteria. &nbsp;Therefore, it is determined that Dr. Ursini, is the only known and qualified source to perform the requirement.

<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Aging (NIA), intends to negotiate, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, on a noncompetitive, sole source basis, with Charles River Laboratories located in Massachusetts, for the Development and Maintenance of a Long-Term Colony of Calorically Restricted Rodents. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources may express their interest by submitting a capability statement or proposal. All capability statement/proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This effort will be for four years.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND <br />The objective is to continue to maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged, genetically defined, calorically restricted rodents for use by investigators in studies of aging. This colony was initially developed and maintained within controlled barrier environments where the environmental conditions are defined and the animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity.<br />Caloric restriction, in which the calories are restricted to maintain a stable adult body weight but all other nutritional needs are met, is the only proven intervention to extend lifespan and improve health. Calorically restricted rodents are used to investigate the cellular and physiological biology of normal aging. A colony of aged, calorically restricted laboratory rodents, of defined genetic backgrounds and health status, is an integral part of the NIA's program of research on aging.</p>
<p>The animals are housed in barriers to prevent contamination of the colony with disease organisms that would negatively impact the research for which the animals are provided. Precautions include filtering of the air going into the barriers, positive pressure in the barrier rooms to prevent mixing of air between barriers, requirements for staff to shower in and out of the barriers, and sterilization of all materials going into the barriers. No animals are returned to the barriers after leaving the barriers. For these reasons, the existing colony cannot be transferred to a new Contractor.</p>
<p>Environmental requirements to protect the colony from contamination prevent the transfer of the colony to a new contractor. As it would take 2-3 years to restart the colony from the beginning, re-deriving new foundation stock and building up the breeding colony to sufficient size to provide the requisite entry levels into the caloric restricted colony, an offeror must detail a similar colony available for NIA utilization. <br />The Statement of Work consists of these major phases: A. Breeding Colony Development; B. Breeding Colony Maintenance; C. Maintenance of the Aging Caloric Restriction Colony; D. Feeding Protocol; E. Environmental Requirements; F. Colony Evaluation and Monitoring, G. Shipment of Animals to Investigators; H. Cost of Animals to Investigators; and I. Reporting Requirements;</p>
<p>I. Breeding Colony Development</p>
<p>The Contractor shall acquire at the direction of the Project Officer breeding stock and shall re-derive the stock by cesarean section or embryo transfer. The Contractor shall provide to the Project Officer documentation of the re-derivation and genetic history of the foundation stock for the aging colony. Foster mothers shall be of a strain that is easily distinguished from the NIA strains by both color and genetic markers.</p>
<p>II. Breeding Colony Maintenance</p>
<p>Re-derived foundation colony animals shall be entered into the barriers without contamination by pathogens or parasites and shall be maintained as such. Discrete space shall be provided for the breeding and aging colonies within each barrier. Breeding colony animals shall be removed from the barrier only for monitoring of genetic purity or colony health, or for other purposes as directed by the Project Officer. In both colony segments, no animals other than mice and rats shall be housed within the barrier and no other types of activity other than colony breeding and maintenance shall be permitted in the barrier rooms used to breed and maintain the NIA colony. Breeding and maintenance of commercial colonies of mice and rats is permissible within the barrier rooms housing the NIA colonies, but activities such as surgery or euthanasia are not permissible within the same rooms as the NIA colonies. Breeding colony maintenance shall conform to the following requirements.</p>
<p>III. Maintenance of the Aging Caloric Restriction Colony</p>
<p>A. Rodents shall be weaned at 3 - 4 weeks of age and shall be permanently marked by tail tattoo to identify month and year of birth. Animals born in excess of the number required to meet defined levels of entry into the aging colony shall be euthanized unless otherwise directed by the Project Officer.</p>
<p>B. Weaned rodents shall be housed individually and fed ad libitum until the commencement of the caloric restriction regimen. Caging must meet current ILAR and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm) standards. Cage cards shall include the strain, gender, feeding protocol (AL or CR when assigned), and date of birth.</p>
<p>IV. Feeding Protocol</p>
<p>A. Ad libitum (AL) fed animals assigned to the aging colony shall receive a laboratory animal feed, the formulation of which is consistent with NIH31 autoclavable diet with regard to ingredients, both in kind and amount. The kind of ingredient shall be absolute; the percentage of the kinds of ingredients may vary dependent on nutrient content, provided the final formulation post-autoclaving remains consistent with NIH31 diet. NIH31 shall be made in random weight pellets appropriate for feeding mice and rats.</p>
<p>B. Calorically restricted (CR) animals shall receive a laboratory animal feed, the formulation of which is consistent with NIH31 autoclavable diet but is enriched 1.67-fold for all vitamins and minerals such that 40% restricted calorie intake provides 100% of the vitamin and mineral intake of ad libitum fed animals. This diet is called NIH31-Fortified. NIH31-Fortified shall be provided in known-weight pellets from 2.5 to 5.0 grams in 0.5 gram increments. The diet shall be of a consistency that prevents excessive crumbling of the pellets.</p>
<p>C. The Contractor shall measure food intake in the first cohort (DOB) of each strain and gender entered into the aging colony, to verify that food intake in the new colony is consistent with the levels on which the feeding protocol is based. Food intake shall be measured by providing an excess number of food pellets of known weight each day and weighing the food remaining the next day. Food intake shall be measured daily for the entire cohort from the age of 5 weeks through the age of 12 weeks. The data shall be compiled in an Excel spreadsheet and the up-dated spreadsheet shall be provided to the Project Officer weekly.</p>
<p>V. Environmental Requirements</p>
<p>A. The Contractor shall provide discrete production space for each colony segment within the barrier or isolation area for that segment. This space shall be defined within each unit, and the animals held therein until the scheduled removal or expiration of the animals. Facilities set aside for these colonies shall be provided with all equipment, materials, and supplies necessary to maintain these animals effectively within the barrier enclosure in a stable condition and environment.</p>
<p>VI. Colony Evaluation and Monitoring</p>
<p>A. All spontaneous deaths in the colony shall be reported by barrier, gender, diet and age in the semiannual progress reports and on the weekly census report. Necropsies shall not be performed unless there is an unusual pattern of animal deaths or upon the direction of the Project Officer. Postmortem findings in such cases shall be tabulated, summarized, and provided to the Project Officer within sixty (60) calendar days of the death. Primary and secondary lesions possibly attributable to cause of death are to be described. Differences between colony segments shall be identified and reported in the semiannual progress report.</p>
<p>B. Routine monitoring for disease and post mortem examinations is to be performed by either an independent laboratory approved by the Project Officer or the Contractor if Contractor plans, personnel and facilities are approved by the Project Officer. <br />C. The Contractor shall provide for positive assurance of genetic quality control, by micro-satellite testing of a sample of the breeding colonies to detect genetic contamination.</p>
<p>VII. Reporting Requirements</p>
<p>A. Semiannual progress reports shall include any unusual developments or problems involving colony health, genetic purity, environment or environmental control, and any differences noted between barriers. The report shall include the results of routine genetic monitoring and all laboratory tests executed either by Contractor as a routine part of the protocol or results from tests that have direct implication for colony health or development. All deaths or sacrifices from the colony shall be accounted for by barrier, gender, diet and age of the animal sacrificed or expired. Unusual problems shall be reported to the Project Officer immediately. Semiannual progress reports shall be submitted to the Project Officer within fifteen (15) calendar days of the end of each six-month period of the contract. The initial report shall be submitted for the first full six months of the contract performance including any fractional part of the initial month. Thereafter, the reporting period shall consist of six full calendar months. A semiannual report will not be required for the period when the final report is due.</p>
<p>B. A weekly census report, A weekly up-date of the food intake measurements during the initiation of the aging colony and a complete quarterly health monitoring reports shall be submitted to the Project Officer.</p>
<p>This proposed acquisition was previously publicized under sources sought notices HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RFP-11-146.<br />The estimated contract award date will be on or about June 1, 2011. <br />This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) intends to solicit and negotiate, on a sole source basis, a modification to an existing delivery order placed under an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with the Bell Boeing Joint Project Office (BB JPO) located in Amarillo, TX under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The United States Marine Corps (USMC) has identified a requirement for two (2) MV-22 Containerized Flight Training Devices (CFTDs) to be delivered to Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Futenma, Japan to support the USMC's transition from legacy rotor-wing aircraft to MV-22 aircraft. The required delivery date of the two (2) MV-22 CFTDs to support this transition is October 2012. Under the existing ID/IQ contract (N61339-08-D-0004-0002), from which MV-22 CFTD Serial Number 2F-200-002 through 2F-200-006 were procured, the contractor will deliver a training system Re-Procurement Data Package (RPDP). The RPDP is scheduled to be delivered by March of 2011, and the Government estimates that it would be available for competition by June 2011. In the Government's estimation, this would not satisfy the USMC need date of October 2012. The anticipated ceiling amount for this contract action is $24.5M. The additional supplies to be procured under this ID/IQ contract include the acquisition of the following: two USMC (MV-22) CFTDs, Serial Numbers 2F200-007 and 2F200-008; the associated technical data, the provisioned items and spares required to implement the life-cycle sustainment of the fielded MV-22 CFTD Training Systems. A sources sought notice, N61339-10-MVCFTDs78, was published on 20 September 2010. No responses were received that indicated that there exists any other capability within the training system industry base to satisfy the Government's stated requirement.
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested sources desiring to contest this synopsis may do so by asserting its supportable rationale via email to Erin Barton, erin.barton@navy.mil in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2003, no later than 23 December 2010 at 1300 EST. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. No solicitation document is available. If no written contest to this synopsis is received, a Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) in accordance with FAR Part 6.303 based on the rationale provided above will be initiated. If conducted as a sole source procurement with BB JPO, no further synopsis will be provided.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>The World War II Memorial Registry Kiosks</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) is responsible for four kiosks at the World War II Memorial visitor center in Washington D.C.<span>&nbsp; </span>These kiosks are located on the eastern face of the visitor center and are exposed to the morning sun.<span>&nbsp; </span>The kiosks provide the visitor access to the registry that was established by ABMC as a part of the memorial.<span>&nbsp; </span>The exposure of the kiosks causes operational problems.<span>&nbsp; </span>The glare from the bright light makes it difficult to read the screens and the heat from the sun often causes the exposed portion of the screen to turn black.<span>&nbsp; </span>ABMC is seeking to resolve these problems at the kiosks and is seeking information from industry on what technical solutions may be available.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The current kiosks are installed in a secure enclosure and consist of a 17&rdquo; infrared touch screen on a 17&rdquo; Hi-Bright LCD monitor.<span>&nbsp; </span>The screen is controlled by a Dell Vostro workstation, which has network access.<span>&nbsp; </span>The workstation&rsquo;s operating system is Microsoft Windows 7 running a kiosk application security wrapper and Microsoft SQL server.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The solution that ABMC seeks would assume that the Eastern orientation of the kiosks would remain, and that the kiosks remain 508 compliant.<span>&nbsp; </span>A color display and a touch screen are also desirable.<span>&nbsp; </span>The solution would also require relatively low amounts of maintenance, be capable of continuous operations, be robust and have low failure rates.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Internet version of the World War II registry can be found at <a href="http://www.wwiimemorial.com/default.asp?page=registry.asp&amp;subpage=search">http://www.wwiimemorial.com/default.asp?page=registry.asp&amp;subpage=search</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Interested parties are requested to provide not more than 5 pages of narrative that describes your general solution to our problem and not more than 2 pages of narrative of references you have where you have solved a similar problem.<span>&nbsp; </span>References should include a point of contact (POC) and a phone number for each POC.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Please contact Mr. Tom Sole at 703-696-6899 or via email at <a href="mailto:solet@abmc.gov">solet@abmc.gov</a> .<span>&nbsp; </span>Responses are due on or before December 20, 2010 to Mr. Sole at the email address previously listed.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">By way of this Notice and in accordance with the provisions of FAR 6.302-2, the Chicago District, US Army Corps of Engineers, announces its intention to award a sole source contract to Smith Root Incorporated (SRI) of Vancouver, Washington, for the purpose of acquiring a permanent EMF Shield System for the Dispersal Barrier IIA and the Demo Barrier at the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal Aquatic Nuisance Species Electric Dispersal Barrier Project Site in Romeoville, Illinois. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri">The work will involve the configuration, testing and installation of an EMF shielding system that will lower measured EMF emissions to not more than 100% of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNRIP) exposure standard at a distance of 12 inches from the raceway bus bars under conditions where the pulsers are operating at maximum anticipated current flow (Approximately 8500A).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; This&nbsp;</span>Shielding system must be easily disassembled to allow for barrier maintenance and retain shielding capabilities upon reassembly and the installation of the shielding system must be performed while the Demonstration and 2A Barriers are in inoper</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">able (shutdown) mode during the Winter</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri"> maintenance period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Under a&nbsp;previously awarded sole source contract to SRI, this District acquired the supply and installation&nbsp;of pulse generator devices, which were customized and&nbsp;considered the only ones of its type capable of meeting the demands of the Dispersal Barrier technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All intellectual property rights pertaining to these unique components belong exclusively to SRI, including, but not limited to copyrights, patents and trademarks which are expressly reserved to SRI and covered by their Patent 4750451. Further, SRI has research, proprietary arts, trade secret technology not open to the public that they use in fish barrier designs and components therein; thereby making SRI the only source capable of satisfying the government's requirements of this proposed contract. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">SRI has the technical expertise and intimate knowledge required to successfully configure an EMF Shielding System for the Dispersal Barrier IIA and the Demo Barrier, as it possesses the knowledge/technology necessary to detect possible changes in the electric engineering parameters (e.g., operating voltage and amperage, pulse width and pulse repetition frequency) for EMF dispersal barriers and resulting changes in barrier performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, it has expert knowledge of shielding systems and access to theoretical/empirical electric engineering data and related methodology to address changes to ensure proper barrier performance; it has clear and complete understanding of the requirements for shielding assembly/disassembly for proper barrier maintenance; and knowledge of the potential for heating (e.g., from eddy currents in shielding) to affect barrier performance and the resulting need for ventilation or other procedures to mitigate these possible affects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">To further add, the assembly (customization) and installation of this system will require the use of SRI's uniquely skilled and highly reliable labor force, already having the immense knowledge of the Barrier's mechanical and electronic systems. This skilled labor force of </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">SRI&nbsp;provided&nbsp;an EMF shielding for this District's<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Dispersal Barrier IIA Building.&nbsp;Its labor force demonstrated a comprehensive understanding and the capabilities necessary to properly assemble their patented components, and remain on schedule to meet the critical timeframes imposed by the tight overall project schedule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The award of this proposed fixed price services contract is critical to execute the mission for the Fish Barrier project. Therefore, the government cannot afford any delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements since the Barrier itself protects the ecosystem from two species of Asian carp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The massive and voracious fish, which can grow to 4 feet long and weigh 100 pounds, are known for their ability to leap up to 8 feet out of the water as motor boats speed by, injuring fishermen. Scientists fear that the fish, which can eat the equivalent of 40 percent of their body weight every day, could damage the ecosystem of the Great Lakes, which is the largest fresh water system on earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><span style="COLOR: black">n this regard, it is deemed necessary to obtain these services&nbsp;from&nbsp;SRI to continue an agile operation of the Barrier without disruption and to avoid a substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered by way of competition.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">It is important to note that under the proposed contract, all work including system testing must be completed by January 21, 2011 and the O&amp;M Manual and Management Personnel Training and Shielding System Operator's Training will be required to be completed by March 31, 2011. </span></p>

<DESC>The U.S. Air Force Global Positioning Systems Directorate intends to procure spare parts for SV1-2 and reprice long lead parts for SV5 under the existing GPS Block IIIA contract. (Although the contract, as awarded, included pricing for long lead parts for SV5 and 6, the contract must now be restructured to permit the Directorate to acquire long lead parts for SV5 separate from those needed for SV6.) These parts include, but are not limited to, attitude control system assemblies, UHF receive cylinders, pyro cartridges, relays, battery cells, solar array yokes/booms, circuit card assemblies, transistors, transformers, plexers, crystal oscillators, atomic frequency standards, feed support panel, UHF beamforming network, cable cutters, diodes, solar array cells, propulsion tanks, inductors, single board computers, amplifiers, oscillators, antenna elements, hinges, solar array drive assemblies, capacitors, solar array substrates, transducers, on-board computer, integrated circuits, hybrids, filters and field programmable gate arrays. These parts must satisfy all requirements in the existing GPS IIIA contract (e.g., Technical Operating Reports 4430/4432) and be delivered to the Directorate not later than 23 December 2011 for SV1, 23 December 2011 for SV2 and 8 May 2016 for SV5.. Accordingly the Government intends to award a sole-source contract modification to Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, 100 Campus Drive, Newtown, PA 18940, as it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements (10 U.S.C. &sect; 2304(c)(1) &amp; (d)(1)(B)(ii). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 336414. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. <br />
<p><br />Statement of Capabilities</p>
<p>All responsible sources capable of meeting the Government's requirements detailed in this notice must submit a Statement of Capabilities and Qualifications Statement to the technical and contracting POCs listed below by 1700 PST on 9 December 2010. Responses are limited to five (5) 8.5" x 11" pages with 1" margins and 12 point font (Arial or Times New Roman ok) and number pages.</p>
<p>The capability and qualifications statement will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining the offeror's ability to meet the Government's needs described above. Consequently, the Government is primarily interested in responsible sources providing specific technical details indicating how that source can meet the Government's needs. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions. A determination not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis is solely within the discretion of the Government. Submit Statement of Capabilities electronically to francis.whalen@losangeles.af.mil and Barbara.baker@losangeles.af.mil , or Statements of Capabilities may be mailed to SMC/PK, Attn: Frank Whalen, 483 N. Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2808.</p>
<p>An ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate its concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition to the proper channels. The ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer, but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The ombudsman is Mr. James Gill (310) 653-1789. Questions pertaining to this announcement shall be directed to the Contracting Officer, Frank Whalen, SMC/PK at (310) 653-3397 or by email at francis.whalen@losangeles.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES (OCT 1997)  (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.  (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining information to serve as a market survey to aid in research associated with the potential development of a Micro Inertial Navigator (MINAV).  This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued pursuant to FAR 15.2. The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but desires information on risk, price, performance, pertinent research and/or products as well as other information related to planning the development of the MINAV system.  The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) Redstone Arsenal, AL, on behalf of the U.S. Army, desires to obtain information to serve as a market survey to aid in research associated with the development of a non-Global Positioning System (GPS), non-celestial Micro Inertial Navigator (MINAV).  Current navigation and azimuth sensing technology has placed a premium on accuracy and performance without excessive concerns regarding Size, Weight and Power (SWaP).  Typical systems range from 100 in3 to 400 in3, weigh 7.0 to 15 pounds and require 20 to 50 watts.  These systems are ideally suited for large-scale military platforms and commercial markets.  However, as weapon systems requirements increase in accuracy and performance an opposing trend has emerged in the form of overall size and power reductions.  Many weapon systems are now man-portable or remote/unmanned and with the advent of precise Global Positioning System (GPS) location, these systems either require an inertial/GPS blended solution or stand alone inertial back-up in the event of GPS denial.  To date, no significant SWaP advancements have been made in the core technology of navigation grade inertial sensor technology.  The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but desires information on risk, price, performance, pertinent research and/or products as well as other information related to planning the development of a non-GPS, non-celestial MINAV system.  As a result of issuing this RFI, the Government expects to receive technical, programmatic, Research and Development (R&D) methodologies to assist in the development of the following:  (a) Determine the ability of current and near term technology to support a MINAV system. (b) Identify potential sensor designs that have demonstrated the potential to meet the objectives stated below. (c) Determine the approximate cost for the potential MINAV R&D effort. (d) Establish a reasonable schedule for the potential effort.  Interested and capable sources are asked to present a briefing and/or submit a white paper addressing each of the areas of interest listed above.  If available, existing designs and data, simulated or real, from existing sensor designs should be included in the briefing and/or white paper.  The MINAV would contain six inertial sensors, three accelerometers and three gyroscopes, in a single package excluding electronics and power supply within a limited volume.  The MINAV threshold volume is 12 in3 and the objective volume is 4 in3.  This volume is allocated for the sensors only and does not include electronics or power supply for the MINAV.  It is however envisioned that the electronics for the MINAV will utilize appropriate fabrication and packaging techniques necessary to render a single electronics card capable of processing and outputting navigation data.  A summary of the performance guidelines is as follows:  Threshold (T), Objective (O)<BR>Volume:  12.0 in3 (T), 4.0 in3 (O)<BR>Weight:  20 ounces (1.25 pounds) (T), 8 ounces (0.5 pounds) (O)<BR>Power:  less than 5 watts (T), less than 1 watt (O)<BR>Alignment Time:  5.0 min. (T), 1.0 min. (O)<BR>Azimuth Error:  5.0 gmils* (T), 1.0 gmils* (O)<BR>Horizontal Position Error: 25m Circular Error Probable (CEP) (T), 5m CEP (O)<BR>Vertical Error: 10m Probable Error (PE) (T), 5m (PE) (O)<BR>Stored Heading Alignment Time:  2.0 min. (T), 30 sec. (O)<BR>Static Update Interval:  15 min. (T), 30 min. (O)<BR>Static Update Length:  60 sec. (T), 30 sec. (O)<BR>*gmils represents Gunners Mils which measure 6400 gmils per revolution.<BR>The primary goal of the RFI is to assess the feasibility of various approaches to micro-inertial navigation that possess the capability to meet the performance goals.  The size and weight goals are secondary behind (1) proving feasibility, performance and (2) identifying and mitigating risk associated with miniaturization.  The envisioned MINAV would be expected to leverage existing gyroscope and accelerometer sensor designs from the owning entity already in the design phase or in a larger prototype form.  It is desirable that material selection and fabrication techniques be considered for the purposes of maintaining the lowest possible costs, however alternate concepts are encouraged and will be considered.  The government encourages creativity and collaboration in response to this RFI.  All briefs and/or whitepapers should include the following: 1. A brief description of the fundamental core methodology; 2. A brief description of the proposed gyroscopes and accelerometers on which the MINAV is based; 3. A brief description of the materials and fabrication associated with the system; 4. An expected schedule and cost for the completion of the sensors; 5. An expected schedule and cost for the completion of the system; 6. A brief description of associated projects that the respondents company is or has been involved in that would be leveraged for the MINAV or are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI.  This should include any relevant lessons learned.  The objective of this process is to assess the feasibility of various approaches to micro-inertial navigation that possess the capability to meet the performance goals.  THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. Rather this Request for Information is part of a technology survey that is an integral part of US Army planning efforts for possible future programs. The US Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information, neither is the government liable for any costs associated with the preparation of this RFI.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Research Center is conducting a market survey/sources sought to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZONE small business capable of serving the needs mentioned below. This market survey/sources sought announcement is not a request for proposals and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research and the Government will not entertain questions concerning this market research. The Government will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this market survey.
<p>The Rehabilitation Medicine Department in the Clinical Research Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH-RMD) in Bethesda, Maryland has agreed to assist the Social Security Administration (SSA) explore innovative methods for augmenting the disability evaluation process. This requires assessment of individuals' functional abilities across a variety of domains in relationship to functional demands in the workplace and features of the workplace, home, and community environments. To meet this objective, the NIH-RMD, in conjunction with a contractor, will develop Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) instruments utilizing Item Response Theory (IRT) to assess a spectrum of human functioning domains. CAT represents a simple form of artificial intelligence software requiring computer technology for administration.</p>
<p>The scope of functional domains for CAT development includes: learning and applying knowledge, general tasks and demands, communication, mobility, self-care; and, interpersonal interactions and relationships. The mobility and interpersonal interactions and relationships domains are in progress; thus, up to four additional functional domains must be assessed for CAT instrument development. Rapid assessment methods are needed that are compatible with SSA processes and will yield easily interpretable results that can be efficiently and meaningfully integrated to provide accurate and uniform information about an individual's ability to engage in substantial gainful employment. The demonstrated advantages of the CAT instruments compared to more traditional testing methods are: reduced respondent burden, increased score precision, elimination of ceiling and floor effects, client-specific confidence intervals, monitoring of data quality in real time, and lower data collection costs. Because functional outcomes have been shown to have a clear hierarchical structure, gains in precision and efficiency of score estimation are superior to traditional fixed forms of functional assessment, thus transforming the ways in which outcomes can be monitored.</p>
<p>CAT tool development will require a calibration study for each instrument. A calibration study is a field study of item content and structure conducted with samples of respondents representing the intended users of the CAT instruments. Item pool development and subsequent item calibration are unique for each CAT tool and for the target population for which they are developed. To better support the SSA's evaluation process, distinct applicant and provider CAT instruments are being developed. Participant recruitment and telephone as well as internet test administration will be needed to conduct the CAT tool calibration studies. Sample sizes for most scientifically defensible CAT calibration projects are in the range of 500-700 respondents. This sample size is needed to support a series of confirmatory factor analyses and to perform statistical modeling. Inadequate sample size may lead to inaccurate and unstable statistical outcomes. Due to projected response rates for the recruitment of claimants and providers, the anticipated recruitment volume will require the contractor to provide evidence of established procedures and staffing to efficiently manage the recruitment effort.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the calibration studies, cut-points will need to be established along each disability domain scale, as measured by CAT. In addition, each newly developed CAT instrument must be validated with at least two existing assessment instruments. Developed CAT tools must be compatible with the stepwise nature of the SSA disability evaluation process and yield easily interpretable results that can be efficiently and meaningfully integrated to provide accurate, uniform, and rapid information about an individual's functional capacity necessary to engage in substantial gainful employment.</p>
<p>The contractor must demonstrate the following: <br />1) Knowledge of contemporary theoretical models of the disablement process and SSA disability evaluation processes as demonstrated by scholarly publications, participation in scientific forums as a content expert, and scientific committee participation in these areas<br />2) Senior investigators with published outcomes related to CAT tool development and the application of CAT technology utilizing item response theory <br />3) Success developing, testing, and implementing CAT modules in real world settings administered to individuals with a variety of limitations and those without limitations, and yielding immediate, interpretable results <br />4) Successful completion of calibration studies associated with CAT tool development in domains of human functioning <br />5) Understanding and adherence to ethical guidelines and regulatory requirements for research involving human subjects.<br />6) Technological capabilities to support all aspects of CAT development, implementation, and integration with SSA processes<br />7) Expected compliance with a mandated Federal background screening process and report of current Federal security clearances for senior project personnel, if applicable</p>
<p>CAT development will take place at the contractor's location, but the contractor will need to work closely with NIH-RMD and SSA staff via teleconferencing, electronic correspondence, and occasional face-to-face meetings at NIH and/or SSA to ensure that project objectives are met. NIH-RMD hopes to build on existing electronic CAT tools that have been developed to date and are relevant to this project that quantify key domains including movement and physical activities, basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and applied cognition.</p>
<p>The NIH-RMD seeks a contractor for a base period of twelve months, with three, twelve month unilateral options available to extend the term of services, who will develop, calibrate and validate CAT instruments for integration into the SSA's data collection and disability evaluation processes. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541512, Size Standard - $21.0 million dollars.</p>
<p>The vendor responses must demonstrate their expertise in ALL of the areas described above. Please note that failure to specifically demonstrate capability to provide the required services in your response to this market survey may affect the Government's review of industry's ability to perform these services. The vendor's response shall be in sufficient detail to allow the Government to assess the capability of your firm.</p>
<p>The vendor response shall also include any other specific and relevant information related to the requirements of this project that will enable the Government to determine the capabilities of the company to perform the specialized requirements described in this synopsis. Interested organizations must demonstrate and document in any response submitted, to this market survey extensive experience with and the ability to perform all of the specialized requirements elsewhere described.</p>
<p>This notice is a market survey and is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The Government will not award a Purchase Order or Contract based upon Vendor responses to this announcement. The Government shall not assume any costs for preparing or submitting any information in response to the market survey or the Government's use of the information. Any proprietary information should be clearly identified as "proprietary information".</p>
<p>Vendors must send written capability responses by December 6, 2010 to the Contract Specialist at the following e-mail address Diania.Robinson@nih.gov. For any questions, please contact Ms. Diana Robinson at (301) 594-5917.</p>

Systems for detection may include, but are not limited to, ion mobility spectrometry, colorimetric chemistry, x-ray, terahertz, magnetometric, infrared and raman spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging, or a combination of several modes of detection.  Sample analysis and detection shall not require the presence of anyone aside from the individual being interrogated.
  This sources sought notice solicits vendors' information that fully explains their existing technology features, capabilities, and performance. NAVEODTECHDIV plans to select Automated Entry Control Point Systems (AECPS) for comparative testing and evaluation.  Reports will be written and available for use by government agencies and all the services.  Technologies of AECPS and Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detection that protect the forces and prevent terrorist attacks against military personnel, equipment and military installations by finding them at points of entry are sought.  Ideally, these technologies will allow antiterrorist/force protection/physical security personnel to find threats, effectively and reliably, while reducing the manpower required for inspecting personnel (to include personal articles carried by personnel) at military installations' entry points without slowing throughput.
  The purpose of the AECPS is to screen for and detect explosives as well as other threats without requiring additional personal dedicated for sample collection and/or analysis.

This announcement serves to survey product availability, and is NOT a formal solicitation and is NOT an RFP.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes ONLY, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Our intent is to test technologically mature and market ready equipment.

4.	Performance Parameters for Automated Entry Control Point Systems. 
The following  performance parameters measure AECPS performance in inspecting representative threats at the point of entry onto government and military installations under typical Point of Entry operational and environmental conditions. 
4.1	Detection Effectiveness, measured as a percentage, consists of the number of successful threat detections compared to the number of objects of interest inspected.
 
4.1.1	Successful Detections include: a) True Positives - AECPS determines the presence of a threat when a threat is present. b) True Negatives - AECPS determines that threats are not present when threats are not present. 
4.1.2	Unsuccessful detections include: a) False Positives - AECPS determines that there are threats present when threats are NOT present, and b) False Negatives - AECPS determines that there are no threats present when threats ARE present. 
4.1.3	IED threat may include the following explosives: ANFO, RDX/C4, TNT, PETN, Semtex, Chlorates, Water Gels, Black Powders, Smokeless Powders, Perchlorates, Peroxides and Dynamites. 
4.2	Detection Speed, measured in objects of interest per hour, is the number of objects of interest that can be fully inspected per hour, once the AECPS is operational.
 Inspecting time is defined as the minimum time interval possible between the start of an object of interest and the start of the succeeding object of interest at the point of entry, e. g. total time for inspector to utilize the AECPS and conduct analysis. AECPS preparation and analysis time for that object of interest (excluding initial AECPS operation time, self-checks, etc.) 
4.3	Ease of Use is a subjective evaluation based on the responses of an operator survey, which assess the level of difficulty of operation.  
4.4	Transportability/Portability consists of two functions - transport of the main component of the AECPS to the administrative facility, and the physical movement of the AECPS to allow analysis by the main component of the AECPS.
  This requirement will be assessed in terms of the time, manpower and situational needs of operators manning the Point of Entry. 
4.5	Reliability is measured by the degree that the AECPS will complete the AECPS mission without an operational mission failure for all objects requiring screening. Inability of AECPS to initiate analysis when required constitutes an operational mission failure. 
4.6	Maintainability (Mean Time Between Maintenance), measured in hours, is the duration of time that, on average the AECPS will function as designed without maintenance beyond actions that can be performed by the operator with a prescribed list of spare parts and/or consumable supplies. 
5.	Test Conditions:
5.1	Standard Conditions and Threat.
  These standard conditions and representative threats are intended to provide a common basis for comparing each AECPSs features, capabilities, and performance against user-defined requirements. 
5.1.1	Representative threats shall be used as objects of interest that may or may not contain typical explosives that might be conveyed through the Point of Entry. IEDs shall consist of various explosives that might be contained in personal articles carried on personnel, and personnel themselves. 
5.2	Typical Operational Scenario.  AECPS will be used to non-intrusively inspect personal articles carried on personnel, and personnel themselves that might convey through the Point of Entry. 
DEFINITIONS 
Automated Entry Control Point Systems - devices that determine the presence explosives without requiring personnel outside the individual being screened for analysis.
 
Explosive Detection Equipment  Devices that determine the presence of characteristics of energetic/explosive materials
False Alarm Rate - the probability that an AECPS classifies the object of interest as an explosive when no explosives are present.  
Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) - an expediently packaged explosive charge detonated by an initiator with a customized fuzing and firing circuit, also known as a bomb. 
Objects of Interest  the subject matter of attention, for example mail, small parcels, personal articles, and personnel themselves
Performance Parameter - capabilities required for successful mission accomplishment. 
Point of Entry - the passageway through a protected perimeter through which all personnel pass.

<DESC>PURPOSE: This is a Sources Sought announcement to assess the interest and qualifications of HUBZone certified small business firms, in competing for a contract for an anticipated procurement entitled "Roofing" at all U.S. Federal and military installations on Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands. The information provided will be used to determine whether to issue the proposed solicitation as a competitive set-aside or whether to issue as full and open competition (unrestricted). The information provided will not be disclosed out of the agency and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research. <br />PROJECT INFORMATION: This anticipated project is currently slated as a Request for Proposal (RFP) procurement to be conducted per the procedures outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 15 and 36. The anticipated contract will be a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract. The project includes providing experience, personnel and a capability to perform a broad range of maintenance, repair, and minor construction work on various real property facilities. The above general description of work does not in any way limit the responsibility of the Contractor to perform all work, supervision, management, quality control, labor, tools, equipment appliances and material and performance in strict accordance with specification, drawings and subject terms and conditions of each task order and the basic contract. The estimated performance period of the contract will include a one-year base period with the option to extend for four (4) additional one-year option periods. The maximum value of all work will be limited to $50M over the life of the contract. Tasks under the contract are estimated to vary in size from $2,000 to $10,000,000. The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this anticipated procurement is 238990 with a small business size standard of $14,000,000. <br />WHO MAY RESPOND: Interest in this Sources Sought announcement is open to HUBZONE certified small business prime contractors, relative to the primary NAICS code 238990. Following review of the responses to this notice, and if the Government still plans to proceed with an acquisition, the Government will develop an acquisition strategy to determine whether the solicitation for this project will be issued as HUBZone certified small business set aside. <br />Note to Small Businesses: Small businesses may team together (or even affiliate) and be eligible for award of a set-aside contract, provided that each team member meets the small business size standard for the acquisition and are deemed capable. The current Small Business Administrative (SBA) rules allow a set-aside when there is a reasonable expectation of at least two or more competitive offers from small business teams when at least 50% of the effort will be performed by the collective efforts of all small business members of the team. The current SBA 8(a) affiliation rules allow joint ventures or teams when the 8(a) concern performs a "significant amount" of the work with its own employees and the size of at least one 8(a) participant to the joint venture is less than one half the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR SMALL BUSINESS ONLY. This is not a request for offers or proposals. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This is a market research tool being utilized to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to issuing a Request for Qualifications. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for information received as a result of this announcement. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.<br /><br />The General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission architects and engineers to maintain and modernize our legacy federal buildings for the next 50 - 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; and creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees.<br /><br />In this context, GSA is in the process of determining the availability, adequacy, and capabilities of potential small business sources prior to issuing a Request for Qualification for performance of Architectual-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy targets and security requirements.<br />If no responses are received from potentially responsible sources, GSA under the FAR part 19.501(b) will have completed its due diligence regarding setting this procurement aside for small businesses and will proceed with procuring this requirement on an unrestricted basis.<br /><br />The GSA is in need of a Lead Design firm on a federal prospectus level project for the repair and alteration of the Frank Hagel Federal Building (FHFB) in Richmond, California. The GSA desires the lead designer to possess extensive capabilities and significant experience in both renovation design as well as structural/seismic upgrades in an occupied building. All work shall be in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements including federally established energy and sustainability goals, accessibility requirements and security specifications. <br /><br />The major tenant of the FHFB is the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA). In 2006, SSA requested GSA to initiate a complete realignment and modernization project at its regional office, the FHFB. SSA views the building realignment as critical to the mission of the agency. The purpose of the realignment is to remedy the current operational inefficiencies due to poor space allocation and utilization throughout the building. GSA has since completed a feasibility study and worked with SSA to develop a project that meets their space needs and modernizes a long-term asset in our regional portfolio.
<p>The project encompasses approximately 619,000 square feet on a site fully developed within a six (6) level office structure with both underground and surface parking. The design services shall be to provide structural and infrastructure revisions for the entire building, but the construction implementation is limited primarily to the basement and first level.</p>
<p>The estimated cost of construction for all three phases of this project is between $200,000,000 and $230,000,000. The anticipated award of this Architect-Engineer contract is April 2011. The duration of the contract is scheduled for 36 months.</p>
<p>A/E firms interested in this effort must be able to demonstrate experience with similar projects as defined in Similar Projects below:</p>

To be considered similar in type project(s) must include both of the following elements: Renovation of an existing building and Renovation of an occupied building. To be considered similar in complexity projects shall include, but are not limited to, Office Buildings, Public Buildings or Institutional Use Buildings.</p>
<p>This procurement, whether it be set-aside for small business or procured on an unrestricted basis, shall be made under Product Service Code (PSC) C211, North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 541310 for Architectural services.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Procurement Directorate will host an Industry Day on Friday, December 3, 2010. This one day event will provide a forum by which the Department can communicate its requirements and increase competition by sharing useful information.
<p>The purpose of this Industry Day is to provide industry with information regarding CBPs intent to advertise and solicit a potential requirement for commercial equipment and services to support tactical communication requirements. During the event, the Government will provide an overview of the requirement, and will offer address specific acquisition rules, small business opportunities, and other specifications of the Land Mobile Radio (LMR) requirement. Attendees will be able to ask the Government's representatives questions about the requirement and presentations. All potential offeror's are welcome. CBP highly encourages Small Businesses to send representatives to the Industry Day to network with larger firms in order to provide potential partnership opportunities. The Government is hoping for a cross-section of the LMR industry to help define competitive requirements versus proprietary requirements. Potentially this will result in a sole-source contract for proprietary services and a competitive contract(s) for all other requirements.</p>
<p>Event Details:<br />The event will be held on Friday, December 3, 2010 at the Ronald Reagan Building room B1.5-10. Doors will open for sign-in at 8:30 AM, and we expect to be completed by 12:30 PM.</p>
<p><br />Event Attendance Notification:<br />Those interested in attending are encouraged to send an email stating their intent on attending the event to Kimberly.L.Cooper@dhs.gov. Contractors can bring as many attendees as they choose. Please note that registration information will be available to the public.</p>

<DESC>CONTRACT NO.:  F11PX00732
Notice for a SOLE SOURCE requirement in accordance with the 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6, 6.302-1, Only one responsible source, able to support the government's goal for community outreach and recruitment while fulfilling a Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program and Management Directive 715.  Arrupe High School is 97% underrepresented and is the only known participating high school, through the Department of Education and Work-Study Program, which falls into the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) area.  The USFWS Contracting and General Services Office in Denver, Colorado intends to award Sole Source to Arrupe High School, 4343 Utica, Denver, CO 80212,for temporary clerical services 6 December 2010 - 10 June 2011, UNIT OF ISSUE:  Weeks QUANTITY: 28. A full copy of the Justification and Approval may be found at http://www.fws.gov/contracts/ja.aspx?id=448361AB-3D27-49FC-AE8C-40284484638E  
USFWS believes, based on market research, that Arrupe High School is the only source of the 24 participates that fall into USFWS region and able to support both the goals of the school and government.   Procurement of these services from another service would likely be incompatible with the goals of the program and would result in higher substantial cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.   
Any parties who feel they have the capabilities required to do the above are welcome to provide documentation on their expertise and qualifications for consideration by 2 December 2010, 10:00 AM ET (8:00 AM MT).  All such documentation should be sent to the point of contact listed in this announcement.  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. The intent of this announcement is to determine if any source(s) exist.  Therefore, a solicitation will not be made available.  
All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  
The USFWS point of contact for this requirement is Jacqueline Carter, Contract Specialist at 303-236-4772, jacqueline_e_carter@fws.gov, FAX 303-236-4791.

<DESC>Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Architectural and Engineering Services Contract, Region 7, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,  Alaska, NAICS 541310,The USFWS, Region 7, intends to extend the period of performance under Contract Number 701816D042, HDR Engineering, 2525 C Street, Suite 305, Anchorage, AK 99503-2632 and Contract 701816D041,PDC, Inc,, 1231 Gambell Street, Anchorage, AK  99501-4627 for an additional six (6) months via an non-competitive modification.  Contracts are Firm Fixed Price Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contracts for  architect-engineering (AE) services for planning, studies, plans and specifications, cost estimates, surveying, soil investigations, contamination surveys, interpretive design, construction management services, field inspections and reports, and interior design services.  This contract shall provide the continuing requirement for AE services while Region 7 procures new 5-yr  IDIQ contracts.  The period is extended from February 28, 2011, the current contract expiration date, to August 30, 2011.  The extended period is in part due to USFW conversion from its current financial and contracting systems to its new Financial Business Management System.   The conversion of the system imposes constraints on the agency which precludes award of new multiple year contracts prior to conversion to the new system in Fall of 2011.   Extension shall be made under the authority for other than full and open competition FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B) due to unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for statements of qualifications or proposals. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. Any questions or comments should be addressed to the Contracting Officer, Claudette McDonald  by email at Claudette.m.mcdonald@fws.gov within the 30-day period of this posting.

<CONTACT>Jennifer N. Henley, Phone 202 283-1670, Fax 202-283-6907, Email jennifer.n.henley@irs.gov
<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service intends to award a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for Oracle software maintenance commercial items to Mythics, Inc.  This BPA will be awarded against the vendors GSA FSS 70 contract.  However, this intent is being posted as the vendor does not have all the required items on its GSA FSS 70 contract.  The open market items will be awarded on the basis of brand name requirement (FAR 6.302-1(c)) and only one responsible source (FAR 6.302-1(a)).  This BPA and subsequent delivery order will be fulfilled by the delivery of software maintenance on the current Oracle database software licenses.  

The brand name requirement and RFQ for the Oracle software maintenance renewal were posted on GSAs e-buy system in accordance with FAR 8.405-6.  Only one vendor, Mythics, Inc, responded to the RFQ.  It was later determined (prior to award) that some of the products on the Mythics, Inc quote were no longer on its FSA FSS 70 contract due to the age of the products.  Oracle, the manufacturer, sent notice to the Contracting Officer on November 22, 2010 that Oracles Technical Support Policy (TSP) and GSA T&Cs prohibit the breaking apart of the licenses that were originally ordered together (a license set).  Oracles TSP is incorporated into its GSA FSS 70 contract per Section 3 Part 4a of the GSA T&Cs.  Oracle requires that the entire license set be renewed at the same time or Oracle would have to reprice the support.  Breaking apart the license set is considered de-supporting and in accordance with Oracles GSA Terms and Conditions Section 3, Part 4 a, An ordering activity may de-support a subset of licenses in a license set only if the ordering activity agrees to terminate that subset of licenses.  The IRS still requires the use of the open market items and therefore the subset of licenses can not be terminated.  As database software Oracle has been approved as the standard for Tier 2 Unix database processing for over 10 years.  Oracle is the only original equipment manufacturer that fulfills the IRS needs.

<DESC>NIH intends to award a sole source contract to OLBN to provide A/E services for Post Design, Bidding, Construction Administration Services and Optional A/E Services for Renovation Dental Clinic, First Floor, B Wing, Building 10, Bethesda, Maryland campus. OLBN is the Architect or Record for the original design, and the post design services are an on-going function of the Architect of Record. It is the intent of the NIH to retain OLBN fully liable for the contract documents (CD i.e. design documents). This requirement is being conducted in accordance with the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302- 1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." <br />This project started in 2006 as a design-building with Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR) as prime contractor. OLBN was the A/E firm. Due to budget constraints, the project was halted in 2009 at 95% design, with a few issues unresolved. The OLBN design was resumed recently. The addition of medical gas and electrical upgrades to DP 1260A37 and Vault 1 are now in the scope of services. On October 25, 2010, OLBN completed the 100% design for renovation of the dental clinic under contract with KBR. The contract with KBR has terminated, and any changes to the 100% design during the post design and construction administration phases of the dental clinic project will be obtained directly from OLBN. <br />The scope of services to be carried out Post Design and Construction Administration services by OLBN include the following:
<p>Task 1: RFI, as built drawings<br />&bull;Responsible for RFI from contractor provide resolution within five working days<br />&bull;Provide as-built drawings within two weeks after construction complete.</p>
<p>Task 2: Provide Construction Management Services consist of site visits, attend construction review meetings, review of shop drawings, inspection and verify construction according to A/E specifications. Provide punch list at final walk through.<br />CM services shall include the following:</p>
<p>&bull;One site visit per week<br />&bull;At least one site inspection/review meeting last two hours every two week<br />&bull;Additional site visit or meeting if requested by project officer<br />&bull;Advise project officer of potential problems, help resolve these problems as part of project team<br />&bull;CM takes meeting minute and distribute to participants within 48 hours</p>
<p>The NIH intends to retain OLBN Architectural &amp; Planning for the following reasons:<br /><br />&bull; OLBN is the Architect of Record and as such is the only one that can be held liable for errors and omissions. OLBN developed the construction documents (CD) i.e. design, were part of the original A/E design work which commenced in 2006 and had to be discontinued due to budget constraints in 2009 at 95% design. The 100% design was completed and submitted to NIH on October 25, 2010. However, NIH must acquire the services of OLBN for post design services and construction administrative services.</p>
<p>&bull;OLBN team members have the professional liability as Architect of Record of these CD's and stamped them.</p>
<p>&bull;No other A&amp;E firm can be held liable for another A&amp;E firm CD's. The OLBN team members, by virtue of being the Architect of Record, OLBN are the only source that can maintain custodianship for errors and omissions in the Post Design phase.</p>
<p>&bull;No other A/E will assume error and omissions insurance for OLBN.</p>
<p><br />This notice of intent is not a request for proposals. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This procurement is not a set-aside for small business. The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541310.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the Utility Privatization of the Electrical Distribution System at Hanscom AFB, MA. The Sources Sought and Presolicitation notices for this requirement was originally published under RFP FA3002-10-R-0001. Hanscom AFB is located 20 miles northwest of Boston, Massachusetts and is surrounded by the towns of Bedford, Lexington, Lincoln, and Concord. The Base occupies approximately 846 acres of land, (252 acres donated without restrictive covenants, 373 acres fee simple, 154 acres purchased, 1 acre undesignated general, 7 acres with right-of-way access, 59 acres leased [21 years remaining on the lease with a 10 year extension at government option - no utilities to be privatized are located on leased property]), and has approximately 200 buildings and other facilities with a total square footage of approximately 5.5 million square feet. Approximately 7,763 people work at Hanscom AFB. <br />The Hanscom AFB electric distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point of demarcation defined by the Right of Access.

The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Offeror shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the provided description and inventory.<br />Specifically excluded from the electric distribution system privatization are: <br />&bull; Emergency Generators, except generator at Main Substation that is part of the Substation configuration.<br />&bull; Facility-fed Parking Lot and Security Lighting<br />&bull; Hanscom AFB Military Housing electric distribution<br />&bull; Electric meters installed on transformer secondary<br />&bull; Hanscom AFB EMCS monitoring equipment, except for the SCADA and fault indicator equipment systems <br />&bull; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Lincoln Laboratory substation and feeds (NSTAR owned and operated)<br />&bull; Government-owned meters at MIT facilities<br />&bull; Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport) L.G. Hanscom Field Regional Airport<br />&bull; Ipswich Antenna Test Facility<br />Hanscom AFB electrical service is provided at 14.4-kilovolts (kV) through three sets of 500-thousand-circular-mill (kcmil or MCM) EPR cables to the Base substation. At the Base perimeter, near the Small Business Office (Building 1100) and the former Phillips Laboratory Gate (Gate 3), a manhole is located where responsibility for the electrical system shifts from NSTAR, the transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) provider, and Transcanada, the commodity provider, to Hanscom AFB.
<p>From the manhole at the Base perimeter, the circuits are routed through an underground duct bank to the Base's main substation. This substation serves as the main power distributor for the entire Base. That portion of the substation where the main incoming and feeder breakers are housed is made up of a section of walk in metal enclosed switchgear. This is where the Electric Utility owned revenue meters are located. The switchgear main bus is rated for 2,000 A at 15 kV. The main incoming NSTAR lines and bus tie circuit breakers are rated 2,000 amperes (A) and the feeder breakers are rated 1,200 A, all at 15 kV. The switchgear is arranged in a four bus configuration with an incoming feed serving each of three of the four buses with tie breakers between adjacent buses. Each of the four buses has three feeder breakers for serving load. Spaces for three spare breakers are available on Bus No. 2 and 3 to allow for future expansion. From the main bus, three breakers feed the three 3,750-kV amperes (kVA), 14.4- to 4160/2520-V power transformers located in the substation. One of the transformers feeds the former Phillips Laboratory and part of the former Rome Laboratory area. A second (newest) transformer serves the on-Base steam and chilled water plant. The third transformer is used as a spare transformer and may be used to backup either of the two utilized transformers. Switching arrangements are available to shift loads and services among all three transformers. From the main bus, five distribution circuits feed the remainder of the Base.<br />All primary feed is contained within concrete encased conduit, 75% of which under pavement.<br />The Hanscom AFB electric distribution system is currently monitored by fault indicator equipment at 73 total locations throughout the main base. Fault indicator equipment is connected to the EMCS system on the electric distribution wiring. The SCADA system reads the substation. Equipment is monitored at the computer in the Exterior Electric Shop, Building 1817. A SCADA system reads the substation.<br />NSTAR is the transportation and distribution provider and Transcanada is the commodity provider that supplies power to the Fourth Cliff Family Recreational Area through a single service at the main entrance.<br />National Grid supplies power to the Sagamore Hill Air Weather Services Facility through a tap from the 4.16-kilovolt (kV) distribution feeder on Sagamore Street. Located at the feeder tap are the metering facilities and riser pole transition down to the government-owned underground circuit that feeds up the hill and into the station. Government ownership of the electric facilities starts at the load side of the air break switch located at the metering facilities along Sagamore Street.<br />The Town of Hudson's Office of the Light and Power Department supplies power to the Sudbury Geophysics Research Annex through one overhead service to the facility. Government ownership of the electric facilities starts at the load side of the primary metering pole along Hudson Road.</p>

Hanscom Field Regional Airport <br />The Town of Lexington provides potable water supply to Hanscom AFB through three metered connections:<br />&bull; Hartwell Avenue connection - located where the Hanscom AFB 8-inch main connects to the Town of Lexington main at the Town of Lexington-owned meter on Hartwell Avenue. <br />&bull; Wright Street connection - located where the Hanscom AFB 10-inch main, located within a 50-foot wide easement through an off-Base housing development, connects to the Town of Lexington-owned meter near Katahdin Hill on Wright Street. <br />&bull; Wood Street Emergency connection - this connection is made through a normally closed 8-inch main on Wood Street which connects to the Town of Lexington owned meter connection, which is approximately 100 feet southeast of its intersection with Hartwell Avenue.<br />The Town of Bedford provides water to the Hanscom AFB Family Camp area.<br />Hanscom AFB as well as both towns receive their water from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA). Hanscom AFB holds a 1996 Certificate of Registration (PWS ID# 3023002) from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Division of Water Supply as a registered public water supplier in Massachusetts. The Towns of Lexington and Bedford, which supply the water, provide water quality monitoring. MWRA provides disinfection. The Base has discontinued use of its hypochlorite injection disinfection systems since the water system generally contains approximately 2 milligrams per liter (mg/L) of available chlorine. Hanscom AFB currently provides no additional disinfection for the water system.<br />The water supply pressure from the Town of Lexington is too high for standard municipal service and, therefore, is reduced for use on the Base at two pressure reducing valve stations which then provide adequate water pressure on Base. <br />The average depth of the buried pipe at Hanscom AFB is approximately seven feet.<br />The City of Marshfield, through a cooperative agreement with the Town of Scituate, supplies potable water to the Fourth Cliff Family Recreation Area from a Town of Scituate main located near the facility gate. A Town of Scituate water meter is located near the connection and meters water consumption. The potable water distribution system serves cabins, other structures, and recreational vehicle (RV) hookups. <br />The Town of Hamilton supplies potable water to the Sagamore Hill Air Weather Services Facility from a Town main located near the gate. A Town water meter located at the main building meters water consumption.

<p>(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>
<p>(3) For long-term contracts--</p>
<p>(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and</p>
<p>(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract.

<p>(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p>(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>
<p>(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THIS IS A SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR THE OFFICE OF PLANNING &amp; ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS DIVISION (TPE-22) PROGRAM SUPPORT SERVICES</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Department of Transportation, Federal Transit Administration (FTA), on behalf of Office of Planning &amp; Environment Analysis Division, intends to procure Measuring Congestion Relief Benefits Support Services using FAR Part 15 competitive procedures. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a FAR Part 15 fully competitive Solicitation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, Small Businesses are strongly encouraged to participate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government reserves the option to set this requirement aside for other than full &amp; open competition through the receipt of proposal process, provided, that two (2) or more small businesses respond with clear evidence their ability to provide the required services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The designated NAICS code is 541330 with a Small Business size standard of $4.5M.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interested parties are encouraged to submit a more suitable NAICS Code before or during the Questions and Answer period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Questions about this requirement are to be submitted NLT seven (7) days (30 NOV 2010) after publication of the Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all personnel, supervision as non-personal services necessary to perform Measuring Congestion Relief Benefits Support Services in seven topic areas: (a) <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Review of Best Current Practices;</span></strong> (b) <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Develop an Approach for Performance Testing;</span></strong> (c) <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Test and Validate Proposed Approach(s); (d)</span></strong> <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Develop Options for National Implementation; (e)</span></strong> <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Prepare Final Reports; (f)</span></strong> <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Apply the Selected Approach to Several New Starts Projects; and (g) Assist in Implementing the Selected Approach(s)</span></strong>, as defined in this Statement of Work (SOW).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contractor shall perform to the standards in this contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scope of this requirement is as follows:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">SAFETEA-LU revised the criteria for the selection of New Starts transit projects under the Section 5309 Major Capital Investments program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The legislation required that U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) consider six criteria in the evaluation and rating of proposed New Starts transit projects: mobility improvements, environmental benefits, operating efficiencies, cost effectiveness, land use, and financial commitment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One element of the mobility improvements criterion is the reduction in highway travel times resulting from a transit improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">USDOT is committed to incorporating highway benefits into its mobility and cost effectiveness rating in every way feasible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current regulation on the New Starts program defines user benefits to include benefits to highway users.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, the "Summit" software used by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to calculate user benefits has had, since its initial release in 2002, the capability to capture congestion-relief benefits accruing to users of the highway system in addition to benefits accruing to new and existing transit users.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">However, FTA cannot currently credit proposed projects with predicted benefits to highway users because (1) FTA has found that most travel models around the country do not predict plausible changes in highway speeds resulting from transit improvements and (2) the absence of a consistent method for highway speed prediction leads directly to potentially large differences in the predicted benefits of transit projects with similar impacts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, to account for the otherwise missing congestion-relief benefits, FTA adds a standard 20-percent allowance to the predicted benefits to transit users in the calculation of the cost-effectiveness of a project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In summary, while USDOT acknowledges the value of reductions in vehicle-miles of highway travel in terms of reducing congestion, the department has not yet been able to develop methodologies capable of making reliable, nationally consistent estimates of project-specific benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Background </span></strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">In 2002 and 2003, with the introduction of the user-benefits measure for New Starts projects, FTA observed that the forecasts for many proposed projects included congestion-relief benefits that appeared unrelated to the projects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the geographic pattern of the benefits seemed entirely random.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In response, FTA funded an intensive research effort intended to (1) confirm the apparent randomness of the congestion-relief forecasts, (2) identify the source(s) of the problem, and (3) develop effective solutions that could be implemented nationally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>FTA also funded participation in this effort by a working group of seven senior travel forecasters from metropolitan areas that have built major transit projects with New Starts funding assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The research succeeded fully on the first two objectives and had partial success on the third objective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An effective national solution remained elusive, however, to the challenge of measuring the congestion-relief benefits of proposed New Starts projects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically:</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .25in; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><span>&bull;b)<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Detailed analysis of this problem identified a variety of causes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By far, the largest source of error is incomplete closure of iterative methods used to reach "equilibrium" conditions in traffic assignment algorithms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Incomplete closure means that the assignment algorithms are not able to produce the result that is the central premise of these algorithms - that all travel paths through a congested highway network are loaded with traffic volumes that yield equal travel times on all paths available for travel between each origin-destination pair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The research results demonstrated conclusively that premature termination of these algorithms produces apparently random changes in traffic volumes and, therefore, in traffic speeds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A smaller - but still significant - source of error is inconsistency between the highway path builder and the mode choice model in terms of the weights applied to travel times and costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This inconsistency leads to path choices that the highway path builder views as better in the build alternative than in the baseline but the mode choice model viewed as worse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The inevitable result is the occurrence of negative benefits for an apparently random set of origin-destination pairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The apparent success of the research into the technical issues was tempered, however, by a substantial problem that became clear during the course of the work: the wide variation in methods and assumptions used to predict traffic volumes and speeds across metropolitan areas in the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Presentations, discussion, and documentation of the procedures used by the seven members of the working group highlighted the many differences in local procedures, key underlying assumptions, data used to develop the procedures, and rigor used to test their performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The discussions also highlighted the challenges in efforts to change these locally adapted procedures given their central role in air-quality conformity determinations - and the transportation funding jeopardy caused by conformity problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In brief, local procedures to predict traffic volumes and speeds may differ in terms of the:</span></p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Other strategies may also hold promise so long as they offer technically defensible, assumable, nationally consistent approaches that can be implemented within three years.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">USDOT does not anticipate groundbreaking research but rather expects that the results will build upon good practice already in place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the anticipated approach relies on identification of candidate traffic assignment procedures already implemented in one or more metropolitan areas, rigorous testing of the properties of those procedures, possible updates to the methodologies, and - assuming technically acceptable results - exploration of ways that USDOT adapt the procedures nationally.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">A final clarification on the approach to this research deals with the conceptual framework for evaluating impacts on highway travel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Longstanding discussions on "induced travel" have wrestled with the reality that any project that adds capacity to the transportation system will lead to increases in the amount of travel that offset any short-term congestion relief.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This general observation is a direct application of the simple principle that a reduction in the price of any product - travel, in this case - causes consumers to buy more of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The details are more complicated, as always.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Reductions in the generalized price of travel caused by reductions in the travel times lead to changes in a panoply of choices made by travelers: route, time of day, mode, destination, residence location, workplace location, and so forth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Current practice in travel forecasting is unable to predict the full range of these consequences, particularly when the price reduction is caused by improved transit options.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Research on more capable travel forecasting procedures is proceeding elsewhere with USDOT support but is likely to succeed only in a much longer time frame that will be useful to the task at hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Consequently, FTA has adopted an approach that views congestion relief as a proxy measure for benefits that occur at many other levels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If the transit improvement cause the first-order benefits for transit riders, then congestion relief in the highway system can be viewed as the second-order<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>benefits for highway users, and consequent changes in trip-making and location choices can be viewed as the third-,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>fourth-, and higher-order benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because these higher-order benefits are caused by first- and second-order price changes - and work to diminish those initial price changes, then a reliable way to evaluate the full set of benefits is to consider only the first- and second-order benefits without any attempt to predict the higher-order effects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In practice, this approach means that an estimate of congestion relief for highway users - unadjusted for changes in times of day, origin-destination patterns, or longer-term location choices - is sufficient to represent the full range of higher order choices, their benefits, or their offsetting impacts on congestion relief itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This research therefore focuses on improving the accuracy and national consistency of methods to predict congestion relief and leaves to other efforts the much larger task of improving other aspects of travel forecasting practice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The sole exception to this narrow focus is the final task that provides for the inclusion of research recommendations that may address longer-term efforts to improve other elements of current travel forecasting practice.</span></p>

<p>The procurement is being conducted on a competitive basis. The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 339999 and the Size Standard is 500 Employees.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA), for the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), intends to award a fixed priced purchase order for the purchase of a Human induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Training Course.</p>
<p>Period of performance: <br />The contractor will conduct training in December 2010 to instruct 20 IRP scientists in how to generate and culture human iPSCs. A total of 4 instructors are needed to teach the course, providing a high level of individual instruction over a 3 day period.<br /><br />In order to be considered for an award, an offeror must have completed the online electronic Representations and Certifications located at http://orca.bpn.giov/ in accordance with FAR 4.1201(a). By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR at www.ccr.gov/ prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchase agreement resulting from this solicitation. NOTE: lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for award.</p>
<p>Background<br />The Director of NIH has established an Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Center in its Intramural Research Program. This center will be administered by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Investigators from all appropriate ICs will learn to generate IPSCs and investigate their biology and potential therapeutic uses. The mission is to bring this exciting new technology to clinical reality within the NIH Intramural Research Program and the NIH Clinical Center. The Center will be expected to conduct world class research that will catalyze new approaches and uses of IPSCs and differentiated cells derived from them, and/or cells trans-differentiated from somatic cells for the entire biomedical research community. The IPSC Center will promote the use of this technology and provide researchers with training to facilitate clinical development of IPSCs.</p>
<p>The objective is to train 20 investigators in the derivation of human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPS) and provide training in generating, maintaining and storing human IPS cell lines. Instructors will provide "state of the art" information on reprogramming somatic cells to become pluripotent.</p>
<p>The NIH needs to train investigators how to generate human iPS cells and is seeking a company with proven experience in iPS cell generation and in providing effective training courses to beginning and advanced iPS researchers that contribute to successful iPS cell generation.<br /><br />Contractor Requirements<br />The services to be provided under this order shall include the following:</p>
<p>- Conduct training in December 2010 to instruct 20 IRP scientists in how to generate and culture human iPSCs. A total of 4 instructors are needed to teach the course, providing a high level of individual instruction over a 3 day period.</p>
<p>- The course will include didactic information and "hands on" experience in making iPS cells for students who may have little to no experience in stem cell technology. The company will provide tested reagents that effectively and reproducibly mediate generation of human iPS cells, as well as appropriate consumables.</p>
<p>Mandatory Qualifications<br />1. Corporate Experience<br />NIAMS is seeking a company to provide courses to teach IRP researchers how to generate mouse and human iPS cells. NIAMS is seeking a company with proven experience in iPS cell generation and in providing effective training courses to beginning and advanced iPS researchers that contribute to successful iPS cell generation.</p>
<p>Scored Evaluation Criteria<br />1. Quality Control Program - 100 points<br /><br />a. Skill in teaching beginner iPS students- 60 points<br />b. High instructor to student ratio- 15 points<br />c. Ability to teach human iPS cell course on site at NIH 25 points<br /><br />Cost/price is a selection factor. All evaluation factors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost/price, but not to the exclusion of consideration of cost or price. The closer offerors are determined to be in technical merit, the greater the importance of cost or price in making an award. If offerors' proposals are evaluated as technically comparable, then cost/price will become an important consideration. A best value determination will be made.</p>
<p>FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition are: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JUN 2008); FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999); FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (AUG 2009); FAR 212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (JUN 2010); FAR 52-212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (JUL 2010) is included with the following additional clauses: FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - Central Contractor Registration (OCT2003); and FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration (APR2008).</p>

The amount to be provided to employees for 2011 through 2012 is $1,000. Minimum Mandatory Performance Requirements include but are not limited to: Designing and developing plan documents, booklets and administration manual as needed for regulatory compliance and employer management administration within 60 days of the contract award; Preparing and supplying employee booklets and claim forms within 60 days of the contract award; Developing and implementing financial systems, as appropriate for transfer of funds, reimbursement to employees and plan accounting within 60 days of contract award; Reimbursing funds to eligible employees; Determining eligibility for benefits and verifying eligibility for reimbursement; Preparing appropriate financial and administrative reports for the plans, including any nondiscrimination tests required; Administering the plans for the employer; Preparing correspondence with review and follow-up in conjunction with plan administration; Providing cost estimates on proposed benefit changes; Providing administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect any OTS information maintained in Contractors' custody; Preparing presentation materials, as requested, for management review; Providing on-going assistance, as requested to the employees and the Contracting Officers' Technical Representative (COTR); Ensuring that the Plan and Plan documents maintain compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, as they are changed, by recommending modifications, as necessary; Advising and assisting OTS in accomplishing an accurate and timely annual FSA program enrollment, and Reviewing current FSA program annual election form and recommend modifications, as necessary.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

B.2.4.		Statement of Work 

Mass spectroscopy (MS) is an essential tool for protein identification and sequencing in the emerging fields of BLS and clinical research. Traditionally, protein sequencing was a technically demanding and tedious task. Thus, in recent years it has rarely been applied to intact proteins and has not been suitable for identifying an array of proteins. For example, the technical obstacles would make it impractical to identify and characterize the difference in proteins synthesized by cancer cells vs. normal counterparts. Mass spectroscopy has changed the field. With mass spectroscopy, it is now practical to characterize the array of proteins in cancer cells vs. normal cells and also to evaluate the differences in post-translational characteristics and protein structure. Because our VA BHS lacks MS capability, the researches in our centers are hampered. Studies at the proteomic levels are not easily conducted without the powerful MS-based tool. While we have state of the art programs to acquire and store specimens from veteran related diseases, we don't have the most powerful techniques to acquire proteomic information from them. Currently investigators send samples to MS facilities at other institutions: it is suitable for analysis of single samples, typically only one protein. However, research analyzing the array of proteins in patient samples will not be generally possible unless we have the instrument installed at our institution. This deficiency makes our investigators less competitive for federal funding opportunities relevant to disease proteomics and protein marker discovery. We are now capable of upstream proteomic studies with 2-D gel and 2-D HPLC platforms. The QSTAR Elite Mass Spectrometer and its accessories will conjunct with these platforms to systematically conduct projects at the proteomic level. In summary, having the QSTAR Elite Mass Spectrometer system in continuous service will greatly enhance both clinical and laboratory research in VA BHS.  

QSTAR Elite Mass Spectrometer and accessories were purchased from Applied Biosystems Inc. (ABI).

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. 
The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. 
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

<DESC>Reference is made to the Sep 29, 2010 announcement, reference number 2010- 81026A, inviting submission of qualifications and proposal data for the Romania - Electronic Election Management System Feasibility Study.
<p><br />The following clarifications have been provided by the Grantee and/or USTDA in response to questions received:</p>
<p>This is a fixed price grant. Accordingly, the Offeror will determine how to expend the funds in order to completely fulfill the Terms of Reference. In addition:<br />&bull; The selected Contractor will negotiate the payment schedule with the Grantee, in accordance with the USTDA Mandatory Clauses, and USTDA funds will be paid directly to the Contractor. <br />&bull; The selected Contractor will not be required to submit expense bills to USTDA. Rather, the Contractor will submit invoices that are signed by the Grantee directly to USTDA for payment. Currency fluctuations do not factor into invoice payments.<br />&bull; Funds may not be used to pay taxes in the host country. <br />&bull; The mobilization payment is separate from the milestone payments and will count towards the total grant amount.<br />&bull; If approved, all invoices are paid to the selected contractor 30 days after receipt.<br />&bull; The Definitional Mission report included as Annex 2 to the RFP is included for background purposes only. The Grant Agreement (Annex 4) and the TOR (Annex 5) are the controlling documents.<br />&bull; The Grantee will typically provide in-kind support such as office space. However, the Contractor should be prepared to provide all services, including ground transportation, if not provided by the Grantee.</p>

The period of performance is a 365 day base-year followed by four (4) 1-year option periods and a potential 6-month extension of services. This is a follow-on effort to the current SABER Bridge contract, FA8601-10-D-0009. Required contractor expertise includes a Contract Manager, Environmental Manager, Design Manager, Quality Assurance Evaluator, and Project Manager. The Government anticipates significant subcontracting activity under the SABER contract and partnering is encouraged. Liquidated damages, if applicable, shall be specified in each task order.</p>

<DESC><p>Based on industry feedback and questions relative to the Draft RFP, we have refined our acquisition strategy. The purpose of this posting is to provide industry with a timeline as well as an outline of the primary changes in our strategy.<br /><br />First, the timeline is as follows. We will post answers to industry's questions no later than 30 Nov 10. The formal RFP will be released no later than 10 Dec 10 with proposals due 10 Jan 11. We anticipate contract award(s) within 30 days after proposal receipt. This of course is dependent on the number of proposals received.<br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to award multiple technology demonstration contract(s) in order to gain insight into the technologies AFGSC could potentially utilize to enhance nuclear asset tracking. There is presently no formal program, no follow-on acquisition, and no funding to pursue this project beyond these technology demonstrations. If a follow-on program were to occur in the future, it would be a competitive acquisition and offerors who are not awarded a technology demonstration contract will have the opportunity to compete. <br /><br />AFNWC anticipates making several firm-fixed price contract awards, estimated at no more than 10, pursuant to this acquisition depending on the number of fully capable proposals received and availability of funds. The estimated cumulative cost for all contracts awarded shall not exceed $3.5M. Individual contracts will not exceed $350,000.<br /><br />The acquisition will be "full and open" competition with preference given to qualified small businesses. Small business proposals will be evaluated first using technically acceptable criteria to rank order them. Contracts will be awarded in succession to all technically qualified small business offerors, dependent on availability of funds. Once the small business list of proposals is exhausted, large business proposals will be evaluated and rank ordered according to the same technically acceptable criteria. Again, contracts will be awarded in succession to all technically qualified offerors, dependent on availability of funds. <br /><br />The evaluation criteria is being simplified and broadened. Since these elements are currently under rewrite, we are simply providing an outline here of what the anticipated evaluation criteria may include: soundness of approach, number of capabilities within the government SOO the technology solution can currently satisfy, innovativeness of the approach and/or technological solution, and contract cost. Proposals will be rank ordered based on the number of capabilities offered, approach and cost. It is expected cost reasonableness will be determined using adequate price competition. There is no requirement to have knowledge of our current systems and/or nuclear processes and there is no requirement to have a capability that is already deployed within a military or secure environment. However, if offerors do possess nuclear logistics knowledge and can thus demonstrate how their technology could interface with these current systems, their proposal will be given extra weight in the rank ordering process. Likewise, if offerors have technology solutions that have already been deployed and are proven in a military or secure environment similar to AFGSC's environment, proposals will be given extra weight when rank ordering them. Based on the fact, the purpose of these contract(s) is to receive technology demonstrations and they require no knowledge of our current systems or nuclear processes, we will not be conducting an industry day or one-on-one sessions with offerors.<br /><br />The remainder of the draft RFP is also undergoing simplification. We anticipate deleting the past performance evaluation criteria. The page count for the SOW and demonstration plan (CDRL) may be reduced. And the CDRLs are being rewritten. The development plan will be required after receipt of the demonstration vice being due at the time of the proposal. The development plan will be a rough-order of-magnitude on what activities, cost and schedule would be required to further develop the technology. <br /><br />We thank industry for their interest in this program and for the questions and feedback we received on our Draft RFP. As previously stated industry questions will be answered no later than 30 Nov 10 and the RFP will be released no later than 10 Dec 10.<br /><br />Please direct all questions/concerns directly to the Contracting Officer at <a href="mailto:donna.heinz@kirtland.af.mil">donna.heinz@kirtland.af.mil</a>.</p>

<DESC>Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10, the Department of Defense Dependents Schools-Europe (DoDDS-E) Procurement Division is currently conducting market research for comments and to assess the availability of sources for a proposed maintenance contract(s). The Government seeks to identify potential technically capable and responsible sources with the applicable background, resources, infrastructure, and operational experience in Facilities and Grounds Maintenance, Custodial and Minor Construction throughout the countries of Italy, Spain, and&nbsp;Azores Island (Portugal). <br /><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) Only. This is not a request for offers or proposals. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. <br /><br />A Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) and technical exhibits are attached which provide information on the DoDDS-E requirement for the Mediterranean School District. Potential contractors will be responsible for providing management, oversight, direction and supervision for all work under this proposed contract. This includes but limited to include all matters pertaining to work identification, performance of services, quality control, maintaining and reporting on progress and completion dates, employee hiring, orientation and training, obtaining installation passes, efficient utilization, subcontractor payment and administration, and establishment and maintenance of performance records. All work performed shall comply with applicable U.S. and "in country" construction codes. The Contractor shall furnish all equipment necessary to perform all work under this proposed contract. Areas of a defined amount of space for equipment storage and office space will be provided.
<p>It is anticipated that a solicitation will be released that will allow for offerors to bid on requirements for all three countries - Italy, Spain and Portugal - or each country individually. We are considering awarding a Requirements contract for the facility inspection and maintenance, grounds maintenance and custodial program and a multiple Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for minor construction over &euro;18,000 (approximately $25,000). The anticipated procurement would solicit for all these requirements in one solicitation. Estimated period of performance is June 1, 2011 - May 31, 2012 plus four (4) option years.&nbsp; <strong><em>A 30-day or 45-day Phase-In will start June 1, 2011.</em></strong></p>
<p>Information received will be used to determine the availability of technically capable and responsible firms that would be interested in submitting offers for this anticipated solicitation. In addition, comments on the acquisition strategy and Draft PWS from industry would also be beneficial. All responses will be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a future solicitation.</p>
<p>The Draft PWS and considered award strategy do not define the final requirements and may be adjusted in the solicitation. DoDDS-E is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.</p>
<p>DoDDS-E will hold an Industry Day on December 7 and 8, 2010. December 7, 2010 will provide an overview of the organization and requirements as well as answer any questions in an open forum.

This notice does NOT require action or a response by offerors. The response date is simply the date in which this announcement will be archived by FedBizOps. ***
<p>__________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) provides timely, relevant and accurate geospatial intelligence in support of national security objectives. The National Geospatial-Intelligence College (NGC), located within the Human Development directorate, provides the NGA workforce with leadership and professional development training.</p>
<p>The Request for Proposal (RFP) will cover NGA's requirement to modernize its employee education programs (both curriculum content and delivery strategies), and move toward commercially available learning solutions. <br />The RFP will include the following training:<br /><br /><br />(a) Leadership Development Training <br />- Career-Long Leadership Development Program <br />- Executive Leadership Development Course<br />- Leadership Fundamentals Course<br /><br />(b) Professional Development Training<br />- Professional Communications Skills Training Program <br />- Interpersonal Communications Skills Course<br /><br />NGA is seeking to purchase pre-existing courses that will require minimal modification to meet its training mission. The courses may be commercially available or internal to the company.<br /><br />The Leadership and Professional Development (LPD) procurement will be conducted under full and open competition with no set-aside. The government anticipates a single award contract with a one year base period and four one-year option periods renewable annually, but not to exceed five years. The RFP number HM0177-10-R-0047 is estimated to be issued in&nbsp;December 2010. Contract award is estimated for May 2011 and the contract's period of performance is expected to commence sometime in July 2011. The contract will include Firm Fixed Price (FFP)-Performance Based CLINs for each service area and Cost Reimbursable CLINs for Other Direct Costs (ODCs). NGA expects to use Best Value/Tradeoff acquisition procedures and evaluation methods as described in FAR Part 15. Contract award will be made to the offeror who provides the best overall value to the Government in terms of the evaluation factors listed in Section M of the RFP. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 611430 - Professional and Management Development Training.<br /><br /><br />INTERESTED VENDORS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO RESPOND TO THIS PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE. Any projected proposal due dates and times in this synopsis and any subsequent updates are estimates only; the actual proposal due date and time will be established in the final RFP. The RFP will be available to interested parties, along with any amendments issued, solely on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website (https://www.fbo.gov). For information on how to register your company on FBO, to view or receive updates and notifications to the solicitation, please reference the FBO Vendor Guide located on the FBO web site home page. No paper copies of the solicitation will be furnished. Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration Database (www.ccr.gov), prior to award of a government contract; failure to register in the DOD Central Registration Database will render your firm ineligible for award. Registration requires applicants to have a DUNS number. Interested vendors are encouraged to register immediately in order to be eligible for award. The points of contact for this requirement are Adam Greenspan, 301-227-5901, Adam.M.Greenspan@nga.mil and Lora Mackin, 301-227-6933, Lora.L.Mackin@nga.mil.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) on behalf of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) to negotiate/award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Picometrics, Inc. for the purchase of a Laser Induced Fluorescent (LIF) detector.

The reference number NHLBI-PB-(EB)-2011-16.  

The Micro Analytical Immunochemistry Unit is a service lab within the Biomedical Engineering and Physical Science Shared Resource, which analyzes biological samples for biomarkers.  The Micro Analytical Immunochemistry Unit requires Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) Detector for a new capillary electrophoresis machine.   

The sole source determination is based on the fact that the LIF detector must interface with an existing capillary electrophoresis machine.  The LIF is the most sensitive detection method when analyzing materials by capillary electrophoresis.  The LIF Detector made by Picometrics is designed to fully interface with the capillary electrophoresis.  The LIF system has the sensitivity to detect the low concentrations of analytes and also has the ability to be turned to different wavelength lasers.  

This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the business size is 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>AMENDMENT NOTICE: This Amendment 0002 serves as an after review of the pre-proposal/ pre-bid site visit held November 18th , 2010, and to give the Government responses to questions received, Solicitation no. Q9420101013, VC Lighting, Lewis and Clark National Historical Park
Changes:Under Table of Quantities 4A, and Definition of Bid Terms, 1.5, A-1 and A-2 the wording shall be changed to 1. Occupancy sensors to control the 16 T-8 fixtures in the hallway area need to be designed and installed by the contractor.  2. Remove and replace 5 ballasts.
Q&A:1.  Question: Are there specifications in the package for the bulbs, etc.?
Answer:  There are general terms used in the specifications to describe the bid items, industry standards apply. 
2.  Question: Is there a crawl space and what room is available?
Answer:  Yes, there is a crawl space.  Access space varies considerably due to the peaked roofs, some areas you can stand up and others are very tight (e.g. the area above the restrooms).  This was discussed in greater detail on the tour as to where it is tight and where there is more room.  There is some lighting in the crawl space and there are some areas where the floor of the crawl space will not support weight, so you have to step over these areas.  The wiring is already in for the lighting and a lot of the areas are accessible without the crawl space.
3.  Question:  Are there new Occupancy Sensors (OC's) being installed?
Answer:  Yes, there are 5 listed under Item 2A and 5 under Item 2B.
4.  Question:  When will the project work occur?
Answer: It depends on how quickly bids are reviewed and contractor is selected.  The solicitation closes Nov 29th, it our goal that the award will be made and pre-con meeting schedule by Dec 3rd.
5.  Question:  Are the Exit signs being replaced?
Answer:  Yes, there are 11 in the bid schedule.
6.  Question:  Are charging systems being replaced?  
Answer: As shown in the bid schedule, not the fixtures, but the batteries and backups are.
7.  Question:  The solicitation says installed, is that correct?
Answer: Yes, the solicitation is correct.
8.  Question:  What hours will the building be accessible?
Answer: Maintenance typically opens the building at 6am.  The building is open to the public 9am-5pm.  The gate is usually opened at 8:30am but we could work something out for getting materials/equipment delivered earlier than that.
9.  Question:  Is the contractor responsible for disposal of materials?
Answer:  The government will be responsible for disposal of material.
10.  Question:  Is the goal of the project to get Oregon Tax Credits?
Answer: No, the federal government does not pay state tax, but the goal is energy use reduction.
11.  Question:  What types of fixtures do the 16-T8 lights require?Answer:  The fixtures are not being replaced, just the ballasts.
12.  Question:  How many recessed can lights are being replaced, and what type are they?
Answer: The compact fluorescents are staying; just the halogen bulbs are to be replaced, the 2-pin 50watt, like the MR-16's.
13.  Question:  On page 6, it says 16 fixtures are to be designed and installed, Item 4, is that correct?
Answer:  No, this needs to be corrected.  However, until corrected, as stated previously, what is listed in the solicitation is what should be used as a basis for bids.
14.  Question:  What is the load per circuit on the UPS's and how many circuits?  Answer: This question was asked during the walkthrough and the answer was not readily available.
15.  Question:  Is there a preference on light color?
Answer:  Yes, warm toned lighting.
16.  Question:  Is the lighting tied into security system?
Answer:  No.
17.  Question:  Confirming, not full blown UPS, just battery backup, Item 3B?
Answer: Yes.
18.  Question:  Item 4A is just battery ballast, not bulbs?
Answer:  Yes.
19.  Question:  Occupancy sensors in staff hall-replace all lights?  
Answer: We see how the wording could be confusing on this, see changes.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, Commercial and Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the U.S. EPA requires a commercially available ?off-the-shelf? of a Fourier Infrared Transform Spectrometer (FTIR) Zero Air Monitor, with installation and commissioning.  A variety of emissions regulations have been implemented for vehicles and engines as part of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments. The EPA National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) has the responsibility for testing vehicles and engines to ensure compliance with these regulations. As part of that testing, NVFEL uses high purity gases that need to be monitored to ensure compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations specifications for vehicle testing.  The EPA seeks to purchase a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer to monitor and quantitate impurities in the purified air system.  The instrument will be dedicated to the analysis of high purity gases. The primary function will be to monitor the pur ified air, but other high purity gases will occasionally be analyzed.
As part of this requirement the Contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include all phases of the project, design/configuration, assembly, integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation and training of EPA staff.  The Contractor shall be responsible for documenting measurement traceability and system acceptance in a manner suitable for audit to ISO 17025 standards.  The Instrument shall be a bench top unit, dedicated to the analysis of gases and must be configured to readily accept sample gas lines.  Michelson type interferometer and factory set components.  Sixty meter path length cell with bare gold coated mirrors and ZnSe windows.  Scan range shall be at least 5000 cm-1 to 500 cm-1, with the lowest selectable spectral resolution of 0.5 cm-1 or better.  The Instrument shall have an InSb liquid nitrogen cooled detector.  The Instrument shall meet the following detection  limits: 1.0 ppb for CO, CO2, H2O, CH4, and total hydrocarbons.  Dry air or nitrogen purge and an oil free diaphragm pump shall be included as an additional component to evacuate the system.  The Instrument shall interface to a PC with a Microsoft Windows based operating system.   Shall meet ISO 17025 standards, with calibration certificates for all measuring transducers.  The Contractor shall provide the operation manual and the maintenance manual for the instrument and any accessories.  A CD-ROM version of the operation manual is acceptable.
This procurement is being conducted with full and open competitive procedures under NAICS code 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Award will be made using ?Best Value? evaluation criteria.  The solicitation will be released through the internet on EPA?s home page at www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.  The solicitation will also be released through www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedconnect.net. The anticipated solicitation release date is approximately 10 calendar days after the electronic posting date of this notice.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be provided.  Interested parties may contact Annette Niedermier, in writing, via fax (734) 214-4569 or email at niedermier.annette@epa.gov with questions.

Please submit your response based on the information provided.<br /><br />H-65 Radar Replacement; Request for Information.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard is looking for sources/vendors capable of providing a replacement for the H-65 RADAR system. This solicitation has been issued to survey the market to identify suitable candidate systems for consideration. The Coast Guard is seeking an affordable replacement RADAR system for weather avoidance that will also detect small targets at sea. The attached document provides interface data and performance objectives for the H-65 replacement RADAR.

Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. All companies that can meet the specification are encouraged to provide a capability statement, company literature, brochures, or any other information that demonstrates that the specification can be met.</p>
<p>Telephone responses will not be accepted. Responses must be received no later than 03 December 2010 at 3 p.m. EST.</p>
