<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture(USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with Illinois officials, requires three (3) firm-fixed price requirements contracts for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) within the State of Illinois.  The first contract will cover the Chicago area, the second and third contract will cover Park Ridge (for Ravenwood with Damen Avenue as the east/west dividing line).  The application is intended to reduce the potential for damage from this major pest of trees.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza and London Plane.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture had declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  This spring, APHIS anticipates treating an estimated 86,301 (+- 20%) trees and an estimated total DBH of 968,879 (+/- 20%) inches, as follow:

Chicago, West Ravenswood:  23,240 trees at 329,824 total DBH by soil injection
				   5,292 trees at   42,345 total DBH by trunk injection
Chicago, East Ravenswood:   23,830 trees at 319,017 total DBH by soil injection
				  1,178 trees at   14,589 total DBH by trunk injection
Park Ridge, Forest Preserve:  31,780 trees at 246,626 total DBH by trunk injection
Park Ridge, Residential Area:     981 trees at   16,478 total DBH by trunk injection.  The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about January 20, 2004, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer 3 weeks thereafter.  The effective period of the contract will be from date of award through September 30, 2004.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS BY FAX IS PROHIBITED.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUBZone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAICS Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average annual receipts.  Interested companies may download the RFP on or about January 20, 2004, at the following internet address:  http:www.aphis.usda.gov/mpls/contracts/cbd.html.  Telephone requests for a copy of the RFP will not be honored.

Organizations that believe they are capable of performing the described work may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort IN WRITING to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 1/21/04. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	 A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. This is NOT a competitive announcement; it is a sole source announcement.  Please do not request a copy of the solicitation-- No competitive solicitation will be issued as a sole result of this announcement.  If the Government decides that this work will be competed, a competitive announcement and/or solicitation will be issued at that time.

Interested firms may respond by bringing their cover letter and completed Business Declaration form to the Tempe workshop on January 13th. ï‚· The January 13th workshop is mandatory only for those  design firms who have an interest in competing on the first project, which will be a design-only effort in the Phoenix area.  Other design firms (not interested in this first project), and those firms providing construction and/or design-build services, will have opportunities to attend workshops in the future as other projects develop.  However, these firms are welcome to attend the morning session of the Tempe workshop to get a preview of the new FAA construction delivery process. ï‚· Firms are requested to RSVP by e-mailing John Lippe at john.a.lippe@faa.gov. FAA PIPS Workshop January 13, 2004, Tempe, Arizona Content: This workshop will cover a test process to be used to procure design and construction services.  The new process is the Performance Information Procurement System (PIPS.)  This process maximizes the value to the owner (FAA) and also maximizes the profit of the construction services.  The new process results in less risk, higher performance, and larger profits for the vendors due to the increase in efficiency of the system. PIPS favors designers and constructors who can deliver best value on time, on budget, and meet the expectations of the FAA and their internal customer, ATB.  This process does not guaranty the award to the lowest offeror, but to the highest value within the budget.  This workshop is mandatory for designers who want to participate in the competition of the design of a $5-$10M construction project. The design process is being modified to be more efficient.  The process will maximize the potential profit of the vendors.  The method of delivery and the selection mechanism will be performance based.  The FAA encourages all designers who are interested in designing the first project to attend this mandatory workshop.  Other design firms (not interested in this first project), and constructors and/or design-build firms are also invited to the morning session, although it is not mandatory. Meeting Location: Arizona State University (Main Campus) Tempe, AZ Building Name: Murdock Hall Room Number: 201  (Map is attached below) Schedule: Tuesday, January 13, 2004 9:00am â€“ 12:00pm:  General Information Session (FAA/ATB requirements & PIPS overview) 12:00pm â€“ 1:30pm:  Lunch 1:30pm â€“ 4:00pm:  Designer Educational Meeting (Designers only)

These Forest Highways are not included in the scope of this PWS.  There are approximately 45 miles of paved and 247 miles of aggregate and natural soil system roads. In addition there are approximately 50 miles of cemetery and 22 miles of interior facility roads. Of LBL’s 357 miles of trails, approximately 100 miles receive intermittent maintenance; the other 257 miles receive infrequent maintenance.  The roads and trails are a combination of bituminous paved, gravel, and native material.  Refer to Attachment 12 - ROAD INVENTORY and Attachment 13 - TRAILS for more detailed information on specific roads or trails.  Work on roads and trails will include, but not limited to cleaning ditches; surface grading; roadside spraying of herbicides; mowing; culvert cleaning, replacement, and installation; reshaping gravel surfaces, ditches, and slopes; erosion control; spot surfacing; total resurfacing; pothole repair; pavement patching; bituminous pavement resurfacing; erecting and replacing signs; tree and limb removal; snow and ice removal; traffic control; guard rail, gate, and barrier installation and repair; bridge repair and installation; and pavement striping.

Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO), through NASA-Ames Research Center, is initiating a new program focused on revolutionizing the current method of designing helicopter rotor blades thereby enabling the creation of novel rotor blade designs that can dramatically reduce the acoustic signature of a helicopter without sacrificing flight performance.  The focus on the first phase of program is to create physics-based design tools that can predict performance regardless of blade shape.  The purpose is to enable virtual testing of a wide variety of designs from unususal tips to movable flaps or slats or other innovative ideas.  Subsequent phases of the program are anticipated to concentrate on developing, testing, and transitioning an advanced low noise blade design developed using the new design tools. NASA anticipates the issuance of up to four contracts for this work.  All data first developed, including design tools and other contract deliverables required under these contracts shall be the property of the Government. For more program information see:	 http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/HQ/index.htm	 . DARPA has scheduled a Proposer's Day for 14 January 2004.

The Government intends to award without discussion. This acquisition is anticipated to be solicited as a partial Small Business Set-Aside.  (NAICS 541710 (Aircraft Systems Development))  All contractors (including small business contractors) need to perform the full breadth of work. Six (6) indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, task/delivery order type contracts are under contemplation, with task/delivery orders issued as either completion or term form, to be determined prior to task/delivery order award.  The Government intends to use multiple delivery order contract types under this effort including, but not limited to, cost-reimbursement, firm fixed-price, and time and materials.  The period of performance is composed of a six (6) year base period and three (3), 3-year options to extend the term of the contract.

The tentative contract award date is 1 December 2003. The Government anticipates that four (4) delivery orders will be released at the same time as the basic RFP.  The individual Request for Proposal Delivery Orders (RFPDOs) will provide, at a minimum, a statement of objectives, requirements documents and anticipated contract type.  In order to satisfy minimum ordering requirements, the Government intends on awarding each winning contractor with one delivery order estimated to be at least $250,000.00 worth of meaningful work.  The three (3) remaining delivery orders will be competed among the winning contractors and awarded in accordance with FAR 16.505(b), the fair opportunity process.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command anticipates issuing a solicitation for the procurement of an Enhanced Grenade Launcher Module (EGLM).  This current synopsis/solicitation number replaces previous Commercial Area Announcements N00164-04-R-4801 and N00164-03-R-0063 utilized for market research purposes. The program will use full and open competition to fulfill the joint USSOCOM EGLM requirement. The EGLM will be a one for one replacement to the M203 Grenade Launcher with Leaf Sight and AN/PSQ-18A Grenade Launcher Sight.  

The EGLM is a single shot, 40mm grenade launcher module that can be attached to a MIL-STD-1913 dimensioning rail interface on host weapons and can be adaptable to a yet undetermined interface system that may possibly replace the MIL-STD-1913 rail at the 6 o’clock position on the host weapon. The EGLM shall consist of two primary components, the weapon module and fire control module.  It will also have a major accessory, an ancillary butt-stock assembly.  The EGLM mounting system will accommodate most current and future Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) accessories that support the host weapon mission.  

The EGLM also detaches from the host weapon to attach to an EGLM butt-stock assembly to accommodate stand-alone firing.  The EGLM shall provide the Special Operator with improved combat lethality and other capabilities, when compared to the current M79 and the M203 with Leaf Sight and AN/PSQ-18A Grenade Launcher Sight.  The EGLM program has four sequential increments.  This synopsis is for Increment 1 with the possibility of reaching Increment II. The Increment I weapon fire control modules shall be inherently upgradeable to incorporate technology advances to satisfy requirements for Increment 2 (programmable munitions capability).  The EGLM fires standard 40mm x 46mm munitions along with special Low Velocity (LV) munitions.  

Further, the EGLM shall operate in compliance with specifications to be published, to include, but not limited to:

Accuracy: The EGLM system shall have a Probability of hit of at least .25 greater than an M203 with an AN/PSQ-18A.  A hit is defined as a projectile landing within 5 meters of a designated point target. 

Target Engagement:  The EGLM system shall allow operators to fire projectiles capable of engaging infantry squad targets at unknown ranges between 25 and at least 300 meters.  A successful engagement is defined as a projectile landing within 5 meters of a designated point target.   The EGLM system shall allow operators to fire projectiles capable of engaging stationary vehicle/bunker targets at unknown ranges to at least 300 meters.  A successful engagement is defined as a projectile landing within 5 meters of a designated target. 

Ranging Capabilities:  Provide for a method of target ranging that allows operators to determine range out to 600 meters, with error not to exceed +/- 5m, during day, night, and limited visibility.

Operator Firing Positions, Conditions, And Equipment: The EGLM design shall permit the operator full operational capability from the prone, kneeling, sitting, and standing positions.  The EGLM design shall allow operators the ability to operate the weapon with body armor/load carrying systems (BALCS), Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) ensembles, dive suit ensembles, and arctic clothing ensembles. 

Amphibious Operations. The EGLM should function in an amphibious environment with minimum preparation, and must undergo immersion testing at 20.1 meters of depth (66 feet) for 2 hours.  The EGLM shall function in amphibious operations when Special Operators are moving from the beach and surf zone onto land. 

Airborne/Airmobile Operations: Operators will be capable of operating the EGLM following static line, fast rope, and military free fall insertions. 

Over-the-Beach (OTB): The EGLM will have a safe drain time/drain procedure that operators can execute in less than 3 seconds.  

Extreme Environments:  The EGLM should function in extreme environments, such as desert, arctic, jungle, mountain, and riverine. The system shall withstand transport, in an un-packaged configuration, in the back of flat bed wheeled vehicles or inside of Armored Personnel Carriers traveling over rugged terrain.  

Urban Conditions:  The EGLM shall function effectively in Military Operations Urban Terrain (MOUT) combat settings. The EGLM shall allow soldiers to engage the enemy at street level, on rooftops, inside window and doors, and behind fence lines. 

Set-Up, Assembly and Disassembly:  The EGLM shall allow 5 to 95% of trained operators to assemble (or disassemble) the EGLM to the host weapon or Stock Assembly in the time periods to be specified in the solicitation. 

Tools:  The operator must be able to attach the EGLM without the use of Special Tools to install/remove the EGLM to/from the host weapon or to/from the butt-stock assembly. 

Installation and Removal:  EGLM system should allow operators to install/remove the EGLM weapon from the EGLM M4A1 Interface and EGLM Stock Assembly in complete darkness. 





Offerors will be required to provide product sample EGLM as part of the technical proposal. The product samples will consist of 1 each EGLM (Weapon Module, Fire Control Module, Ancillary Butt-stock).  After evaluation, the government will have the flexibility to award one or more contracts for follow-on test/evaluation quantities. The contract type will be a seven-year, Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ). The minimum quantity is projected to be 5 each EGLM Engineering Test Units (ETU’s). The government will conduct tests and evaluations of the test units. The results of those tests and evaluations may result in subsequent delivery orders for additional test samples.  The Government seeking a full system, however the Government may determine that a complete EGLM system from one vendor is not in the best interest of the government, and reserves the right to award contracts(s) for only Weapon Modules (and not the Fire Control Modules), or, for only Fire Control Modules (and not Weapon Modules). 

QUANTITIES AND DELIVERY SCHEDULES:  The contract(s) maximum is 5,586 each EGLM’s. The contract will contain a Provisioning Item Order (PIO) contract line item number (CLIN) of $2,000,000.  The contract will also have provisions for ordering technical data.  The programmable pathway data necessary to develop programmable munitions and all interface rights shall be made available to the Government for the establishment of a MILSPEC or other interface control document. The contract is F.O.B. Destination (NAVSEA Crane – Crane,- IN). For the minimum quantities delineated above, the delivery of the initial 5 ETU’s is required 90 days after order. Subsequent deliveries of additional ETU’s, if required by the Government, will also require deliveries 90 days after order. The delivery schedule for Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units is 180 days after order. The ordering quantities for the remaining production units during the Full-Rate Production Stage (FRP) shall be 180 days for each 500 units order. 

PROPOSALS:  The solicitation will require at minimum, delivery of 1/ea EGLM product sample and a concise technical proposal by the closing date of the proposal. The proposals and product samples will be evaluated on a best value basis.   The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced offeror and other than the highest technically rated offeror. The technical proposal shall provide a clear plan, with drawings and process descriptions, to remedy any known specification deficiencies in the product samples submitted. Product sample(s) submitted become the property of the Government and will not be returned to the contactor.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All offerors are responsible for monitoring the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://fedbizopps.gov/ for release of the upcoming solicitation and any notices. Any questions may be directed in writing, to the following: Johnson_p@crane.navy.mil or addressed directly to Paul R. Johnson at (812) 854-3225.

The government requires delivery of the system by no later than 15 March 2004 and training to commence no later than 24 March 2004. NSWC Indian Head is conducting an urgent procurement for a digital x-ray system for the evaluation of various five-inch diameter rocket motors.  This system includes; cabinetry of a specific size and compliant with 21CFR1020.40, a Varian 4030, high voltage, premium DR plate with workstation and software, and a complete x-ray source (to include tube-head, generators, cooler and controller).  The vendor is to obtain assemble and test this system at their location, disassemble the system and ship F.O.B. Destination to NSWC Indian Head. The system will be reassembled by Indian Head personnel and must comply with the above CFR.  21CFR1020.40 guides the design, fabrication and assembly of this system.  Cabinetry - This is a component sy stem in which a shuttered tube cabinet (this shuttered cabinet is currently under construction and to be provided to the awardee as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) within 4 weeks after award of this contract) is placed on top of a center cabinet to which are attached to two end cabinets.  Both the center and end cabinets have an internal frame of 2” x 1/4” square tubing.  This framework will hold the material handling tracks, etc.  Thus, the threshold of the openings in the sides of both the end cabinets and the center cabinet must lie flush with this framework.  The contractor shall be responsible for integrating and certifying the entire system to include GFE in compliance with 21CFR1020.40.  Each cabinet must be movable via a forklift.  The center cabinet does not have to support the tube cabinet.  Sketch of the assembled cabinets will be e-mail upon request.   The c enter cabinet shall meet the following specifications: &#61623; Outside dimensions of cabinet (LWH) which will be approximately  32”x 34”x 48”. The height will vary to achieve the source to detector distance as specified below. The hinged door is on a 32” face. &#61623; 420 keV (3800 Rad @1m) will enter the cabinet through the top.  Thus, the base is a primary barrier and the four sides are each a secondary barrier. &#61623; NO leakage through the solid parts of the cabinet shall exceed 0.5mR/hr (21 CFR 1020.40 compliant) &#61623; Basically a box, the base of which is the primary barrier (sketch to be provided upon request)  &#61623; Supported at the corners by 3” square table legs (not being procured under this contract). &#61623; Provision to move the box with a fork lift is required &#61623; All openings are 18” square.  Opening in top may be reduced to accommodate  collimator. &#61623; Internal frame of 2”x 1/4” sq. tube   &#61623; NO fasteners through the lead (Pb) of the external wall.  Bolts are used to attach the end cabinet to the center cabinet. &#61623; One latchable door (with interlocks) on front of cabinet as shown above. &#61623; The opening in the top is centered therein, and collimated to produce an 18” square image size on the primary barrier. &#61623; The surface of the digital detector is 5” above the surface of the primary barrier.  The height of the cabinet MUST be adjusted to produce an 48” source to detector distance.  (Source is 6” above the top of this cabinet.) &#61623; The height from the inside (from the top of the base to the bottom (threshold) of the three openings in the sides and front) is 2”.  Thus the 2” sq. tube frame is flush with the bottom of the openings in the sides and front of the cabinet. T he end cabinets shall meet the following specifications: &#61623; The units shall be identical with doors fixtured in mirrored configuration &#61623; Each cabinet shall be 96” long by 30” wide by 30” deep &#61623; Lead (Pb) thickness shall be 0.75” or that sufficient to comply with 21 CFR 1020.40 &#61623; The internal frame shall be completed of 2” x 1/4” square tubing &#61623; An 18” square opening in the center of the top, covered by a bolt-on door &#61623; An 18” square opening in both ends, centered side to side, with its threshold flush with the internal frame &#61623; One end of the cabinet will attach to the center cabinet.  An automatic track mount door will cover the other end &#61623; An automated door assembly including the door, rails, stepper motor, and interlocks must be mounted to this other end of the cabinet. Source - This system will be used in an  industrial production application.  The system is expected to operate an average of 12 hours a day.  This system is expected to examine a very broad range of munitions.  Thus, the tube output will be adjusted several times, though not more than five, a shift.  The range of these adjustments will be from 100 keV through 420 keV with the mA kept fairly close to the maximum allowable.  The contractor shall provide a standard control console which operates in parallel with the PC user interface. The contractor shall supply a Comet MXR-420/25 x-ray tube. The contractor shall also provide a description of the electrical services (e.g., a dedicated 30 AMP 220 Volt circuit) required by the system. Digital Detector - Ease of operation is a priority.  The digital detector must meet the following specifications: &#61623; Tolerate 3800R/hr for a 12 hour workday (420 keV at max m A) &#61623; Detector will be a Varian  “premium grade” High Voltage 4030 DR plate &#61623; Provide a PC, monitor, and software (Varian basic software is sufficient) that allows the operator to perform pass/fail decisions in real time The offeror shall provide a one-year ‘parts and labor’ guarantee.

<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, Rhode Island (NUWCDIVNPT)  needs to modify the REVERB system to provide the capability to process analog inputs generated from other analog sources in REVERB’s operational environment, and to replay the analog inputs in WAV format for use with other systems.  The REVERB system is an acoustic playback and analysis system.  The REVERB program recently utilized an Interactive Circuits and Systems Ltd. (ICS) board and connector from the CLUSTER HOUND system in the REVERB system and determined in testing that the ICS board would provide the required analog input capabilities.  There are nine REVERB systems in need of this capability, and NUWCDIVNPT wishes to purchase nine ICS boards for the systems, plus one spare ICS board, as well as the analog connectors for each board.  Use of another board and connector would require repeat of the testing, and unlike architecture between CLUSTER HOUND and REVERB for system users.  NUWCDIVNPT requires delivery of two ICS boards and connectors in February 2004 and two units per month thereafter with final delivery in June 2004.  There will be no formal solicitation issued for this procurement. NAICS: 334119.  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION REPLACES NAR030061A. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for hazardous fuels management (fuels reduction) services to treat vegetation to reduce the risk of wildland fires.  Possible states that may utilize contracts resulting from the solicitation include Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, and Texas.  It is anticipated that multiple awards will be issued for each state.  Project areas are reforestation areas, natural and managed stands of timber of all ages, size, and species, shrub fields, or grass areas.  Fuels will consist of harvest activity slash, natural fuels, live fuels, and slashed shrubs and trees.  Fuel loadings range from less than one half  ton per acre to as high as 100 tons or more per acre.  Treatments such as brushing, chipping, piling, fuel break construction, and prescribed fire have been shown to reduce the risk of wildland fire and the severity of fires that do occur.  The objective is to treat fuels present on units identified to reduce fuel loading and optimize the treatment of those fuels to the most effective burning period.  The services are designed to provide for wildfire hazard reduction, prescribed burning and mop-up, and related services.  This may require vegetation manipulation, burn unit preparation, prescribed burning and mop-up in compliance with its terms, specifications and provisions.  This may include Contractor formulating and preparing written burn plans for submission and approval by the ordering agency, determining when specific burn units are within prescription parameters through field checks of fuel moistures percentages; providing all required crew members, supervision and making all prescribed burn operational decisions ranging from determining that site specific unit conditions are within approved burn plan parameters, through ignition and holding operations, mop-up and patrol until released by the Contracting Officer's Representative.  This may include furnishing labor, supervision, transportation, operating supplies, and incidentals to perform all work necessary to conduct slashing, girdling, lop and scatter, selective slashing, pruning, fuel modification zone construction, hand piling and cover, prescribed fire plan preparation, fire line construction and maintenance, fuels pullback, prescribed burning and mop-up, additional mop-up, sang felling, roadblock removal/restoration, requested holding and mop-up. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115310.  The solicitation will be available on or about January 7, 2004.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB), plans to procure BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation testing with Myriad Genetic Laboratories, Inc., 320 Wakara Way, Salt Lake City, Utah 84108.  The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB) is engaged in ongoing clinical genetics study of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer. CGB has a need to obtain complete sequencing of the two-breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility genes known as BRCA1 and BRCA2 as part of these research projects. In addition, the CGB has a need for mutation testing, which targets the three Ashkenazi founder BRCA mutations, and for single mutation testing in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 in selected individuals.  Finally, CGB has a need for molecular testing for the presence of large deletions in the BRCA genes, which have been recently recognized as important contributors to hereditary breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility. The samples were derived from individuals who are members of families in which these two cancers have occurred with unusual frequency. These studies are part of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, intramural research program within DCEG=s Human Genetics Program, which is focused upon elucidation of the entire spectrum of scientific and clinical issues related to familial and hereditary forms of cancer.  The current acquisition represents an extension of prior work done for the Government by Myriad Genetics, under a Memorandum of Understanding executed between the provider and the National Cancer Institute in November 1999.  The purpose of the MOU is to facilitate performance of these complex assays in support on NCI-sponsored clinical cancer genetics research.  Under a previous purchase order number, NCI CGB submitted 80 DNA samples to Myraid Genetics for germline BRCA1/2 mutation testing.  In addition, the CGB has the potential for requiring BRCA1/2 sequencing of a relatively large number of samples, project designated GOG -0199 (NCI-02-C-0268), which is a national cohort study of women at increased genetic risk of ovarian cancer.  Many of these subjects will have at this time, through out the contract, undergone clinical BRCA1/2 mutation testing.   In these subjects, the decision may be made to submit their DNA to Myriad as part of this current research protocol of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer.  This information is vital to the research that is currently ongoing.   Period of Performance: Base Year: upon award through twelve (12) months, with four (4), twelve (12) month option renewals if exercised; FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to extend service (November 1999) and FAR Clause 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (March 2000) apply.  The requirement will be an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type order. Myriad Genetic Laboratories, Inc. is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the assay results for a large number of DNA samples derived from participants in ongoing clinical research studies. In order to insure comparability of subsequent assay results with those already performed, the current procurement is proposed as a sole source acquisition.  Failure to do so could invalidate the cornerstone of these important research projects, i.e., the accurate, timely and reliable classification of study participants with regard to their BRCA1/2 germline mutation status. Myriad Genetics owns the patents on both the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes, and thus is the only commercial vendor available to perform the required work.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above supplies, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EST (local Washington D.C. time) on January 22, 2004.  If you have questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail   holdcram@excange.nih.gov or by fax at (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>Requirements for contracted security guards at Mount Rushmore National Memorial:NAICS:561612 P&S:S206 This is being conducted using the rules of Commercial Item to determine the Best Value for the Government Far 12. During periods of elevated threats, heightened security, or major special events, the National Park Service at Mount Rushmore National Memorial might occasionally require the use of privately contracted security to supplement NPS law enforcement and security.  The objective is to best protect public safety and valuable resources.  The primary use of the contracted security service would be to provide visitor screening including operating magnetometer portals and hand held magnetometers.  The NPS will provide the equipment.  The security guard(s) would be responsible for greeting visitors in a friendly and professional manner, briefly explaining the procedure if necessary, observing as visitors pass through magnetometers, followup searches with hand held magnetometers or physical checks as appropriate, and searches of possessions including all bags, packs, purses, and packages.  Significant issues or problems will immediately be referred to NPS law enforcement personnel.  In addition to operating visitor screening stations, it is possible that private security guards would assist park staff with vehicle screening or posted guarding at buildings or facilities. Security Guard Qualifications:  Security Guards must be uniformed and identifiable, including a name badge.  Uniforms and personal grooming must present a neat and professional appearance.  Any facial hair must be neatly trimmed.  Uniform hats or caps will be worn if working outdoors, but not indoors.  Security Guards must be well trained and qualified to operate magnetometer portals and hand held magnetometers.  Security Guards must be trained and able to recognize firearms, explosives, other weapons, or objects that may represent a threat to people and resources.  Security Guards must be trained to handle potentially threatening situations, including care for their personal safety and protection and to immediately report potential problems or dangers to NPS law enforcement personnel.  Security Guards must not have any felony convictions or record of violations or convictions that indicates a potential threat to people or resources or a pattern of disregard for the law.  Security Guards are subject to background checks at the discretion of the NPS and the results of those checks must be favorable and not include felony convictions, serious violations that may represent a threat, or patterns of violations. Security Guards will operate the visitor screening station during hours set by the National Park Service.  Hours will vary by time of year and patterns of visitation.  The number of guards required will be determined by the National Park Service, from a minimum of one during slow periods to ten or more during busy times.  The use of guards may  begin and end on very short notice if the NPS so determines or the National Homeland Security Threat Level is lowered.   The National Park Service will require a specific number of guards to be on duty at any given time.  This may vary with time of day and season of the year.  If lunch breaks, rest breaks, smoke breaks, etc, are required, they will be closely coordinated with the NPS for timing and the NPS will not be billed for break times. No smoking is allowed in any government buildings or vehicles.  No smoking by Security Guards will be allowed in public view while on duty or in uniform.  If smoking breaks occur, they must be out of sight of the public and the time will not be charged for to the NPS. Contrctor should complete a detailed proposal with pricing for the performance periods indicated in the solicitation and complete an experience questionnaire that will accompany the solicitation and will be evaluated on Experience, Past Performance and Price. FAILURE TO COMPLETE EXPERIENCE QUESTIONNAIRE WILL RENDER YOUR PROPOSAL NON-RESPONISIVE!

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The US Army intends to procure 364 brackets, NSN 5855-01-172-1788, and the installation thereof using the Infrared optical alignment procedures for the OR-336 180-element, detector cooler dewar assemblies, the heart of the Apache Forward Looking Infr ared System (FLIR).  This solicitation will be issued to limited sources that are currently qualified to perform these procedures.  Currently, the only contractors qualified to compete for this procurement are DRS Technologies and  Lockheed Martin.  They maintain the only calibrated and operational facilities that can perform the Infrared optical alignment procedure.  This procedure requires  familiarity with infrared detector cooler assemblies and the Infrared /optical alignment of the assemblies for integration into the utilizing system.  If the contractor has not performed this procedure within the last year, they are not considered a qualif ied or proven producer and would be required to successfully complete first article testing requirements, which could take up to one year or longer.  The Government requires a delivery rate of at least 40 units monthly beginning in May 2004 to a facility l ocated in Orlando, Florida, until completion of all contracted quantities.  The Government does not own the complete technical data package to detail the manufacture of the item, testing of the item or the development of the required optical table and alig nment procedures.  This limited source acquisition is authorized under 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1.  Point of Contact is Ellen Widelitz, 732-446-6650, E-mail address, ellen.widelitz@us.army.mil.

<DESC>The New England District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been tasked by the Department of Homeland Security (former Immigration and Naturalization Service INS) to design and construct two new replacement Border Patrol Stations on the northern Maine  border, one each in Calais (Baileyville) and Jackman, Maine. These new Border Patrol Stations are required to accommodate future staff increases and are intended to replace existing stations.  Sites have been selected. In Calais, the new Border Patrol Sta tion will be constructed in the Baileyville Industrial Park on Route 1 and in Jackman, the new Border Patrol Station will be constructed on Route 6/15 in Jackman.  It is expected that construction for this project will begin during the early summer of 2004  with construction completion scheduled for one year later  early summer of 2005. Occupancy by the Border Patrol is required by mid march 2005. Because of this, a winter shutdown is not envisioned as this work must be accomplished on schedule. The Corps of  Engineers will be performing construction management services for this contract.  Work to be done hereunder includes furnishing of all labor, equipment and materials, to perform all work required for the construction of two new Border Patrol Stations as i ndicated in the plans and specifications. Each Border Patrol Station will be constructed on a minimum 10-acre site and will consist of an approximately minimum 10,000 sf commercial building with options that could potentially double the building size. The Border Patrol Stations will be constructed on wooded lots and will be slab on grade office buildings complete with systems furniture designed to operate 24 hours per day and will include enclosed dog kennels; backup generator; trash dumpster; security syst ems to include fencing; gasoline storage/dispensing; heating oil storage; and flag pole. The main building will be CMU with brick facade and gabled roof with asphalt roof shingles. With favorable contract bids, bid options may include a combination of the following: enclosed parking garage for vehicles including a wash bay, ATVs, motorcycles and snowmobiles; enclosed sally port; enclosed ASU parking; enclosed vehicle maintennance bay; a helicopter pad (Jackman); and enclosed marine bay (Calais). The constru ction of a water well and septic systems will be required at Jackman. Town water and sewer is available at Calais (Baileyville). The extension of three phase electricity to the Jackman site will be required. It is avaialble at Calais. The remote locations of these proposed Border Patrol Stations, the extreme winter weather conditions, and the expedited construction completion requirements are of the utmost concern that must be accounted for by prospective contractors. Work will be required during the winter  in order to meet the schedule. The estimated issue date is on or about January 21, 2004.  The proposed action is unrestricted.  The NAICS code is 236220 with a size standard of $28.5 million.  No paper copies of the solicitation or amendments will be avai lable. The firms interested must register to receive the solicitation.  Registration instructions are available on the Internet at http://www.nae.usace.army.mil as well as the media by which the solicitation will be made available.  Amendments, if any, to this solicitation will be made available at this Internet site.  Neither telephonic, mailed nor fax requests will be accepted.  Those registering are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the registration list.  All responsible sources may sub mit a bid, which will be considered by the New England District.

<RESPDATE>050304
<ARCHDATE>10012004
<CONTACT>Nancy Williamson,321-494-1795
<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION  NOTICE 1.  The Aeronautical Systems Center Reconnaissance System Program Office  (ASC/RA) seeks proposals from offerors to perform Phase 3 of the United States  National Data Center (US NDC) program.  The focus of Phase 3 is to operate and  sustain the present operational systems, increase performance by fine-tuning  current systems, and add increased functionality to the current baseline. 2.  The US NDC is an advanced geophysical data processing system that provides  the capability to receive, process, archive, and report events of interest in  monitoring nuclear treaty requirements.  It acquires waveform data from a  global network of seismic, hydroacoustic, and infrasonic stations.  Data is  stored, distributed to researchers both internal and external, and reliably  forwarded to a classified processing system.  The US NDC receives data from  multiple sources, including from the United States Atomic Energy Detection  System (USAEDS) networks, from the International Data Center (IDC), and from  other countries via bilateral agreements.  Users interactively review, refine,  and correct, the results of data processing. 3.  The US NDC consists of two parallel operational systems:  the US NDC at  Patrick AFB and the Alternate US NDC at Goodfellow AFB.  The Alternate US NDC  system operates continuously, and it becomes the primary system if the US NDC  becomes inoperative.  A third system, the US NDC Testbed, is used to evaluate  and test new functionality.  There is also a stand-alone Training System used  by Air Education and Training Command (AETC) for training system operators.   The primary and testbed systems are classified systems located at Patrick AFB  FL.  The alternate and training systems are located at Goodfellow AFB TX. 4.  Current system parameters include: 4.1.  Hardware:  SUN ULTRA 10, 6800/4800 series servers, and  Blade servers/workstations  (The hardware is and will continue to be maintained  through a separate contract.) 4.2.  Software:  Solaris 8, Oracle 8I 4.3.  Code: C++, C, Fortran, Java, Perl, Scheme 5.  The selected contractor shall provide Total System Integration  Responsibility (TSIR) for the US NDC system (primary, alternate, testbed,  training).  Contractor tasks will include the sustainment of the system  hardware and software, continuing development and integration of system  upgrades following a spiral development model, training, and performing  advanced geophysical studies. 6.  All upgrades to the US NDC shall be tested on the US NDC testbed.  Upon  government acceptance, all changes shall then be implemented on the primary,  the alternate, and the training systems. 7.  The majority of the work will be in support of the Patrick AFB FL system.   Key personnel must provide on-site support at Patrick AFB. 8.  The contractor will be required to provide 24 hours per day/7 days per  week/365 days per year on-call trouble-shooting support. 9.  Geophysical expertise is a requirement. 10.  Work effort, to include sustainment and developmental work, to be  performed by the contractor includes but is not limited to: 10.1  Tuning/optimization of software algorithms.  Perhaps the most important  part of this effort will be the tuning of the signal detector, screening, and  event formation algorithms. 10.2  Expansion of the current Knowledge Base.  This effort will expand the  depth and breadth of current geophysical knowledge and iterations of parametric  data, to include the additional optimization and tuning of such parametric data  by professional geophysicists. 10.3  Persistent, Shared, Processing Parameters and Recipes.  Data processing  parameter and recipe files shall be moved into the database and become dynamic. 10.4  Expansion of Spotlight Processing.  Geographically focused data  processing on an expanding number of areas with lower detection thresholds and  more sophisticated data processing. 10.5  Feature Extraction.  Numerous upgrades are required to  improve both automatic and interactive signal processing.  Examples include:   enhancements to frequency-wavenumber estimation to reduce the rate of false  rejection of valid signals, new types of measurements for magnitude and  classification, expansion of the filter library, and signal separation. 10.6  Moving initial phase identification from station processing to network  processing.   10.7  Association.  Detected signals are associated into common  events.  Improvement areas have been identified in terms of  making the network definition more dynamic and improving the sophistication of  the logic in the event formation process. 10.8  Magnitude.  Improvement areas have been identified for  automated and interactive coda magnitude, as well as the integration of unique  path and frequency dependent attenuation models. 10.9  Teaming for integration of third party efforts.  Various Air Force  partners, consisting of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Air  Force laboratories, and government contractors, are involved in numerous areas  of US NDC development.  Some examples of these areas:  portions of the  Knowledge Base, event classification methodology, and the Geographical  Information System (GIS).  The contractor will be responsible to team with  these Air Force partners and integrate their products into the US NDC.  The  contract will contain a requirement for the contractor to establish Associate  Contractor Agreements with the other government contractors to facilitate  accomplishment of this tasking.  10.10  Interactive analysis.  All functionality added to automated processing  must be integrated into interactive analysis.  The interactive software  currently lacks a universal "undo" and/or "revert to previous" functionality –  the implementation of which may involve fairly fundamental changes to the  software infrastructure and design. 10.11  Data services.  Tasks for improvements to data services include adding  primary/secondary sources of data acquisition for certain stations, adding  automatic data request management software to the US NDC (currently resides on  a separate local area network (LAN)), and adding various improvements to  existing software in the area of performance monitoring. 10.12  Hardware refresh. 11.  Schedule.  The contractor shall provide operation and sustainment of the  current system on a fiscal year (FY) basis beginning in late FY04 and  continuing through FY09.  Deliveries of spirals of development and integration  of system upgrades shall be in accordance with the schedule proposed by the  selected contractor but must be completed not later than the third quarter of  FY09. 12.  All personnel performing on the contract must have a Secret clearance, and  all key personnel must have a Top Secret Secure Compartmented Information (SCI)  clearance. 13.  No foreign contractor participation will be permitted at either the prime  contractor or subcontractor level. 14.  Proposals and Award.  Written proposals will be evaluated and a best value  decision made using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and FAR Supplement  Subpart 15.3, Source Selection, procedures.  Anticipated award date:  Jul 2004. 15.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered  by the Government. 16.  This procurement is unrestricted. 17.  An industry day is planned.  Date/time/location will be announced at a  later date.

<DESC>In an effort to improve war fighter support and to improve Air Force Weapon Systems sustainment, the Department of the Air Force has established Pathfinder Commodity Councils as part of the Purchasing and Supply Chain Management (PSCM) effort.  These councils were formed to develop enterprise-wide procurement strategies, integrate customers and suppliers, and drive commonality and standardization.   The Warner Robins Commodity Council has been tasked to develop a sourcing strategy for the 4920 Federal Stock Class (FSC) items. FSC 4920 is defined as Aircraft Maintenance and Repair Shop Specialized Equipment consisting of a diverse groups of items such as accessory kits, cable assemblies, calibration sets, control panels, electronic components, fixtures, engine heaters, maintenance stands, noise suppressors, etc. 

The purpose of this RFI is to identify industry best practices that would improve Air Force readiness, create better customer/ client relationships, reduce cost, and decrease administrative and production lead time.  In addition, we would like feedback regarding impediments and obstacles to doing business with the government.  The attached questionnaire is being provided as a means for the Government to gauge the industrial market climate, and gather recommended improvements to our current business practices.  Industry input into the strategy development process is critical for the Government to understand the supply base capabilities related to achieving the above objectives.  While we realize that our questionnaire is lengthy, we feel that these areas are critical to the development of a sustainment process that will achieve our objectives, and an acquisition strategy that will benefit both the government and the contracting community. 

The submission of this RFI is for informational purposes only.  No solicitations will be posted at this time.  Any resulting procurement action will be the subject of a separate, future announcement.  

The Warner Robins Logistics Center PSCM Commodity Council plans to host an Industry day specifically geared for FSC 4920.   The Industry Day is tentatively scheduled for the 27 and 28 January 2004.  Your response to these questions will be critical in determining how we can best formulate the commodity groupings.  Your responses will also assist us in setting up individual breakout sessions in order to achieve more meaningful discussions.   WHILE THE QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PROVIDE BELOW FOR YOUR REVIEW, PLEASE COMPLETE THE QUESTIONNAIRE THROUGH OUR WEB SITE ESTABLISHED AS http://www.robins.af.mil/logistics/PSCM/survey/index.asp NOT LATER THAN 9 JAN 04.  THE WEBSITE IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND WILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER 31 DEC 03.   We would greatly appreciate and encourage a response before the 9 Jan 04 deadline date.


 	Industry Day Questionnaire 4920 Purchasing and Supply Chain ManagementPathfinders	

The Purchasing and Supply Chain Management Pathfinders are part of the Air Force transformation process to discover and implement industry best practices within the Air Force.  We are trying to establish a better understanding of the commercial marketplace and business practices to enter into strategic partnerships with industry.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY
Explosives Detection Systems For Break Bulk Air Cargo Inspection

The Transportation Security Administration’s (TSA’s) Office of Security Technologies (CTO) intends to conduct an evaluation program to assess the viability of commercial off the shelf (COTS) or Non-Developmental Item (NDI) explosive detection systems (EDS) for inspecting break bulk air cargo.  This announcement is published to solicit data, information, and samples from interested offerors who have sample equipment ready for government evaluation.  TSA Office of Security Technologies (CTO) will evaluate performance of sample equipment through laboratory evaluation, and through operational test and evaluation (OT&E) during a pilot test for those samples that successfully complete the laboratory evaluation.

The TSA's evaluation will be conducted in three phases: 1) Responses to this market survey will be analyzed to determine a list of potential offerors; 2) Potential offerors will provide a sample for laboratory evaluation; and 3) Potential offerors whose samples are deemed acceptable as a result of laboratory evaluation will become selected vendors, receive a Request for Proposals (RFP), and, if selected, their sample(s) will be deployed to airports selected by TSA to participate in operational test and evaluation during a pilot test.  Selected vendors whose samples perform successfully during OT&E will then become qualified vendors.

The TSA will not pay any bid and proposal and/or independent research and development costs incurred in response to this evaluation program, including the market survey, the laboratory evaluation, the draft and final RFP’s, and the operational test and evaluation pilot test.  

All information received in response to this announcement will be considered proprietary.  Respondents shall clearly mark specific company proprietary information accordingly.

MARKET SURVEY REQUIREMENTS

In accordance with the section titled “Submission Requirements for Market Survey”, interested offerors must submit the following in order to be considered for qualification as a potential offeror.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information and Sources Sought synopsis to identify possible potential sources and submission of capability statements to address the increasing need of a 24-hour access to way-finding materials and hospital information for the National Institutes of Health within the Clinical Center. This is not a request for proposals or quotes and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  The North American Industry Classification System (NACIS) Code is 519190. A user-friendly, touch-screen kiosk would provide communication with patients, visitors, employees, and comfortable transition to the near completion of the CRC expansion area of the facility.  In addition to printable maps with paths and directions for the Clinical Center and the National Institutes of Health Campus, the kiosks would provide access to the Clinical Center website, general hospital information, and cafeteria services.  Users would find listings of activities, events, meetings, conferences, and training classes taking place at the Clinical Center and the National Institutes of Health as well as links to Institute, protocol, or physician specific information.  Transportation services (shuttles, taxis, Metro, etc.) and local area information (hotels restaurants, entertainment) would also be available via the kiosk.  Additionally, users would be able to complete the Clinical Center customer survey and access virtual programs as they become available.  Seven kiosks would be placed in heavily trafficked lobby areas in the Clinical Center and the CRC.  Three kiosks would be constructed and operational in the Clinical Center by early 2004.  The remaining four would be installed in the new CRC in coordination with facility completion and activation dates.
The proposed project consists of four phases with distinct product deliverables.  The project vendor would complete a facility survey, in coordination with pertinent completion and activation dates for the CRC.  The planning, design, production, and deployment of the kiosks are done by the vendor.  In addition, the vendor is responsible for deployment and training as well as operational and maintenance support. Submission of capability statements by those offerors based on the functional requirements as follows: 1) Each kiosk is expected to be user-intuitive, multilingual, and ADA compliant.  2) The kiosks must have a print function for way-finding materials and hospital information.  3) The system would be built with web-based software that can integrate with other software, websites and internet services. 4) The software shall be easy to update, and it shall have the capacity for adding additional components over time.  5) Furthermore, the software will be accessible through a variety of end user devices, including web browser stations, wireless tablets and PDA’s kiosks, and personal computers.  The purpose of the survey is to improve the understanding of the Government’s requirement and industry capabilities and allow the Government to obtain quality supplies and services at reasonable prices.  Information provided by any vendor in response to this sources sought shall not be disclosed if doing so would reveal the vendor’s confidential information and will be protected under FAR Part 3.104. Those vendors desiring to submit capability statements should be received no later than January 20, 2004. Any and all proprietary and restricted information provided should be clearly marked.  All capability statements along with any additional information should be directed to Deborah Britton via email at dbritton@cc.nih.gov, fax at (301)594-5920, or phone (301) 594-5914.  Please ensure you have included your return email, address, mailing address, telephone number and facsimile number in the body of your response.

We request prime’s limit the number of their group so that discussion can be meaningful, but at most limit them to ten total.  Request you provide your interest in rank order preference as to the time for the one on one.  If two or more prime’s sign up for the same timeframe, we will conduct a lottery for that time slot.  Preference will be given to the Tuesday slots to those primes that choose not to attend the ASC Group practicum.
