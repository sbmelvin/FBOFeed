<DESC>The goal of the “Combat ID in the Maritime Domain to Reveal Contact Intent” Program is to support the FORCEnet vision by developing measurable advances in Combat Identification (CID) technology that can directly enable and support enhanced Naval capabilities in the Maritime Domain to support Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), Homeland Defense (HLD) missions, Stability Operations, and Major Combat Operations (MCO).  This will be accomplished by developing appropriate technology elements (articulated in sec 6.3 “ProgramThrusts”) and integrating them in a manner that enables proof of principle demonstration of automated Level 2 and Level 3 (Level 2/3) fusion functionality  in one or more Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) scenarios or vignettes. 
 
This Program addresses current warfighter functionality shortfalls in information integration and higher levels of fusion and inference resulting from limitations in technology and reductions in staffing.  The Program will develop advanced and novel approaches for automated integration and interpretation of information from multiple (multi-INT) sensors, sources of various types including contextual descriptions.  Currently, Level 1 fusion products, principally “tracks”, represent the limit of what can be automatically known about objects and events throughout the battlespace.  Humans must derive all higher levels of relationship and inference as well as bringing in the context describing the battlespace environment.  This program will develop automated techniques to determine relationships among objects and events, in the context of relevant specific influences such as weather, terrain, topography, traffic flow, adversary doctrine, etc., as well as general influences including political, economic, and cultural factors.  The program will also develop automated techniques to interpret those relationships to understand behaviors that may have military significance, and to assess military and maritime security impact and adversary intent.  Technology articles resulting from this research will be software that is integrated into emerging net-centric Navy and Marine Corps Command & Control and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2 and ISR) acquisition programs through a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)  such as Composable FORCEnet (CFn) 2.0A or DCGS Infrastructure Backbone (DIB) in accordance with Net-centric Enterprise Services (NCES) and Net-centric Enterprise Solutions for Interoperability (NESI) guidance.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Micro Isotope Power Sources (MIPS).  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice 

DARPA is soliciting proposals for the development of Micro Isotope Power Sources (MIPS) that are able to (1) provide 35 mW or more of continuous power, (2) be less than or equal to 1 cubic centimeter (cc) in volume, and (3) meet applicable safety requirements with substantial margin. A projected leakage rate of 500 mrem/year measured at 30 cm is the maximum considered tolerable, with leakage rates of 50 mrem/year or lower considered highly desirable. Additional safety requirements may apply, depending on the technology offered.

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 06-25 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site—http://teaming.sysplan.com/BAA-06-25/ --- has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is John D. Evans, Ph.D., M.B.A., fax:  (703) 248-1808, electronic mail: jevans@darpa.mil.

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled “BAA 06-25, Micro Isotope Power Sources (MIPS), Proposer Information Pamphlet” which provides further information on Micro Isotope Power Sources (MIPS), the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, the Grants.gov website: http://www.grants.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  Proposers must submit an original and (4) copies of the proposal and two (2) electronic copies (i.e., two (2) separate disks) of the full proposal [in PDF (preferred), or MS-Word readable, each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a CD-ROM].  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 06-25, offeror organization, proposal title (short title recommended), and Copy __ of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 06-25) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Tuesday, May 2, 2006, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps and FedGrants.  Proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 06-25 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT SYNOPSIS The U.S. House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Energy and Water Development have directed the U.S. Department of Energy¡¦s Office of Environmental Management to undertake a management review with the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA).  Accordingly, the Office of Environmental Management (EM) intends to solicit a proposal and negotiate a sole source contract with NAPA pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 to perform an independent program management review of EM¡¦s reorganization. The Assistant Secretary of Energy for Environmental Management intends to have NAPA evaluate and focus on three specific areas: Organization and Management; Human Capital; and, Acquisition Policies and Procedures.  The review will include an examination of prior EM organizations to determine their relationship to the new organization structure and the effect on management and business operations.  Additionally, Human Resources (HR) will be one of the highest priorities and will include an evaluation of the HR operations of EM to include the competencies needed and required staffing levels.  Furthermore, it is intended to have NAPA evaluate the new organization and provide advice during the course of the reorganization, which is scheduled to begin April 1, 2006, and to suggest mid-course corrections, as necessary. The proposed Statement of Work provides that NAPA will accomplish the following primary tasks: Develop a perspective on the theory and practicality of the re-organization. Review the new organization structure and how it will affect the management and business operations of EM.  The review will include an examination of prior EM organizations to determine their relationship to the new structure.  During the course of the study, NAPA will provide feedback and advice to EM to assist it in the implementation of its reorganization. Review EM¡¦s human capital processes and provide advice on how they can be more effective and efficient in the implementation of EM¡¦s programs.  NAPA will examine the roles and responsibilities of line and staff at both Headquarters and field sites to identify options for improvement and to ensure alignment with the EM mission.  Furthermore, NAPA will analyze current and future competencies for core functions and technical areas required for cleanup activities; conduct human capital assessments to identify workforce planning issues, leadership and management development processes, and any observed deficiencies or skill gaps that may exist; career retention; and, succession planning activities. These activities will be coordinated with the findings of the acquisition and organization studies with the goal of developing recommended strategies to align workforce competencies needed to meet the mission requirements. Review EM¡¦s existing acquisition policies and processes and provide advice on the oversight policies and procedures as well as how the acquisition processes will be conducted under the new organization structure.  In particular, NAPA will review how well project management procedures are being followed in carrying out the acquisition function. Included in these are procedures for developing acquisition strategies up front and effectively using risk management procedures to anticipate and address problems.  In particular, NAPA will assess the effectiveness of performance-based approaches and the use of incentives to promote successful business outcomes.  The number and roles of contracting officials and contracting officer technical representatives will also be addressed. NAPA is an independent, non-profit organization for public governance established in 1967 and chartered by Congress.  NAPA is uniquely qualified to carry out this review due to its unique experience and expertise in analyzing and evaluating governmental structures and processes. The Congressional charter established the following objectives and purpose for NAPA: „X Evaluating structure, administration, operations, and program performance of federal and other governmental agencies, anticipating, identifying, and analyzing significant problems and suggesting timely corrective actions. „X Foreseeing and examining critical emerging issues in governance and formulating practical approaches to their solution. „X Demonstrating by the conduct of its affair a commitment to the highest professional standards of ethics and scholarship. These objectives and purposes reflect the intent of Congress that independent and expert advice on a broad range of policy and management issues would improve the quality of government.  As a result, the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Energy and Water Development directed the Secretary of Energy to undertake a management review for the Environmental Program with NAPA, within available funds by its letter dated September 23, 2005.

No other source is known to have the requisite experience and technical skills to provide support needed by EM.

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation to acquire leadership and organization development consulting and services for employees of NGA.  All contractor personnel shall have a Top Secret Clearance/Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) access.  The anticipated contract will be firm-fixed price and will include a base year plus four (4) one-year option periods. The period of performance will be from date of contract award (estimated to be March 2006) through March 2011, including options.   This acquisition will be solicitated and awarded utilizing FAR subpart 12, Commercial Acquisitions, procedures.  Leadership and organization development consulting and services provide assistance to NGA leaders throughout the organization by helping them address a multiplicity of challenges including: downsizing; outsourcing; facility closures; office realignments; new business processes; and production integration.  These challenges come at a time when NGA is focused on coping with a smaller workforce; recruiting and retaining top talent; keeping abreast of leading edge technology; and working with a workforce diverse in culture and learning styles.  Current Agency leadership and organization development consulting and services include:  Change Management, Organizational Restructuring, Leadership Development, Strategic Planning, Creative Problem Solving, Interpersonal Communication, Team Building, Workforce Diversity and Group Facilitation.  This requirement is a 100 % small business set-aside. The applicable North American Industry Classification code is 611430, size standard is $6,000,000.  Proposals received from other than small business concerns will not be accepted.  The Government intends to award without discussion but reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary in making the award decision. Offerors are highly encouraged to submit their best proposals, ensuring full compliance with solicitation requirements (e.g., required fill-ins, Reps & Certs, instructions to offerors, etc).  Award will be made to the technically acceptable offeror determined the most advantageous to the government considering past performance, price and price-related factors.  Techniques utilizing past performance information and price will be evaluated; therefore, award may be made to other than the lowest priced offeror. Solicitation HM1576-06-R-0006 is scheduled for release on or about 25 January 2006, with a closing date of 24 February 2006. No telephone, fax, email or mailed requests for the RFP will be honored. The solicitation (and any amendments) will be available for downloading on the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS), website at https://www.fedteds.gov for all interested parties. It is the responsibility of each offeror to review web pages at Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), (http://www.fbo.gov) and FedTeDS (https://www.fedteds.gov) for notice of amendments, updates or changes to current information.  Any prospective offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.   Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) now requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, whether before or after RFP closing, with no obligations. Proposal preparation cost will be borne by offerors submitting proposals in response to the solicitation. Solicitation will include Statement of Work (SOW).

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIH, intends to negotiate a sole-source contract with Tulane University, Center for Bioenvironmental Research , 1430 Tulane Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana to conduct a clinical epidemiology study of patients with chronic airway disease in the Gulf Coast region near New Orleans.  The uniqueness of the gulf coast after Hurricane Katrina, in particular the high risk of exposure to mold and microbial toxins among the clean-up and construction workers and residents, presents an unprecedented opportunity to uncover the role of gene sequence variants and environmental exposures in the exacerbation of airway and other forms of  lung disease.  The degree to which mold concentrations, mold species, and mold toxins affect a person’s health is not clearly understood.  Adequately addressing these questions will require prospective data be collected over approximately 30 months to define disease status in patients with chronic airway disease, and to define measures of exposure to mold and microbial toxins in biological samples of blood, urine and expired air, and from environmental samples collected in the human breathing zone and in indoor air in the household and workplace.  Blood samples shall also be collected to identify specific genetic variants for disease exacerbation and progression in future studies.  Some of the biological and environmental samples shall be analyzed by the contractor; the remainder of the samples will be stored at Tulane’s own laboratory or shipped to a designated laboratory of analysis.  Specifically Tulane University shall conduct activities in the following areas: (1) Recruit and enroll approximately 1000 patients with chronic airway disease into the study. Provide and modify strategies for recruiting a diverse study group, including women, persons from lower socioeconomic backgrounds of particular ethnic or racial groups, older and hard-to-reach groups for study participation;(2) Conduct baseline and follow-up clinical assessments; analyze test results to determine airway disease status (exacerbating or stable). ; (3) Collect biological specimens of blood, urine, and expired air during clinical assessment; (4) Conduct environmental sampling of personal or indoor air in the study participants’ residence and/or workplace; (5) Administer a questionnaire to obtain information on reactive airway disease status and about potential confounding variables and effect modifiers; (6) Maintain a high response rate of 90% during the period following the baseline clinical assessment.  Maintain a secured (patient protected) electronic database of study information for rapid retrieval and analysis; (7)Maintain a high level of community involvement and outreach;(8) Ensure data abstracting, editing, recording, tracking, and security.  All protocols shall be the responsibility of the Contractor with approval from the Government before implementing. The period of performance will be for 30 months with a planned award date on or before September 29, 2006.  It is anticipated that this project will require approximately 13,936 direct labor hours over 30 months.  Sole Source Authority: 41 USC 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1--Only One Responsible Source.  Tulane University’s Center for Bioenvironmental Research have extensive capabilities in conducting complex respiratory epidemiology and clinical studies.  Tulane investigators have extensive experience conducting both occupational and community-based health studies in this region, and have first-hand knowledge of the medical management infrastructure and level of operation of individual hospitals and clinics in the region.  Tulane has a world-renowned expert, and recent appointee to the National Academy of Sciences, in the area of mold and microbial toxins, Dr. Joan Bennett.  There are only a handful of such experts in the world, and having Dr. Bennett at Tulane is an advantage. Any other interested sources desiring consideration for this requirement must fully identify their interests and capabilities to the Contracting Officer listed above no later than 4:00 p.m. on April 28, 2006.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; no solicitation is available.  See Numbered Note 22 and 26*****

<CONTACT>MATTHEW J. GROWNEY, Contract Specialist, Phone: (513) 487-2029, E-Mail: growney.matthew@epa.gov
<DESC>Under the authority of  FAR 13.106-1(b), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Clemson University to provide field sampling and logistical support to EPA?s research activities at the Sanagamo-Weston/TwelveMile Creek/Lake Hartwell PCB contaminated Superfund Site in Pickens County, South Carolina. Clemson shall work in collaboration with a multi-disciplinary EPA research team which aims provide tools to more rapidly determine the effectiveness of remedial operations, further characterize the site, and identify mechanisms of contaminant transfer to evaluate the progress of the monitored natural recovery of the site.  EPA?s research will be focused on levels of exposure in indigenous fauna and sediment and movement of PCBs through these aquatic ecosystems and will be performed mostly in a field setting.  Clemson University has been determined to be the only known source able to perform this requirement due to the following exclusive capabilities they offer: 1) Clemson has the only known aquatic facility that is receiving a clean and constant water supply from Lake Hartwell to allow acclimation to conditions and is situated to be capable of providing rapid deployment by boat to sites on the Twelvemile Creek arm of Lake Hartwell.  Clemson also is the only known source that can provide accessible storage and staging areas for EPA equipment, instrumentation, and supplies to support the research effort.  Clemson has an aquatic facility that can maintain up to 300 fathead minnows and up to 1500 Corbicula clams for up to 30 days prior to deployment. 2) Clemson is the only known source that is intimately familiar with the research sites where the sampling transects are located.  Their level of familiarity and expertise with the sites provides them with the ability to quickly reach and bring equipment into these remote areas.  Clemson?s knowledge of and accessibility to the research areas will enable them to perform the sampling for this phase of research by the start date of Spring 2006. 3) Clemson is the only known source that has familiarity with the patterns, movements, migration, and emergence of the fish, bivalves, and aquatic insects of the Lake Hartwell ecosystem. 4) Clemson?s proximity to the contaminated Twelvemile Creek arm of Lake Hartwell provides  them the unique capability to monitor, detect, and respond to emergent aquatic insects which shall be collected during the spring-summer prolific hatches and to perform night-time blacklight sampling during the peak hatching season. 5) Clemson has experience and expertise in analyzing PCB concentrations in fish tissue, invertebrates, and plankton to characterize the presence or absence of PCBs in all components of the Lake Hartwell ecosystem.  Clemson has experience and expertise in dealing with the difficult analysis and complex matrices involved in the research being conducted in the Lake Hartwell ecosystem.  This will allow Clemson to reliably and immediately contribute to the research goal of integrating data from all PCB sources in the Lake Hartwell ecosystem in an attempt to develop a PCB mass balance for the system. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12, Commercial Acquisition Procedures. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond.  Documentation must be received by March 29, 2006 in order to be considered by the EPA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties should submit a written response to Matthew J. Growney by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail growney.matthew@epa.gov . Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>Thinning:   
This project requires stand density management through the process of cutting down trees by hand to meet the spacing requirements in the Stices Interface, Sumpter Interface, and McCully sale areas, on approximately 650 acres.  These units are being treated in preparation for grapple piling (which is not included in this contract) and hand piling (some of which are included in this contract).  Use of motorized equipment other than hand-held equipment such as power saws and brush cutters will not be permitted off roads in the project area without approval of the Contracting Officer.  Slash shall be treated so that any remaining slash meets the requirements as described in the specific tasks section and Detailed Unit Information Sheet(s). 

Hand Piling:  
To reduce the threat of catastrophic wild fire, this project will reduce fuel loading within selected pre-commercially thinned areas in the Stices Interface, Sumpter Interface, & McCully sale areas. Fuel shall be hand piled to reduce fuel loadings on approximately 562 acres.  A 4-foot by 4-foot piece of paper shall cover a portion of the pile to facilitate burning.  Government shall provide all paper required for piles.    

Material to be treated is composed of timber litter, selected standing dead trees 9 inches dbh or less, and pre-commercial thinning debris from this thinning project. This material is identified as fuel model 12 as defined by the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report, PNW-52 1976.

Fuel amounts vary but are estimated at 0 to 3 feet in depth for a total of 5-30 tons/acre.  It may be necessary to transport slash up to a 50 feet radius of pile(s) to meet minimum pile size requirements.

<DESC>RFP-NAS-0171-2006.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) intends to make multiple awards for the provision of single-faith, residential re-entry programs at one or more pilot site institutions.  The pilot sites will be announced through the issuance of the solicitation for these services.   Prospective offerors shall be permitted to submit proposals for any number, or all of the pilot site locations.  The BOP reserves the right to place an award for services at one or up to six of its designated institutions based upon evaluation of proposals, but each site will accommodate only one program.

The purpose of the residential re-entry program shall be to facilitate personal transformation for the participating inmates, and thereby reduce recidivism through promoting the virtues of productive work, respect for others, self-worth, responsibility, and accountability.  The program shall encourage re-connection with family and community, and the development of healthy and productive habits of living.  The program shall match inmates with personal mentors and a faith-community, community organization, or support group at their release destination to promote successful reintegration (i.e., employment, housing, avoidance of recidivism, etc.).  

There are ten program goal areas, which are as follows: 1) Daily living; 2) Mental Health; 3) Wellness; 4) Interpersonal skills; 5) Academic; 6) Cognitive; 7) Vocational; 8) Leisure time; 9) Character; and 10) Spiritual development.  These program goal areas are intended to foster successful rehabilitation and reintegration into the community in order to reduce the likelihood of recidivism.  The contractor shall develop a curriculum that demonstrates consistency with program goals and outlines how the contractor plans to incorporate program components that foster growth in the ten program goal areas.  The contractor shall provide sufficient staffing to cover a rigorous schedule, including both daytime and evening programming during the week and on weekends for up to 150 inmates per institution.

The contractor shall make available, on a non-discriminatory basis, a single-faith, residential re-entry program consistent with the requirements of the solicitation.  The manner and method in performing the tasks outlined in the Statement of Work are the sole responsibility and within the sole discretion of the contractor, provided that the contractor performs in accordance with the Statement of Work.

The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 624190, and the requirement is issued on an unrestricted basis.  A pre-proposal conference is anticipated and shall be announced in the cover letter to the solicitation.  A Firm-Fixed-Price Indefinite Delivery type contract with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods is anticipated for each site.

The solicitation will be made available on or about March 27, 2006, and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration’s Federal Business Opportunities website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Hard copies of the solicitation document will not be available.  The website provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments and pre-proposal conference information, will also be distributed solely through this website.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this website to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.   The anticipated date for receipt of proposals is May 1, 2006, and the anticipated date of award is July 31, 2006.  Faith-based and community-based organizations are encouraged and have the right to submit offers/bids equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Shelly Robacker, (309) 782-5237
<DESC>The HQ, U.S. Army Field Support Command has issued a Draft Request for Proposal W52P1J-06-R-0049 under LOGCAP IV to solicit industry comments and it can be found at http://www.afsc.army.mil/ac/aais/ioc/.  A pre-solicitation conference is planned for 29 March 2005. A Limit of 2 offerors from each company may attend. Contractors may request appointments for one on one time spent with government officials. These shall be limited to 20 minutes.   The proposed strategy for this acquisition reflects a significant change from current and past LOGCAP contracts.  Under this proposed LOGCAP IV acquisition strategy, instead of awarding all LOGCAP planning, support, and program execution worldwide to a sin gle contractor, we intend to award contracts for LOGCAP program execution to multiple contractors, with a separate single contract for LOGCAP worldwide and regional planning and program support. Solicitation W52P1J-06-R-0049 shall be for the execution port ion of the LOGCAP IV program. Solicitation W52P1J-06-R-0072 shall be for the planning and support portion of the LOGCAP IV program.    The principal objective of LOGCAP IV Contract is to provide combat support and combat service support (CS/CSS) augmentation to Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) and Army Service Component Commanders (ASCCs) throughout the full range of military operations.   L OGCAP services are also available to support military services, coalition and/or multi-national forces, and other governmental/non-governmental agencies. Each execution contractor would be required to execute logistics support in all types of environments on multiple task orders, simultaneously, in support of several dozen to tens of thousands of troops per task order in the general areas of Supply, Field Services, and Other Operations/Services.  A second objective, outside the scope of this acquisition, is to provide worldwide and regional planning. This shall be posted via solicitation W52P1J-06-R0072.   We will accomplish these objectives by awarding multiple LOGCAP IV program execution contract s, and a separate LOGCAP planning/support contract.  To preclude any perception of improper competitive advantage, the execution contractors and planning/support contractor can not have any business relationship (teaming, partnering, subcontracting) or fin ancial interests in each other. Each Execution Contractor must work closely with the planning/support contractor to facilitate accurate planning and expedited EVENT execution.  The support contractor will be required to sign non-disclosure agreements with the LOGCAP IV contractors for access to their proprietary information in order to facilitate the planning process. Since the LOGCAP IV Contractors will be working with classifie d operational plans, they must meet National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) requirements to access such information. The Program Execution Contractors will be required to obtain SECRET clearances for any personnel managing classified  information. This procurement will be a full and open competition, and utilize a BEST VALUE evaluation selection process that includes evaluation criteria focusing on technical, management, past performance, cost, and a sample scenario. It is anticipated that the RFP w ill result in multiple awards, with a ten (10) year IDIQ contract, with one base year and nine (9) option years.  The contract includes a Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) structure that supports Firm Fixed Price, Cost Plus Award Fee, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (C PFF) and Time and Material (T&M) contract elements. Task Orders will be competed between contractors receiving a base contract award, unless an exception to competition under FAR 16.505.(b) (2) exists.  The minimum funding for each of the Global LOGCAP IV contracts is for a core program office. Each offeror shall provide a staff, which will be responsible for keeping company internal plans and deployment lists current, and interacting with a separat e planning/support contractor who will be updating the worldwide management and staffing plan and regional plans. The maximum permitted on each LOGCAP IV contract is $5 billion per year. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. This synopsis  does not constitute a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any associated costs incurred as a result of this notice.  The point of contact at HQ, U S Army Field Support Command for th is Synopsis is Ms. Shelly Robacker, (shelly.robacker@us.army.mil).

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to issue a Firm-Fixed Price contract to ITT for 330 ALQ-214 (V)2 Radio Frequency (RF) Jammer systems.  This effort will consist of a base year [Full Rate Production (FRP) 3 (FY06)] and five option years [FRO 4 through 8 (FY07-FY11)] exercisable at the Government's unilateral disretion.  The ALQ-214(V)2 Radio Frequency (RF) Jammer was developed as a major subsystem within the Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures (IDECM) Radio Frequency Countermeasures (RFCM) Program.  The AN/ALQ-214(V)2 is a self-protection RF Jammer for use in tactical combat Navy aircraft against RF guided surface-to-air and air-to-air threats.  The AN/ALQ-214(V2) subsystems are required for installation into the Navy’s F/A-18E/F.   
The breakout of units per production lot/year is as follows: base year (FRP 3) = approximately 55 systems; first option year (FRP 4) = approximately 51 systems; second option year (FRP 5) = approximately 61 systems; third option year (FRP 6) = approximately 57 systems; fourth option year (FRP 7) = approximately 53 systems; and fifth option year (FRP 8) = approximately 53 systems.
	ITT is the designer, developer, and manufacturer of the ALQ-214 and is the only source with the personnel, facilities and knowledge to fulfill this requirement.  ITT is located at 100 Kingsland Road, Clifton, NJ 07014-1993.  The Government point of contact for this action is Michael J. Coon via Email at michael.coon@navy.mil.

Contractor shall submit their soffit finish plans with sketches and/or drawings for approval by the Construction Representative.
 
B.	  The building will remain in full operation during the construction period, therefore it may be beneficial to both the contractor and the government to perform much of the work during “off-hours”.



Phase I – This phase of the work is intended to include any and all work necessary at the garage entrance.  This shall include removing existing Albany door, side rails, and associated components.

The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/MSFC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=62  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). 1. What are the electrical resisitivity characteristics of all materials to be tested if possible?  If not, can you provide the maximum and minimum electrical resistivity values for the family? (These were provided in the writeup) 2. Does NASA have an induction heating power supply already that they hope to use for testing?  If so, what are the specifications for this machine? (on order – max power is 500 kw) 3. Is the frequency range 30 – 100 kHz fixed?  If so, this may be too low for acceptable induction coil efficiency considering desired power in the part is up to 125 kW. (these values are fixed) 4. What is the procedure for cleaning/impurity removal in the chamber prior to pressurizing? (The chamber will be purged with nitrogen) 5. Do you have voltage breakdown information on N-He atmosphere in the desired composition and pressures for tests? (The tests will be with nitrogen and hydrogen at high pressure – generally greater than 500 psi.  There should be no problem with breakdown) 6. Could you provide information on the heat loss characteristics of the tube under these conditions? (The tube will contain flowing hydrogen with the intent to flow at a rate which will maintain the tube temperature at 2500-3100 K) 7.In Figure 3, the position of the site holes is specified.  Is there any flexibility to move them slightly?  If so, how much?  If not, this may cause additional complexity in the coil manufacturing. (No)

<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to support the Ethiopian Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Agency (DPPA) through its Emergency Preparedness Strengthening Program (EPSP). The overall goal of EPSP is to improve the DPPA’s capacity to manage through shocks. Specifically, one of the systemic changes it hopes to bring about is to enable DPPA and its partners to better understand livelihoods and coping strategies of populations vulnerable to food insecurity, and so be better equipped to anticipate shocks that risk lives and livelihoods through improved early warning.  The Ethiopian Early Warning System (EWS) has several components including:

a)	regular monitoring which mainly focuses on information gathering that mainly includes indicators such as climatic data, crop production, markets and prices, livestock production, other sources of income such as wage labor, petty trade, petty commodity production, remittances, wild fruit collection etc, human health, malnutrition, coping mechanisms, food stress or famine indicators;
b)	disaster area assessments, mainly focusing on rapid-onset disasters;
c)	rapid health and nutrition assessments;
d)	intermittent nutritional surveillance; and 
e)	annual multi-agency emergency need assessments.

The successful proposers will be required to validate designs against the RFP requirements and accept design responsibility (i.e. sign and seal design drawings and specifications by registered professional engineers and architects).  

Contractors who are selected to receive a MACC award will be given the opportunity to compete for future individual task orders.  The estimate range of task orders awarded under this contract is between $250,000 and $15,000,000.

In Phase I a maximum of seven (7) firms will be pre-qualified to participate in Phase II procurement.  The solicitation will be formatted as an RFP in accordance with the requirements designated by sections of FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the Two-Phase Design-Build section procedures of FAR 36.3.  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors’ proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.  The evaluation factors for Phase I are as follows:  Past Performance and Relevant Project Experience, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach, and Small Business Sub-Contracting Effort.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences intends to negotiate with the National Institute of Public Health in Norway to collect, process, store, and manage specimens, and to develop tools to enhance use of the specimen samples and collaboration in conjunction with the Norway Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa).  In the MoBa study, approximately 100,000 pregnant women will be enrolled during the 17th week of pregnancy; these women and their offspring will be followed until the offspring are adults.  Blood and urine are collected from the women, who also complete a series of questionnaires about themselves and their offspring.  

The goals of the study are manifold, but the study primarily will serve as a flexible platform from which a wide variety of studies can be done using the samples and associated data.  Increasing the number of subjects with environmental specimens will: (1) increase the statistical power in studies of more frequent outcomes to detect gene-environment interactions; (2) give adequate statistical power to study environmental determinants of rare diseases such as autism, cerebral palsy, hypospadias, and schizophrenia; and (3) increase the ability to conduct a large number of studies, especially for more frequent outcomes.
 
The MoBa study was initiated by and run by the National Institute of Health in Norway.  Specimen collection began in 1999.  In 2002, NIEHS scientists began having additional specimen material collected from the pregnant women to enhance the ability to evaluate associations between environmental exposures during pregnancy and subsequent health outcomes in the offspring.  NIEHS is currently supporting further specimen collection in conjunction with the MoBa study.  No other source has access to the MoBa cohort or the related specimens and data, and no other source has a large enough study in which both blood and urine specimens were collected to effectively meet NIEHS’ needs.  The National Institute of Health in Norway is the only source capable of performing NIEHS’ requirement. 

Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1) and HHSAR 306.302-1.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The sources sought notice is amended to post the following questions and resulting answers: 1) Is any additional information available on the generator to be used as the source for this inverter? This inverter will be part of a reconstruction project.  New subsystems are being researched in all areas of the generator.  2) Is there only one three phase winding available at the input of the PE or are there multiple isolated windings as is the case in the 3KW TQG? The alternator used in the current 3kW does have three isolated windings, we are researching different types of alternators however it is most likely that three isolated windings will be the source input. 3)Is any low voltage control power available? There is a 24VDC battery on-board the system used for motor starting. 4)Are any fault reporting outputs desired? Fault reporting would be desirable at the immediate maintenance level (fault can be fixed/cleared on the spot), but not required. 5)Is it desirable to have the PE output to be able to be configured as a single 120V 2 wire output at 3KW? Yes, we are looking for a single phase 120V, 60Hz 3kW output from the PE.

FLIGHT TERMINATION CONTROL PANEL, COMMUNICATIONS AND ROUTING

STATEMENT OF WORK


1.0	INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this Statement of Work is to define the requirements for the services to create a control and communications system linking one or more FTS officers with the FTS transmission and verification equipment used to transmit to launch vehicles.  The system requires two major components, a control panel which collects button and switch state data and sends it to the routing computer, and a routing computer which acknowledges receipt of state information and presents it in proper form to the encoder/exciter and amplifier.  The routing computer also echoes the command state and the verification state data back to the control panel.  Communication between the two is through voice grade analog DSO channels using modem circuitry.  

2.0  REQUIREMENTS
The contractor shall perform all tasks required in the Statement of work to produce a FTS Control Panel with Power Key Switch and Carrier Key Switch and a Routing Computer including 16 modems and Ethernet switch with 7 CAT5 Ports and 1 Fiber Port.  In addition to meeting the technical requirements, the contractor is required to prepare and produce associated documentation, i.e., design reviews, TIM’s, electrical, mechanical design, and full documentation of electrical/software I/F.

2.1	TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
The contractor shall provide a control panel that contains DPDT switches and two LEDs.  The programming will be firmware written in assembly language with no operating system or file system.  It is to be stored on chip in Flash EEPROM memory and executed directly out of that memory.  The FTS equipment end will consist of four redundant routing computers connected to four FTS equipment chains.  For interfacing to legacy equipment, discrete input and output signals will be handled by solid-state relays.  Outputs will be isolated contact closures or powered (non-isolated) with a voltage source.  Inputs are to isolated voltage or current loads.  For interfacing to FTS encoder/exciter, amplifier and verification receivers, each chain is connected to its own 10/100 ethernet switch.  Each routing computer will connect with two switches and pairs of switches are linked with fiber optic cabling so each router has access to all four equipment chains.  Each routing computer will contain 16 modems to allow it to communicate with up to 16 FTS control panels.

2.2	MEETINGS, REVIEW, CONFERENCES
A system design review shall be held at a mutually agreed upon time and place to review the electrical and mechanical design along with software development.

2.3  DOCUMENTATION
The contractor shall provide full documentation of the control panel mechanical, electrical design as well as software development and support integration documentation.  


The performance of tasks must conform to Department of Labor Standards and Wages in place at this time.  Conformance with both domestic and foreign standards will provide the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) and NASA with the capability to meet both domestic and foreign customer requirements.  

Please note that this synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for competitive bids/proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide services / products listed above.  

Firms responding to this synopsis must identify their company’s capabilities to perform the requirements described herein, reference the synopsis number and indicate whether or not that they are a small or small disadvantaged business concern as defined in FAR 52.219-1.  The NAICS code is 334515.  

The information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Air Force not to open the requirement to open competition, based on response to this sources sought synopsis, is solely within the discretion of the Air Force.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this sources sought synopsis.  It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded in April 2006. 

All responses may be sent via e-mail to Terence.vickers@edwards.af.mil or mailed to 412 TW/PKDB, 5 South Wolfe Ave, Edwards AFB, CA 93524-1185, Attention: Terence D.

If the Government decides to contract for this effort at a later date with the issuance of an RFP to industry, the value of the resulting contract is estimated to be approximately $260 million for a period of 5 years. <br> <br> The Directorate of Contracting is soliciting interest and capability statements for a potential competitive acquisition from qualified contractors.  The purpose of publicizing notices for potential actions is to increase competition, to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and to assist small businesses in general in obtaining contracts and subcontracts.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), but instead is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to issuing the RFP.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 541511 applies. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size for code 541511, particularly if they are a small business.  If business size is transitioning to other than "small business" in the next 90 days, please indicate as such. <br><br> Please note this sources sought notice is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  It is not the intention of the Government to enter into a contract based on this notice or to otherwise pay for information solicited. <br><br> Part 2:  Description of Requirements<br> <br> The scope of work contemplated under this effort could include the following activities and systems but is not limited to the: <br> <br> 1)	Legacy Military<br> MilPDS (Military Personnel Data System), MANPER-B, PRISM, WAPS and PC-III comprise the group referred to as Military Legacy Personnel Systems. MilPDS supports Total Force, to include AF Active Duty, Air National Guard, AF Reserve, and personnel that are discharged, deceased or retired. The system supports the full career life-cycle of the military components, supporting recruitment and accession of military personnel, education and training, career maintenance, separation and retirement, promotion and military utilization.  The Promotion Recommendation and In-Board Support Management Information System (PRISM) provides automated support for all phases of officer (active duty, Reserve and Guard) central nomination, designation and selection board processing. The Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS) provides automated support for enlisted promotions including senior noncommissioned officer evaluation boards.  The Personnel Concept III (PC-III) system is a distributed computer network designed to support commanders and their staffs. It provides administrative and personnel support to Commander Support Staffs and work centers in operational and support units. This effort will also include sustainment of web-based applications that allows Air Force members self-service capability through unique HR functionality. <br> <br> 2)	Legacy Civilian<br> These applications help to facilitate the notification process and arrangement for change of appointment (i.e. CAO), facilitate job search, vacancy announcement, employment application process ((i.e. Civilian Announcement Notification System (CANS), Resume Writer, Self Nomination)), provide a comprehensive decision support tool in selected civilian personnel business processes (i.e. Civilian Personnel Decision Support System  (CPDSS), feature civilian career information online (i.e. Civilian Virtual Career Brief, CVCB), support all aspects of new employee in-processing (i.e. Civilian Virtual In-Processing , CVIP), provide capabilities for AF employees to conduct civilian benefits and entitlements business (i.e. Employee Benefit Information System, EBIS), maintain personnel emergency data (i.e. Emergency Data System, EMDS), provide capabilities to conduct selected civilian personnel services utilization of the telephone system (i.e. Interactive Voice Response System, IVRS), and provide electronic Official Personnel Files and an information management tool in support of the centralization of the AF Civilian Personnel Operations Directorate (i.e. Personnel Automated Records Information System, PARIS). <br> <br> 3)	virtual Personnel Service Center (vPSC) <br> The contractor shall provide support and future upgrades to vPSC which will be an integral component of Personnel Service Delivery, an initiative to transform business HR practices from predominately face-to-face contact to on-line tools and resources as well as expand existing contact centers. vPSC is under development today and will provide one-stop-shopping to airmen in a seamless, integrated fashion through web-enabled self-service functionality.  vPSC will enable the migration of legacy systems applications that will not be subsumed by DIMHRS.  vPSC will create the modernized information technology infrastructure necessary to enable cross-functional sharing of data.  The most prominent of the Air Force unique Human Resources capabilities lie in the areas of training, promotions and assignments which includes the Chief of Staff's (CSAF) directed and evolving Force Development Program (new force management initiative/methodology) and a one-stop information and transactional capability integrating with DIMHRS, Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS) and Air Force unique systems.  The Personnel Service Delivery initiative is aimed at modernizing the way the Air Force does business with Total Force personnel and pay via centralization of processes and IT support.  These continuing and merging capabilities are essential to the Air Force for its continuing personnel and pay mission of acquiring, training, developing, building, paying and employing people for their assigned jobs within the DoD. <br> <br> 4)	Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS) Transition from the current systems of record, MilPDS to the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS).  The focus of this effort will include continued migration of data and functionality to DIMHRS or a modernized, sustainable platform, control of interfaces to ensure successful data exchange, as well as continued infrastructure support and upgrade to include the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) being built as a part of vPSC. <br> <br> 5)	Contact Center<br> The Contact Center will provide Human Resource (HR) Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) and Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC) Representatives to the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC).  Each CSR/ADSC representative will need an in-depth understanding of the Air Force personnel structure, programs, policies, procedures, and data systems in order to support.  The overall mission is to leverage technology to execute and integrate personnel operations to support commanders, their people and personnel field activities.  Hardware infrastructure consists of a Microsoft Windows XP operating system.  Primary software applications consist of, but are not limited to:  REMEDY and RightNow Web e-service Center; MilPDS (Oracle Version 7.3 or higher); ADSC's Retrieval Application Website (RAW) System; RightNow Web case management/knowledge management systems; Virtual military Personnel Flight (vMPF); Defense Joint Accounting Military System (DJMS); Personnel Concept III (PCIII); Form Flow/Jet Form/Information Management Tools; Air Force Officer Qualifying Test System (AFOQTS); Defense Clearance Investigations Index (DCII) and AFPC Intranet and Internet. <br> <br> 6)	IT Service<br> Requirements for IT service include:  small computer customer support in all areas of hardware, software, application, and personal digital assistants.  Tracking personnel data systems communication-computer acquisitions, services, obligations and liquidations.  Operation LAN Support is required for research, analysis, design, development, documentation, and maintenance of personnel software databases and systems.

The contracts anticipated period of performance is estimated 6 months.  

The T4 Tactical Tape Load is a subset of the J10 Tactical Load.  General Dynamics recently developed the J10 Tactical Load and is the developer of the previous T3 Tactical Tape upgrade.  General Dynamics has the required expertise and knowledge of the legacy systems Tactical Tape Loads to provide the integration of the T4 subset into the FMS device.

With General Dynamics having extensive legacy Tactical Tape experience on the FMS Tactics Trainer coupled with completion of the J10 Upgrade, and access to the 15F8 development systems, General Dynamics is considered the only logical source that can meet the FMS schedule and technical requirements.

General Dynamics is the only contractor that currently has the design and technical knowledge and access to accomplish the T4 Tactical Tape Upload, inclusive of legacy issues, for domestic testing and install/integration into the FMS device.  Procurement of another design/development would not be cost effective for the government.  

This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This synopsis is issued to provide notice of our intent to award this effort on a sole source basis to General Dynamics; therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.  Questions concerning this requirement should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Ayana Graham, via email to ayana.graham@navy.mil or by telephone at 407-380-4012.

<SUBJECT>16 -- Wideband Threat Emitter Kit (WBK)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-FA8217-06-R-AAAB
<RESPDATE>040306
<ARCHDATE>07312006
<CONTACT>James Thiros, Contracting Officer, Phone 801-586-1229, Fax 801-586-3366, Email james.thiros@hill.af.mil
<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis for a Wideband Threat Emitter Kit (WBK).  The following information and subsequent request for information is provided to assist the Air Force conduct Market Research of Industry to identify sources that meet Air Force requirements for the Wideband Threat Emitter Kit program.  The Hill AFB, Utah, 84 SCSG/GBSTP Range Threat System Program Office (SPO) intends to generate a purchase request ultimately leading to contract award for the production (including integral testing, integration, validation, and support) of two (2) Wideband Threat Emitter Kits through a single award Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.  The WTK program will be a non-developmental effort with a 24-26 month delivery schedule.  

The U.S. Air Force, U. S. Air National Guard (ANG), and U.S. Navy have a requirement to provide mobile range training in realistic combat environments.  The Wideband Threat Emitter Kit, in conjunction with the Joint Threat Emitter (JTE) system, must provide realistic simulation of threats encountered in current combat environments.  

The Wideband Threat Emitter Kit must be a high-fidelity, wide-range, interchangeable, mobile threat simulator capable of illuminating aircraft and ships with pulsed signals ranging from 2 to 18 GHz.  The WBK must provide high-quality signal reproduction with minimal distortion, and threat emulation capabilities for a broad range of threats.   The WBK shall be exchangeable and transferable with existing JTE threat kits and any future kits designed for JTE.  While installed on the JTE system the WBK must be capable of relocating as part of the JTE system with minimal disassembly, the WBK components and equipment must be ruggedized and vibration-resistant.  

The Wideband Threat Emitter Kit needs to be a highly reliable and maintainable training system built with off-the-shelf components.  The WBK must capitalize on the existing Mobile Remote Emitter Simulator (MRES) antennas and transmitters to optimize commonality, maintainability and supportability on U.S. Navy and Michigan ANG ranges requiring the first WBKs.  The MRES antennas and transmitters must be capable of integrating with the JTE system for maximum threat capabilities.

The WTK will combine basic JTE Threat Emitter Unit (TEU), and MRES technology to create a system for unique requirements on Department of Defense (DoD) installations.  In the future, the U.S. Air Force may have requirements to procure complete Wideband Threat Emitter Systems that include a JTE-type system with the wideband capability.  

To provide optimum aircrew training and meet the needs of the U.S. Navy and Michigan ANG, the basic system design and configuration requires the WTK be able to fully integrate and operate with the data and software already developed on JTE.  Without any contractual development efforts, the WTK needs to be easily interchangeable, adaptable, integrated and compatible with the following JTE attributes which have already been developed and demonstrated: Command and Control Unit (C2U), Threat Emitter Unit (TEU) Pedestal, Combat Electromagnetic Environment Simulator (CEESIM), and Electronic Attack Receiver (EAR).  The JTE TEU signal Generator (CEESIM) software, the Range Data Integration Processor (RDIP) and the Mission Situation Awareness Terminal (MSAT) components of the C2U are required for the Wideband Kit to interface with the JTE system.  The contractor must demonstrate they have the ability and technology to interface the Wideband Kit with the current JTE C2U, TEU and EAR configurations for proper control and compatibility with the JTE system. 

Utilization of this primary technology is essential for Wideband Threat Emitter capabilities and its integration with JTE.  The following technical data and software, necessary for compatibility and adaptability to the JTE systems includes: 1). TEU Signal Generator (CEESIM) Technical Data 2). RDIP components of the C2U Control Subsystem Technical Data 3).  MSAT components of C2U control subsystem Control Subsystem Technical Data 4). TEU Signal Generator (CEESIM) Software 5). RDIP components of the C2U Control Subsystem Software 6). MSAT components of C2U control subsystem Control Subsystem Software.
 	
Since the Government may not have a competitive bid package (all of the data/drawings and software necessary to openly compete this), any interested parties must clearly identify (with supporting rationale) if they have the ability to meet the requirements without a competitive bid package from the Government.  
 
Each interested entity (that has the capability to produce the Wideband threat emitter kits identified above which are interchangeable, adaptable, integrated and compatible with the JTE) is requested to provide the following information to help the Air Force determine prospective contractors: 	
(1) Supporting rationale that they possess, very soon will possess, have formal 	      access to (e.g. formal business relationship with entity that does possess) all of the data, drawings, and other technology that is necessary for production of the Wideband Threat Emitter Kit identified above
(2) Supporting rationale as to why development would not need to be included on any resulting contract with your entity
(3) Supporting rationale of their ability to produce an entire system (WTK on a JTE platform)
(4) Information identified in previous paragraphs

The Department of the Navy (DoN), Commander, Navy Installations Command  (CNIC) (www.cni.navy.mil), is conducting preliminary planning to determine whether competitive sourcing, under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a076/a76_incl_tech_correction.html) and consistent with the President’s Management Agenda (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2002/mgmt.pdf), is the optimal methodology for sourcing their shore safety activities which include Navy Occupational Safety and Health (NAVOSH), Explosive Safety, Traffic Safety, Recreation and Off-Duty Safety.

In accordance with OMB Circular A-76 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10, market research is being conducted to seek industry assistance during preliminary planning in determining (1) the appropriate grouping of the shore safety activities as business units, consistent with market and industry structures, and (2) whether there is sufficient industry interest and demonstrated capability to compete for these activities to support a decision to pursue competitive sourcing as a strategic sourcing solution.     

This requirement involves providing Shore Safety Services, which include Navy Occupational Safety and Health (NAVOSH), Explosive Safety, Traffic Safety, and Recreation and Off-Duty Safety (RODS) as described below.  Firms are requested to participate by completing the survey at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil under solicitation number N62467-06-R-0091 and forwarding via email to the POC identified below NOT LATER THAN 4:00 PM Eastern Time, March 24, 2006.  You will need to register on the e-solicitations website in order to download the necessary documents.  Participation is voluntary; respondents will not be paid for participation.  

Small business sources will be considered in this research.  

A contract will NOT result from this market research, but one or more separate solicitations for the services described herein may be issued in the future.  

Research Method.  The method of conducting market research for this potential requirement is through such means as informal Internet searches, telephone interviews, and discussions with potential commercial sources and industry experts.  The questionnaire posted at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil has been specifically designed to focus on the scope of this research.  Note: This is to advise any commercial source providing information as part of this market research process that your information will not be used later as part of the evaluation process should you choose to submit a proposal in response to any solicitation that may result in the future.

<SUBJECT>26 -- TIRE PRIVATIZATION INDUSTRY DAY IAW THE 2005 BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE (BRAC) STATUTE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION NOTICE.  In accordance with the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) statute, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will issue a Request for Information on Monday, March 13, 2006. This Request for Information is available on the following web site, http://www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/tiremgmt .

The purpose of this Request for Information is to obtain industry input to be used in establishing a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) approach for the supply chain management of tires for the Department of Defense. Under the Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990, 10 U.S.C. 2687 note, the BRAC Commission’s recommendation to privatize the supply, storage and distribution for tires (Federal Supply Classes 2610, 2620, and 2630) became law on November 8, 2005.  This recommendation is intended to create a more responsive supply support to user organizations and deployment, and the sustainment of forces when deployed worldwide.  Privatization enables the Department to take advantage of the latest technologies, expertise, and business practices, which translate into improved support to customers at less cost.  This recommendation disestablishes the wholesale supply, storage, and distribution functions for all tires used by the Department of Defense, retaining only the supply contracting function.

<SUBJECT>26 -- TIRE PRIVATIZATION INDUSTRY DAY IAW THE 2005 BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE (BRAC) STATUTE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION NOTICE.  In accordance with the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) statute, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will issue a Request for Information on Monday, March 13, 2006. This Request for Information is available on the following web site, http://www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/tiremgmt .

The purpose of this Request for Information is to obtain industry input to be used in establishing a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) approach for the supply chain management of tires for the Department of Defense. Under the Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990, 10 U.S.C. 2687 note, the BRAC Commission’s recommendation to privatize the supply, storage and distribution for tires (Federal Supply Classes 2610, 2620, and 2630) became law on November 8, 2005.  This recommendation is intended to create a more responsive supply support to user organizations and deployment, and the sustainment of forces when deployed worldwide.  Privatization enables the Department to take advantage of the latest technologies, expertise, and business practices, which translate into improved support to customers at less cost.  This recommendation disestablishes the wholesale supply, storage, and distribution functions for all tires used by the Department of Defense, retaining only the supply contracting function. The Department will privatize these functions and will rely on private industry for the performance of supply, storage, and distribution of these commodities.  By doing so, the Department can divest itself of inventories and can eliminate infrastructure and personnel associated with these functions.  This Request for Information is for informational purposes only.  The Government will use this input to develop its acquisition strategy to address BRAC requirements.

<DESC>USAID/Armenia is seeking an international expert to work with UNDP and the group of national experts to develop 2006 National Human Development Report on Education.  
The international expert on education is responsible for providing research guidelines to national experts, summarizing research outcomes and presenting recommendations on Armenia’s education reform framework.  The expert will work with a team of five national experts and UNDP focal point for NHDR. 
The expert will also be responsible for drafting the final chapter of the Report that would summarize main issues of policy concerns and relevant policy recommendations.  He/she is expected to draw on international experience in education reforms, in particular, those in transition countries.
Background:
The objective of 2006 NHDR is to initiate a national debate on education in Armenia, and to promote the open society agenda by supporting broad public participation and civic engagement in public policy.  It is broadly believed that human capital and, in particular, education is key for Armenia’s development.  It is also believed that national debates and the role of open society agenda are very important for the success in education reforms.
The year 2006 is the year of Millennium Development Goals (MDG) nationalization/localization and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) review, which would bring revisions in education policy.  From another perspective, a major reform package in the education sector is being currently implemented in Armenia and the next waves of it are under consideration.  Thus, both USAID and UNDP believe that there is a momentum for discussing the strategic issues in education and initiating broad national debates.
It is expected that the 2006 NHDR on Education will be an important advocacy tool and knowledge asset for highlighting and addressing development needs in education, increasing public awareness, and policy review and adjustment.
The report will be a product of teamwork.  National experts working under the guidance of the international expert and UNDP country economist will draft the Report.  The expert will draft the last Chapter of the Report that summarizes policy findings and the recommendations.

•	Comment on the NHDR outline and recommend changes/additions, if needed;

•	Examine the gaps in data; and
•	Based on the identified gaps advise UNDP on conducting surveys.
Second Phase- drafting the Report:  The second phase includes drafting the report, circulating initial findings for commentary to key stakeholders, finalizing the report and policy recommendations.  In this phase the expert will:

In addition, the assignment will include the following tasks and activities:
•	Analysis of Government of Armenia’s policies and strategies in education sector, their implementation status, and effectiveness;
•	Consideration of relevant education sector successful policies and best practices implemented in other comparable regions, such as Europe & Eurasia, South America, etc.;

<DESC>Eglin Air Force Base, Florida intends to solicit and award a firm-fixed price for the purchase of one reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometry system.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a quotation is being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   The reference number is F1TBAP6040A100 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516 with a business standard size is 500 employees which will be set aside for small businesses.  Please identify your business size in your response based upon this standard.  CLIN 0001 will consist of the following information:  Basic configuration:  System components to be provided by the Vendor are *starred*, those to be provided by AFRL/MNME are identified as “government furnished equipment” or “GFE.”  The GFE will not be made available to the Vendor for testing.  The RTOFMS system will be contained within an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) compatible *Vacuum Enclosure* which will mate with an existing UHV Chamber (GFE) via a *Vacuum Adapter Chamber*.  All *Blank-Off Flanges* and at least one *Back-To-Air Valve* required to seal the assembly so the system may shipped under rough vacuum will be included.  In use at AFRL/MNME, all of these vacuum chambers will be evacuated by existing Turbopumps (GFE).  Electrically neutral atomic and molecular species produced in the GFE Chamber will enter the RTOFMS system *Ion Source* region, in which they can be ionized by a removable *Electron Gun*, or optionally after removing the electron gun by a Laser (GFE).  The system will include provisions for collecting, focusing, steering, and accelerating a “packet” of these ions down an electrostatically shielded *Flight Tube* towards a *Reflector Ion Mirror*; the system must include provisions for external triggering of this process by a TTL-level electrical signal.  The system will include a *First MicroChannel Plate (MCP) Detector* behind the Ion Mirror to facilitate system performance optimization, and to permit system operation as a linear TOFMS.  Ions reflected by the Ion Mirror will retransit the Vacuum Enclosure towards a *Second MCP Detector*.  The electrical signals at the outputs of the MCP detectors will be captured and recorded using an existing Data Acquisition System (GFE).  The RTOFMS system will include any and all *Power Supplies*, *Control Electronics*, and *Cables* necessary for operation using 120 VAC 60 Hz power.  Any *Software* required to control the functioning of the system must be compatible with a host Computer (GFE) running the Windows 2000 (GFE) or Windows XP (GFE) operating systems.  *Performance Test Data* demonstrating that the delivered system can meet the performance specifications defined below, including sample mass spectrometric data with relevant experimental parameters and instrumental settings, will be provided at the time of delivery.  Mechanical Dimensions:  The distance from the center of the Ion Source region to the First MCP Detector must be at least 36-inches; however, the overall assembled length of the Vacuum Enclosure and Vacuum Adapter Chamber must not exceed 60-inches.  The RTOFMS system must be capable of mating to a standard 6-inch ConFlat-style flange (hereafter referred to as “Flange A”) on a Gate Valve (GFE) attached to the side of the GFE Chamber.  The center of Flange A is located 12.0-inches above the Benchtop (GFE) and the axis of Flange A is oriented horizontally, that is, parallel to the GFE Benchtop.  The neutral atomic and molecular species will enter the Vacuum Adapter Chamber along this horizontal axis.  The RTOFMS Vacuum Enclosure will extend vertically above the GFE Benchtop; the weight of the entire RTOFMS system will be carried by an adjustable Support (GFE).  The Vacuum Adapter Chamber will comprise a six-way cross consisting of two pairs of opposing 6-inch ConFlat-style flanges, and one pair of opposing 2.75-inch ConFlat-style flanges.  The three axes joining the centers of the opposing flange pairs will be mutually perpendicular.  All six flanges must be aligned to view the Ion Source region at the center of the six-way cross.  A clear line of sight must exist from the center of Flange A, completely through the Ion Source region, to the center of the opposing 6-inch flange on the Vacuum Adapter Chamber.  With the Electron Gun removed, another clear line of sight must exist along the centers of the opposing 2.75-inch ConFlat-style flanges on the Vacuum Adapter Chamber.  The removable Electron Gun will be mounted on one of the 2.75-inch flanges on the Vacuum Adapter Chamber.  The RTOFMS Vacuum Enclosure must include a 6-inch ConFlat-style flange for attachment of a GFE Turbopump; this flange is in addition to those on the six-way Vacuum Adapter Chamber.  The RTOFMS Vacuum Enclosure must also include a 2.75-inch ConFlat-style flange for attachment of a UHV Gauge (GFE).  Both of these flanges must be oriented in the direction away from Flange A, to avoid conflicting with the existing GFE Chamber.  A sketch of the proposed system layout is available upon request.  Vendor will include a mechanical sketch of the entire system with correct external dimensions and relative component placements in their proposal.  All cables required for system operation will be at least 9-feet long.  System Performance:  All weld locations and welding operations will be performed in accord with good UHV practice.  The entire assembly will be helium leak tested with a minimum sensitivity of 1x10^-9 standard-cubic-centimeters/second.  The Vacuum Enclosure components will be cleaned and electropolished for high vacuum operation.  The Electron Gun must be capable of 70 eV electron impact ionization of gas-phase species.  The RTOFMS system will be capable of detecting the resulting ions with a resolution of at least 1000 over a mass-to-charge ratio range of 5-1000 Daltons.  Vendor will provide “typical” test data from similar previously manufactured systems for the purpose of source selection.    Serviceability and Warranty:  Vendor will clearly describe which parts are covered under their standard warranty, and the duration of the standard warranty.  Quantity is 1 each.   CLIN 0002 is for shipping costs.  Required delivery date for item is 90 days ARO.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-25.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO.3 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL EVACUATION SERVICES.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to dissolves the previously-noted total small business set-aside, clarifies the Best Value selection criteria applicable to this RFQ, revises the contractual Period of Performance, and establishes revised dates for submittal of questions and offers. 1.  The previously-noted total small-business set-aside is dissolved for this acquisition.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency regardless of business size. 2.  As previously noted, selection and award will be made to the offeror whose offer will be most advantageous to the Government.   The order of importance for the listed evaluation factors is as follows (highest to lowest):	Relevant past performance (especially regarding patient extractions from remote locations outside the United States), technical merit (especially regarding how timely medical evacuation will be assured under trained medical supervision), and price.	 Price evaluation will consider only that amount of an offeror’s price proposal representing a fixed minimum annual payment by NASA, even if no extractions are required.	Because the types and quantities of extractions cannot be identified and would be highly uncertain and speculative, NASA’s intent is to provide reimbursement of reasonable incremental costs incurred on its behalf for each actual extraction as noted in Amendment #2 question response #1. 3.  The Period of Performance is revised from 2 years from date of Award to 1 year from date of Award, with 4 one-year options for continued performance.  FAR	52.217-5, “Evaluation of Options”, and FAR 52.217-9, “Option to Extend the Term of the Contract” are included by reference in the RFQ. 4.  Offers in response to this revised RFQ are due by 4:00 pm EST on 3/21/06.  Contractual and technical questions regarding this RFQ may be submitted in writing to Andres Adorno via e-mail, no later than 4:00 pm EST on 3/16/06.  Offerors who submitted offers in response to the originally posted RFQ NNK06144209Q may withdraw, supplement, or replace the previously submitted offer provided such action is accomplished by the above listed revised RFQ due date. All other information provided under the subject RFQ remains in effect.  Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.

<DESC>This amendment answers the following questions and extends the closing date to March 16, 2006 at 10:00 a.m.


Question 1.  Regarding the 60” plasma screen Kiosk. There are at least three ways we are familiar with handling a kiosk with this size screen. 

1.	A 60” touch screen where the user simply walks up and interacts with the screen 
2.	A 60” screen (no touch) on a stand or mount with a 17” ELO touch screen 5 to 8’ in front mounted into a podium-style kiosk (waist-high for ADA compliance). The user touches the 17” ELO and that changes the content on the plasma 
3.	A kiosk like the 17” you’ve specified but with the addition of a 60” screen above so others can see what the user is doing... Or to attract people to come up and interact. Similar to #2, but in closer proximity.

Based on the fact that this is a lobby setting and the 60” is meant to educate and entertain, we’re recommending #2 as the most interactive, aesthetically pleasing and best longevity in a high-traffic environment.

None of these choices negatively imposes on the software development, but knowing which you’d prefer would be helpful as we work to finalize the information for our response to this RFP. 

Response 1.  The plasma does not have to be equipped with touch screen capability. The plasma will be used primarily for educational purposes & not for interactive programs.


Question 2.  Is electricity available for the Kiosks, or will we be required to get an electrician to handle this?
Response 2.  Power is already established in the areas where the kiosk & plasma are to be located.

Question 3.  How many touch screen pages will there be?

Response 3.  We have just started to develop content & are working with several Program Offices on the types of presentations that may present on the kiosk.  

Question 4.  How many videos will be included?  What are their sizes?

Response 4.  We have just started to develop content & are working with several Program Offices on the types of presentations that may present on the kiosk.  The videos we run are of file type .wmv, they usually run about 3 to15 mins and range in file size from 14MB to 300Mb. To date, all of them have been run directly from the media (CD drive).

Question 5.  Is all of the content ready to be provided to the vendor (images, etc)?

Response 5.  We have just started to develop content & are working with several Program Offices on the types of presentations that may present on the kiosk.

Question 6.  Also, the RFQ mentions "a stainless steel kiosk"? Is that the required material or simply a look that you are shooting for? I ask because stainless steel and Plasma screens do not work well together due to solid state electrical conflicts. Can you look into this for me?

Response 6.  The kiosk & plasma screen both need to have a stainless steel OR polished aluminum "look".

Question 7.  Is the April 30 delivery a firm date?  

Response 7.  The April 30 delivery date is the desired date, alternate delivery dates will be accepted and evaluated.  

Question 8.  Is there any restriction on the database?  Is SQL okay for use?

Response 8.  The vendor will be responsible for totally supporting and maintaining any software that they provide for these kiosks. The Government does not anticipate the need for the kiosks.  If one is required, the standard at EPA is Oracle database software.  However, we will not specify/require a specific database, as we don't anticipate having any interaction with it.
