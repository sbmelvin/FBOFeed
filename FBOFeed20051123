<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services from University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii (Dr. Joshua Jacobs) on a sole source basis.

Period of Performance will be for a 6 month period beginning from the date of award.

Professional services are required over a 6-month period to generate data for explicit process evaluation and technology assessment of the use of a handheld computer application, MD on Tap for real-time access to MEDLINE to answer clinical questions raised at the point of service, evaluation of the ability of the MD on Tap application to be an effective interface to MEDLINE in clinical settings, and evaluation of the role of MEDLINE in answering such questions. Specifically, two or more trained medical Residents under the supervision of a medical educator are required to accompany medical teams on teaching rounds, recognize and describe the clinical scenario, the clinical questions raised, search MEDLINE for answers to the questions using MD on Tap and indicate those MEDLINE citations that are relevant to the question. In addition, facilities in which to conduct the data generation are required, specifically a clinical care teaching environment associated with a medical school. The environment shall have access to a variety of clinical care scenarios, questions generated from the teaching environment, and Internet network service at the point of care via a wireless (802.11b/g compatible or cell phone connected) infrastructure. The medical Residents shall have broad medical expertise adequate to describe and categorize medical scenarios, recognize questions arising in the clinical care environment, formulate search terms and conditions related to the questions, and search the MEDLINE citation database for potential answers to the questions raised.  

Proposed Work: The fieldwork will be conducted by two or more Medical Residents from the Joan A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM), University of Hawaii, for a total of 8 or more person-weeks of data generation. Each Resident shall conduct the following sub-tasks: 1)	Training: Learn to use the MD on Tap client on a PDA or PDA/cell phone. Become proficient in using the application for searching MEDLINE for citations that contain information relevant to answering clinical questions raised at the point of service. Become familiar with all its functions. Become proficient in using the notes function to record necessary reminders of the clinical scenario. Learn to use the transaction review program to assist in writing the daily summaries.
2) Fieldwork: Accompany JABSOM medical teams on teaching rounds for 4 weeks (20 days), not as a member of the medical team, but as an observer. Make note of all clinical scenarios and clinical questions using the MD on Tap notes function. Use MD on Tap to search for citations that address any clinical questions that arise at the point of care, excluding questions concerning individual patient data. Use the save function of MD on Tap to identify those citations that are judged to be relevant to the question. The Residents will record the questions and search for answers even when the Resident already knows the answer. It is expected that the Residents explore all of the features of the MD on Tap application in order to access the usefulness of each.
3) Daily Summaries: Submit by email to the NLM MD on Tap team daily summaries of the scenarios, clinical questions (or PICO), EBM task category, who asked the question, MEDLINE searches, relevant citations (PMIDs) and comments. The summaries will be in an Excel spreadsheet that contains these fields: Approximate time, scenario, Question or PICO, Who asked, EBM task category, Relevant PMIDs, Comments. These will be reviewed and corroborated by MD on Tap personnel. The Residents will be available, at times to be determined, to consult with MD on Tap personnel to discuss any ambiguous associations or confusing elements of the summary. 4) Final Report: Following the 4-weeks of use, prepare a final report that will include a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the ability to find relevant evidence in MEDLINE using MD on Tap at the point of care, a discussion of the features of MEDLINE searching (for example: limits, clinical queries), and the current features of MD on Tap (for example: history, EBM clusters) that are most useful for quickly finding useful citations, and any additional features that could facilitate that process. 

All Residents will be mentored by JABSOM faculty Dr. Joshua Jacobs. Dr. Jacobs will be responsible for coordinating the work of the JABSOM personnel involved in the study, for supervision of the Residents in the training, fieldwork and reporting phases of the study. Dr. Jacobs will insure technical support and access to medical facilities and teams on teaching rounds during the study. 

The rationale for requiring the fieldwork to take place during teaching rounds is to insure an environment in which the Residents are exposed to numerous and varied clinical scenarios wherein clinical questions are raised. It is expected that the Residents will be sufficiently knowledgeable in clinical medicine, in the practice of Evidence based Medicine and in the use of MD on Tap to be able to recognize all potential clinical questions, be able to generate suitable MEDLINE queries to find citations relevant to the clinical question and be able to determine which citations are relevant to answering the questions or are for articles that are likely to be relevant. Thus the Residents can accompany the teams on rounds without requiring interaction with the team members, either to understand the question or access the relevance of the citations.

Technical Support: The Residents must have full time access to a Palm OS or PocketPC-based PDA. The PDA device may be a wireless PDA-only platform, such as a Tungsten C or an HP iPAQ, or it may be a PDA/cell phone with Internet access, such as a Treo 650. There must be a mechanism to guarantee that the Residents will have wireless access to the Internet during the teaching rounds and at the point of care. The access may be via 802.11x Local Area Network, or via a cell phone service provider. The chosen device must be provided by the Residents or by JABSOM.

Approximate Schedule: a) Training Schedule: The time spent in training will depend upon the Residents' previous experience using PDAs and his/her learning speed. It is expected that the Residents will achieve proficiency in using MD on Tap prior to beginning the fieldwork phase. Proposed training interval: December 1-31, 2005. b)  Field Work Schedule: Four weeks constituting the JABSOM Medical Informatics Elective, or an equivalent number of days. The objective is to record many actual clinical scenarios. Proposed dates: January through March, 2006. c)  Final Report Schedule: The final report to NLM is due within two weeks of the end of the fieldwork. Proposed date: March, 2006.

The NLM MD on Team will provide: a) Training assistance, if needed. NLM can supply examples of clinical questions and MD on Tap searches. NLM can supply documentation for using MD on Tap, and will provide one-on-one assistance via email or teleconferencing in the use of MD on Tap. b)	A special version of MD on Tap tailored to support the fieldwork. The special version will support the use of a UserID that will be transmitted with each MD on Tap transaction. The special version will include a Notes function wherein the Resident fieldworker can record and send freeform notes regarding clinical scenarios and questions. These can be used to assist in preparing the daily summaries, as will be explained in the next paragraph. 
c) A special transaction review program to assist in preparing the daily summaries. This web-based program is to be run on a desktop computer. It displays in chronological order a review of all transactions for the given UserID, including the day and time of the transaction. These transactions include the optional Notes, the MEDLINE searches, and any citations that were viewed on the PDA. The display includes hyperlinks to PubMed to re-do the search, or to view the citation, and hyperlinks to the full text of a citation, if the full URL is available. 

Communications: Because of the six hour time difference between Maryland and Hawaii, all parties are expected to rely heavily on frequent email exchanges to inform each other of progress or problems. These will be supplemented by occasional telephone discussions or teleconferences. If there are gaps in or unexplained interruptions of the regular use of MD on Tap or daily summaries, the Residents and/or Dr, Jacobs will contact the MD on Tap Team within 36 hours of the interruption with a justification.

REQUIRED TASKS

The work described in the Proposed Work section shall be completed. The subtasks for each Resident are summarized here:

Task description

Subtask 1:  If necessary, learn to use MD on Tap to search MEDLINE. Learn to use all of its functions. Learn to use the transaction tracking software. 
Subtask 2: Round with teaching teams, recording all scenarios and clinical questions, using MD on Tap to search for answers to the questions, mark relevant MEDLINE citations.
Subtask 3: Submit daily summaries my email to the MD on Tap team of the activities conducted in subtask 2, organized into the fields named above in an Excel spreadsheet.
Subtask 4: Write and submit a final report, including an overall evaluation of the MD on Tap system.

Evaluation criteria for contract award : 1) A Professor of Medicine with experience conducting research, experience in medical informatics and experience in the incorporation of portable computing technology into the teaching and practice of medicine, who can supervise two or more residents in conducting fieldwork and insure both technical support and access to medical facilities and teams on teaching rounds. 2) Two or more individuals with medical expertise at the level of medical Resident or better, with experience in the practice of Evidence Based Medicine, experience using handheld computers, and with the ability to schedule at least 4 weeks at a full time level to the fieldwork portion of the contract, to be supervised by a Professor of Medicine.
3) Access for the Residents to a clinical medical care teaching environment in which they may accompany medical teams on teaching rounds as an observer without playing any essential role in the team. 4) Reliable access to the Internet from a wireless handheld computer (a WiFi PDA or a PDA/cell phone) using the Palm or PocketPC operating system within the teaching environments visited by the medical teams.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine to procure Agitator software from Agitar Software, Inc., 1350 Villa Street, Mountain View, California, 94041, on a sole source basis for the National Institutes of Health, Office of Extramural Research, OER.  This proprietary software will assist the OER’s software development teams to implement developer testing.  OER has determined that this Agitator software is the only know software available to assist with the automation of their development testing to improve the software quality of the applications of development testing as well as improving the monitoring and managing of the testing efforts.  

 

Software agitation, pioneered by Agitar, is an automated way of testing code. The software will exercises the code with a wide variety of automatically generated input data, determines the behavior of the classes and reports its observations automatically.  Agitar’s Agitator is able to construct the most complex of objects automatically.  The software can provide a  specialized setup or input data, the Agitator includes an extensive library of factories that can be configured with point-and-click simplicity. Agitator includes specialized factories for J2EE and database applications.  This feature will allow the developers to add custom factories for specific application. All of these factories become durable test assets that can be shared across your organization.  The problem of combinatorial explosion is a well known problem with software testing. The Agitator software will help solve this problem by testing every combination automatically. Agitator uses dynamic analysis of the software under test, including code coverage analysis, to ensure that all branches of the code are exercised automatically.   Agitation can often achieve 100% code coverage with no manual intervention.   The Agitator automatically detects changes to the code and adjusts its approach to accommodate those changes, saving time and reducing the risk of untested code.  Agitar's Agitator can replace real collaborator objects with mock objects/factories on-the-fly without having to modify code-under-test.  The Agitator includes a Management Dashboard that helps to direct the testing to a point where it will be most effective and integrates Agitar assertion outcomes, JUnit outcomes and code metrics into a single management report.

<DESC>Notice of Intent The United States Department of Energy (DOE), Oak Ridge Office (ORO), on behalf of the Portsmouth/Paducah Project Office (PPPO), plans to contract by means other than full and open competition.  ORO intends to negotiate an extension to the current contract (DE-AC05-01OR22877) with the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) to transition from the preservation of the uranium enrichment capability to permanent cold shutdown at DOEâ€™s Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PORTS).  The period of performance will be an additional three years (base year and two one-year option periods) added to the current contract.  The estimated value of this contract extension is approximately $210,000,000 based on $70,000,000 per year for Fiscal Years (FY) 2006 through FY 2008.  This effort will prepare the site for the Decontamination and Decommissioning (D&D) of the facilities which will be competitively procured. DOE previously determined that reserve production capacity for the enrichment of uranium was needed at PORTS.  In order to do this, portions of the plant (and spare equipment) were placed in cold standby, which entailed placing certain process equipment in a non-energized, non-enriching mode.  In accordance with a determination to end cold standby, the facilities can now be transitioned to a cold shutdown mode consistent with plans to D&D the facilities.  Shutdown activities will include safety and maintenance activities that are similar in nature to those of cold standby, particularly the performance of surveillance and maintenance of equipment required to ensure protection of the general public, facility and worker safety, regulatory compliance functions, and shutdown of non-essential systems to lower infrastructure costs, and reducing overall facility hazards.  The essential services required to meet the Agencyâ€™s needs include: â€¢  Continue surveillance and maintenance activities essential for nuclear criticality safety/radiological safety and documented facility safety requirements; â€¢  Continue site infrastructure, utilities, and security services essential to multiple user site operations and national security; â€¢  Ongoing removal of unsafe material deposits, flammable liquids, and environmentally sensitive materials (e.g., PCB liquids) needed to support reduction of facility hazards and accelerate the transition to D&D. The use of other than full and open competition for the proposed action is authorized by 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1).  This section provides that full and open competition need not be obtained when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of services will satisfy agency requirements. USEC is the sole lessee of the PORTS enrichment facilities under exclusive rights provided pursuant to the USEC Privatization Act and possesses the only Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) certificate to operate the uranium enrichment facilities.  Currently, only USEC possesses approved programs and procedures and certified personnel for performing surveillance and maintenance activities within an approved NRC regulatory framework at PORTS. Firms who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates your firmâ€™s ability to provide an equivalent service and rationale as to why they should be considered, as described above.  All interested firms must respond by 2:00 PM (EST), December 12, 2005, to Jeff Burgan, AD-424, U.S. Department of Energy, 200 Administration Rd., Oak Ridge, TN  37830.  Email: burganjr@oro.doe.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract extension is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No reimbursement for any costs connected with providing the capability information will be provided by DOE.

<DESC>The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Service Center intends to award an interim or "bridge" supplemental agreement to contract DE-AC52-05NA26345 for a period of two months for security protective force services and other security-related services for the NNSA Nevada Site Office (NSO).  The services will be performed at the Nevada Test Site; Las Vegas, NV area NNSA/NSO facilities; contractor facilities; and other designated facilities.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented under FAR 6.302-1 (a), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The interim supplemental agreement is required pending completion of two competitive follow-on acquisitions:  a full and open competition for Security Protective Force Services (solicitation No. DE-RP52-05NA14390) and a small business set-aside for Security System Services (solicitation No. DE-RP52-05NA99344).  Contract DE-AC52-05NA26345 with Wackenhut Services, Inc. (WSI) will end on December 31, 2005.  No other firm has the requisite knowledge and experience to perform these highly specialized security services without interruption on January 1, 2006.  WSI has the requisite number of key and non-key personnel possessing the required security clearances.  This unique working environment necessitates the award of an interim supplemental agreement to the incumbent contractor, WSI.  The intent of this sole source procurement is to provide the required support services from January 1, 2006 until the award and/or transition of the follow-on acquisitions.  Note 22 applies.

With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.

Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation.

<CONTACT>Aaron Ford, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-254-6375, Fax 202-254-5398, Email Aaron.Ford1@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate, Office of Systems Engineering and Development, Community Based Cyber Security (CBCS) Program, has a requirement on a sole-source basis, to build state and local preparedness for cyber security incidents through a comprehensive needs assessment, expert panel analysis, and technical assistance initiative combining the expertise and resources of relevant Federal agencies, state and local stakeholders, academia, and private sector representatives.  To support this requirement, the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate, Office of Systems Engineering and Development, Community Based Cyber Security (CBCS) Program, intends to establish a Cost, No Fee contract with Eastern Kentucky University (EKU), Public Safety and Security Institute for Technology (PSITEC), 521 Lancaster Avenue Richmond, KY 40475.  This contract will be awarded on the basis of 41 United States Code 253 (c) (1) — only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The CBCS Program is a jointly managed effort between Science and Technology Directorate and the DHS Office of Domestic Preparedness (ODP).  EKU is the current project coordinator for the CBCS Program under the DHS ODP FY 2005 Homeland Security Preparedness Technical Assistance Program (HSPTAP).  EKU has been awarded a grant from ODP to initiate the CBCS Program and satisfy ODP’s scope of technical requirements.  Its continued role as the lead contractor in support of Science and Technology Directorate’s technical requirements is critical in order to allow DHS and the CBCS Program to leverage institutional knowledge and maintain coordinated operations.  EKU is the only entity with the technical expertise, CBCS Program knowledge, and current team members to successfully meet the goals, milestones, and outcomes of the program.  EKU is the current project coordinator for the CBCS Program in support of the DHS ODP under HSPTAP.  EKU has been awarded a grant from ODP to initiate the CBCS Program and to satisfy ODP’s scope of technical requirements.  In this capacity, EKU is solely responsible for the management of the CBCS needs assessment and expert panel analysis activities being conducted in the first two phases of this program and has a clear understanding of the tasks necessary to develop and provide the subsequent technical assistance services required under this contract.  There are no other contractors that have this combination of technical experience and CBCS Program knowledge.  In addition, EKU has already assembled a group of subcontractors and consultants to support the CBCS Program, including the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC); the CyberScience Laboratory (CSL) in Rome, New York; and G&H International Services.  The team contains organizations and key individuals who have extensive experience/working relationships with key parties involved in the issue.  This relationship is instrumental in the current success of this project by allowing EKU to obtain the necessary tools and information it requires to complete its deliverables.  It is not programmatically/economically feasible for another Contractor to form a parallel team of subject matter experts to meet the Science and Technology Directorate’s technical requirements when the current team is in place.  Furthermore, EKU is the only logical entity capable of satisfying the expanded requirements.  Its continued role as the lead contractor in support of the Science and Technology Directorate’s technical requirements will allow DHS and CBCS Program to leverage the institutional knowledge and maintain coordinated operations.  The transition of this program to another Contractor will increase programmatic risk, result in the loss of critical organization and individual participation, and degrade the final deliverable quality controls due to transition challenges between the three phases of the program.  This synopsis is being issued for information purposes only.  The notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  Solicitation documents are NOT available.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.  Any questions concerning this message should be directed to the Contracting Officer at Aaron.Ford1@dhs.gov

L3 Communications, Power Systems Group is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and is the only source for the equipment drawings to produce O/A 20368 kits.  Drawings are owned by PSG and it would not be economical for any manufacturer to buy the drawings from PSG and manufacture kits for a lower price.  As the OEM, PSG designed and developed the ACSSFC.  PSG maintains the production capability as well as unique tooling, jigs, and fixtures necessary to complete the task.   Note 12, 22, and 26 apply.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego, intends to award a sole source contract with a cost plus fixed fee pricing arrangement to Applied Research Associates, Inc., (ARA) of Albuquerque, New Mexico. The contractor will research, analyze and develop the global radiological and nuclear (RN) countermeasure architecture necessary to prevent or deter a RN attack with an emphasis on pre-event detection and reporting. The contractor will develop a system-of-systems analysis methodology for the global radiological and nuclear threat countermeasure architecture and provide architecture recommendations to the Government. In addition, the contractor will implement a complete information technology enabled radiological and nuclear countermeasure system architecture, design and fabricate prototype systems to utilize and interface with existing detection systems, and develop plans for deployment, training, operation, maintenance and sustainment of the systems. This work includes analysis of the currently deployed countermeasure architecture, extensions in scale and scope of the current architecture and future architectures defined by the Government or developed by the contractor. The estimated period of performance is from date of award to 15 October 2006. This effort is a follow-on to contract N66001-05-C-6006 with ARA that was awarded under the competitive broad agency announcement BAA 04-01 "BAA for Radiological and Nuclear countermeasure System Architectures Analysis" issued by the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency. Through the initial contract effort, ARA has begun the research and follow-on actions will implement the system architecture that is critically needed for homeland security. The use of any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that could not be recovered through competition as well as unacceptable delays in fulfilling vital security requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposals. See notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisition Centers (COAC) has a requirement for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to negotiate and award a purchase order for one (1) each, Silencer Human Druggable Genome Sirna Library.  This Library is a collection of 16,485 duplex RNA oligonucleotides that inhibits the expression of 5495 different genes when transfected into cells.  The NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) is part of the Molecular Libraries Screening Center Network (MLSCN) that consists of nine extramural centers.  NCGC will use this library to identify genes involved in particular cell-based assays and discover targets that interact with molecular probes isolated from high throughput screens.  Independently, not as an agent of the Government, the contractor must furnish the material with the following siRNA library requirements: 1) Double stranded RNA oligo, composed of 19 complementary RNA nucleotides followed by a two DNA nucleotide overhang at the 3' end.  2) Must be composed of siRNAs directed against 5495 specific genes; three siRNSa per gene target, totaling 16,485 siRNAs.  3) Each siRNA will be designed to trget all RefSeq transcripts associated with a particular gene, as devided by the NCBI Entrez Gene database.  4) siRNAs will be designed using an algorithm that incorporates features that have been proven to closely correlate with efficacy, including but not limited to: a) The presence of higher G/C contents at certain residues near the 3' end of the antisense strand, and lower G/C content at certain residues near the 5' end of the antisense strand; b) The presence of higher G/C contents at certain residues near the 3' end of the Tm of specific internal domains of the siRNA; c) Position of the target sequence within the (CDS) coding region; d) Nucleotide content of the 3' overhangs; e) Avoidance of CpG motifs and of known SNPs.  5) For each target in the library, at least two out of the three siRNAs directed against the gene must specifically reduce target mRNA levels by 70% or more when transfected under appropriate conditions at 100 nM and when target mRNA levels are measured 48 hours later by qunatitative RT-PCR.  6) At least 80% of each siRNA oligo must be full length.  7) Each siRNA oligo must be cartridge purified to at least 90% purity and determined to be within 0.3% of the theoretical mass as analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (to confirm the correct composition andfull deprotection).  8) Each set of complementary siRNAs must be annealed and then analyzed by PAGE to ensure the presence of duplexed molecules of the expected size and the absence of significant amounts of un-annealed molecules.  After annealing, 0.25 nmol of each final siRNA duplex is needed.  9) The siRNAs must not be pooled, rather siRNAs must be arrayed as one siRNA per well into 384 well microtiter plates.   The siRNAs to the same target shall be provided in separate plates in the same well location.  The first and last columns of each plate will remain empty.  The siRNAs Library must be available within two (2) weeks from the date of award of the contract.  This requirement is under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 325998 with a size standard 500 employees.

TITLE:  Tangram:  A Fully Automated, Continuously Operating, Intelligence Analysis Support System 

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA # 06-04-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 should be submitted by 15 Dec 05; FY 07 by 1 Oct 06; FY 08 by 1 Oct 07 and, FY 09 by 1 Oct 08 and FY10 by 30 Sep 09.  White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 Sep 10, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section V of this announcement for further details.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

This BAA seeks research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the area of Intelligence and analytic support systems.

The Intelligence Community and the Air Force routinely sponsor classified and unclassified research to advance the state of the art in intelligence and analytic support systems. To date, many of these programs have focused on developing systems, tools and algorithms to detect international terrorist activities and planned events of interest.  By relying on highly accurate and analyst-vetted knowledge about known terrorists, groups, affiliations, and activities these tools and methods have proven to be very effective at tracking terrorist suspects and detecting their threat event intentions.  In total, these programs have resulted in the development and evaluation of several methods of detecting and searching for patterns of terrorist behaviors, representing these behaviors in human and machine interpretable form and efficiently searching large data stores for evidence of known behaviors.  Significant effort has been invested in improving the performance and scalability of the most promising algorithms, often resulting in two orders of magnitude increase in scalability and four orders of magnitude speed-up in compute time.  However, the total production time for a single answer is currently measured in days and weeks.  To have any demonstrable improvement in the intelligence process we need to provide answers in hours or minutes.   Several fundamental challenges remain before the technology can be deployed broadly within the Intelligence Community.  The four key challenges that define the essence of the Tangram program are:

Reduce system and data configuration time of all automated entity and threat discovery processes by two orders of magnitude (100 x).
Reduce threat entity and event discovery time by two orders of magnitude (100 x).

Increase overall efficiency by three orders of magnitude and overall productivity by two orders of magnitude over current processes while delivering a consistently high intelligence value as determined by experienced analysts.

Improve the detection of low observable threats and events where guilt by association assumptions may not apply. 

The fundamental technologies developed under previous programs have been evaluated through peer review and technical evaluations. There is no debate that these technologies are capable of filling an important void in the Intelligence Community's analytic arsenal. However, to achieve their potential, we must develop the processes, procedures and standards to deploy a fully automated, analytic system capable of processing tens of thousands of simultaneous analytic inquiries in an efficient and scalable manner. To achieve this, the data, algorithms, and computing resources must be flexible and adaptable.  Essentially, the system must be self composing because of the variety and unpredictability of the questions to be answered.

Tangram is unique in that it takes a systematic view of the process; applying what is now a set of disjointed technologies that are difficult for non-technical users to apply, cumbersome to configure into a self–configuring, continuously operating system.

Tangram is envisioned as a fully automated, continuously operating, intelligence analysis support system that's capable of configuring itself to achieve a reasonable tradeoff between estimated intelligence value and cost, where:

Analysis Support means the production of hypotheses representing an adversary's intentions, methods, logistics support or intended targets based on: 1) behavioral patterns, relationships or context that are expressed only in data and, 2) analyst feedback about prior hypotheses.

Configuring itself means the system is aware of the data characteristics, algorithm capabilities and requirements, and hardware resources such that it can reason how best to produce an answer.

Reasonable means good is enough, optimal is not required.

Intelligence Value is a subjective score or estimate of the intelligence utility of a hypotheses produced by the system.

Cost is the effort required to produce an answer and the opportunity cost of not producing a higher intelligence value product using the same system resources.

This BAA seeks research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the following areas: 1) System Research, 2) Component Research, and 3) Gap Filling Research, and 4) System Evaluation Architecture (SEA).  Additional details regarding these areas are detailed in the TANGRAM Proposer's Information Packet (PIP) and other documents which can be found at https://extranet.if.afrl.af.mil/programs/TANGRAM/TANGRAM-extra.html.  Offerors wishing to propose in more than one area should submit separate white papers and proposals.

II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $49M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 06 - $8M; FY 07 - $12M; FY 08 - $12M; FY 09 - $12M; and FY10 - $5M.  

Offerors should make a genuine effort to estimate their actual costs for their research efforts and not attempt to use estimates of the number of awards and total program budget to guess at a realistic cost.  When evaluating cost realism and reasonableness the Government will take this into consideration.

For the System Research area, two awards are anticipated for a period not exceeding 48 months with go/no-go decisions at 24 months.  However, the Government may consider a single System Research award to an offeror. Any exceptionally strong system prototype proposal that demonstrates a solid understanding of the problem, proposes a technical approach with well managed risks, has an exceptionally proven team and the capabilities to transition their technology into classified  environments will be considered for a single award. Each award is not expected to be less than $3M per year.  For the Component Research, awards will not normally exceed 24 months with dollar amounts ranging from $250K to $2M per year.  For the System Evaluation Architecture (SEA), a single award not to exceed 48 months with dollar amounts ranging from $500K to $1.0M per year is anticipated.  For the Gap Filling Research, awards will not normally exceed 48 months with dollar amounts ranging from $150K to $750K per year.  The government plans to restrict the SEA award winner from also being awarded a System Research or Component Research award.

Teaming:  AFRL anticipates awards to integrated team(s) to achieve the desired technical capabilities for the System Research technical area, the Component Research areas, and the System Evaluation Architecture (SEA) area.  Individual awards are anticipated for the Gap Filling Research areas. Teams may have any organizational structure capable of performing the work.  However, when a team is structured, a specific individual and institution with overall responsibility for team performance must be identified.

Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. 

The anticipated start date for the FY 06 efforts under the solicitation is May 2006.

IV. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION:

1.  ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS:   All potential applicants are eligible.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting office focal point, Lori Smith, Contracting Officer, telephone (315) 330-1955 or e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding.

VI. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance,  will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:  (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - Including understanding the problem,  the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology, integration approach, and appropriate levels of readiness at yearly intervals, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3)  Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Cost Realism, Reasonableness, and Project Management Plan - The overall estimated costs should be clearly justified and appropriate for the technical complexity of the effort.  Evaluation will consider the value of the research to the government and the extent to which the proposed management plan details the capabilities necessary to effectively manage the team and allocate resources to achieve the capabilities proposed.   Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. 

VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white paper/proposals will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VIII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after whitepaper/proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

AFRL intends to team with one or more U.S. intelligence agencies, and may desire that proposers selected for award would perform in collaboration with those agencies.  Key Performers of prospective awardees whose activities would involve collaboration with the Intelligence Community must hold a current Top Secret Department of Defense (DoD) clearance and be approved for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.  A sufficient number of non-key performers to enable the effective accomplishment of the proposed research effort must also hold a Top Secret DoD clearance with SCI access, or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.  In addition, prospective awardees whose activities would be associated with the Intelligence Community must also possess a current DoD Top Secret Facility clearance and an approved SCI Facility (SCIF). Proposers desiring consideration for awards involving collaboration with the Intelligence Community shall identify key personnel and enabling support staff satisfying the above Top Secret DoD clearance and SCI access requirement; shall certify their DoD Top Secret Facility clearance; and, shall detail their organization's approach to maintaining separation of unclassified and classified activities, and controlling need-to-know. 

3.  REPORTING:    Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through our web-based reporting system known as JIFFY.  Prior to award the offeror will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

<DESC>The Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has a requirement for services from a qualified source to provide the necessary personnel, material, equipment, and facilities not otherwise provided by the Government, to characterize naturally occurring avian paramyxoviruses (APV) and identify strains suitable for further development as vaccine vectors to express antigens of highly pathogenic agents for human immunization.  The contractor will support intramural NIAID pre-clinical research work to identify APV that are infectious and attenuated in non-human primates acting as surrogates of humans, that are not highly pathogenic in birds, that replicate in Vero cells, and that can be made into recombinant form and engineered to express antigens of highly pathogenic human viruses to induce satisfactory immune responses in non-human primates.

 

Specifically, the Contractor shall: prepare working pools of APV (in particular avian parainfluenza viruses and avian metapneumoviruses); characterize each APV strain with regard to replication in vitro; perform antigenic analysis; prepare biologically cloned virus suspensions; perform replication and pathogenicity in birds and embryonated eggs; perform replication in hamsters; support LID/NIAID primate studies; perform sequence analysis; perform reverse genetic studies; support construction and analysis of APV-based vectored vaccines; complete studies with highly pathogenic agents; deliver results and materials; and maintain records and biological materials.

 

Offerors will be evaluated on the experience and capabilities of professional and technical personnel that would be assigned to this project; established capability for laboratory work and animals testing (rodents or chickens) at ABSL-2 and ABSL-3; and experience with viral infection of animals and virus isolation from animals at ABSL-2 and ABSL-3. The Offeror must also have, or be able to obtain, Select Agent approval for work with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (e.g., H5 and H7) as well as approval by the United States Department of Agriculture for work with the above-mentioned highly pathogenic avian viruses as well as with Newcastle disease virus mesogenic strains.  The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available electronically on/about July 22, 2005, and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps Home Page at www.fedbizopps.gov. 

 

It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement type award will be made on or about December 1, 2005, for a base year, including options for five additional years.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Dufour, Rene, 49-621-487-3376
<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) FOR SUPPORT SERVICES TO U.S ARMY, EUROPE FOR PERSONNEL RECOVERY (PR) 										30 Sept 2005 1.0	General. 1.1  Background. The USAREUR Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3 has responsibility under Headquarters, United States Army Europe for operations and planning functions for U.S. Army, Europe.  The G-3 serves as the lead in developing and reviewing operational concepts for Army, Join t, and multinational operations as part of the component command of EUCOM.  The G-3 monitors and reports on Army Europe current operations and readiness, and serves as the Army Component for EUCOM to focus Army assets in support of providing trained and re ady forces to the combatant commanders.  The G-3 is the focal point for prioritization, integration, and synchronization of decisions for the Army Europe Warfighter.  The G-3 also is the focal point for organization, integration, decision-making, and execu tion of the spectrum of activities encompassing requirement definition, force development, force integration, force structuring, combat developments, training developments, and resourcing for personnel recovery for this command. The Department of Defense (DoD) directed a review of DoD plans and policies regarding Personnel Recovery in October 1998, and in 1999 subsequently revised the DoD Directive (DODD) 2310.2 and the accompanying Instruction (DODI) 2310.3, formulated the Person nel Recovery Advisory Group (PRAG), the Personnel Recovery Technical Working Group (PRTWG), and the Personnel Recovery Response Cell (PRCC) during execution of Personnel Recovery missions, in order to coordinate DoD, agencies, regional Commander, Services,  and Joint Staff, efforts and responsibilities.  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff revised his coordinating instruction (CJCSI) 3270.01 in 1999. Personnel Recovery (PR) is the umbrella term for operations focused on the task of recovering captured, missing, or isolated personnel from danger.  PR is the sum of military, diplomatic, and civil efforts to effect the recovery and return of US military, DOD civilians, and DOD contractor personnel who are isolated or missing while participating in a US Government-sanctioned military activity or missions in an uncertain or hostile environment, or as determined by the Secretary of Defense.  Recovery may occu r through military action, action by non-governmental organizations, other U.S. Government-approved actions, or through any combination of these, as described in DODD 2310.2.  The mission includes reporting, locating, supporting, recovering, and returning isolated personnel to duty and their families.  Personnel Recovery does not include hostage rescue or other counter-terrorist rescue missions, nor does it include non-combatant evacuation operations (NEO). 	With the 1999 revision of DODD 2310.02, SecDef, per DRID 29, tasked the Commander, Joint Forces Command (JFCOM) as the Executive Agent, responsible for all aspects of the Personnel Recovery mission, except policy oversight.  The Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) for FY2002-2005 states that: A robust personnel recovery capability contributes directly to protecting the U.S. forces. DoD should continue to develop fully integrated personnel recovery architecture. To ensure that the DoD meets this goal, emphasis on PR must continue to increase thr oughout the force. DoD must broaden coordination among its components and establish and enhance cooperative ties with the interagency community on PR matters. The Services must provide the Commanders in Chief (CINCs) sufficient equipment and trained person nel to conduct PR operations effectively. The CINCs must include PR in their operational planning and joint training program and ensure adequate PR-capable personnel and equipment are available to support contingency plans.  The DCS, G-3 assigned the Director, DAMO-OD with the responsibility for oversight of Service planning, preparation, and support responsibilities in  accordance with cited DoD policy and to provide Army Staff representation to the Personnel Recovery working groups.  The Army is currently staffing Army Personnel Recovery policy and an Army Repatriation Operations Plan (OPLAN) in accordance with DODD 231 0.2, DODI 2310.4, and CJCSI 3270.01A.  The scope and infinite duration of this new mission for DAMO-OD requires additional manpower to serve as the Army Staff officers for Personnel Recovery planning, coordination, information gathering, and subject matter  expertise.  This function requires very specialize, in-depth expertise for routine coordination with OSD, the Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, Services, Army MACOMs and Components. USAREUR G-3 is a key component of the ongoing initiatives from JFCOM, HQDA, the Combatant Commands and the services in developing effective Personnel Recovery experts and training individuals and units in the proper procedures.  USAREUR G-3 is the proponen t for training and equipping US Army Europe personnel to conduct PR operations effectively. 2.0  Scope.

The services offered include General Appraisal Services, Appraisal Review Services, Appraisal Consulting and Concession Valuations for customers; "	Aviation Services - Provides aviation policy and oversight for supporting all DOI aviation functions; "	Other DOI Support Services - A wide variety of services are provided including Creative Communication Services, Employee Services, Facilities Management, Property and Asset Management Services, Mandated Services, and DOI IT Support Services; and "	Information Technology (IT) Services - Premier provider of IT Services to the NBC, including Infrastructure, Integration, Disaster Recovery, Web Development, and IT Security in support of the NBC. To support these service offerings, the NBC procures, manages, operates, and, in many cases, has developed a portfolio of complex administrative and mission-oriented software applications.  These applications are supported by a heterogeneous IT environment that includes mainframe, client/server, and web architectures running on z/OS, UNIX, and Windows based platforms.   As is the case with many large enterprises, these applications and information systems have evolved independently over time and do not currently adhere to a consistent architecture.  This reduces the ability of the NBC to optimize the efficiency, effectiveness, and interoperability of its IT environment, and thus its ability to competitively support its DOI and cross agency customers. For example, a significant portion of the work that is currently performed on one of the NBC's three IBM mainframes is moving to a server technology base in 2006.  This leaves the remaining services on the mainframe with a disproportionate cost allocation, and thus reduces the NBC's capability to competitively support its customers. Competition and choice are essential to the delivery of quality service, and the NBC recognizes that it must earn its customers by providing better service than other government COEs and private sector providers.  To meet this goal, it is imperative that the NBC resolve this immediate mainframe utilization issue while developing a forward looking strategy that will optimize performance across the enterprise, and provide an overall IT architecture that is cost efficient, flexible and scalable for future growth. Request for Information The purpose of this RFI is to afford industry an opportunity to comment on best practices and critical elements that the government should incorporate in structuring an Information Technology Modernization Analysis for the NBC.  The effectiveness, efficiency, and timeliness of the Technology Modernization Analysis, will be a key contributor to the success of the NBC IT Modernization and of the NBC's ability to competitively serve its customers.  Any comments provided should not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific approach or product intended to be proposed, but as an opportunity to improve an eventual solicitation package.  Comments are solicited regarding the following. 1.	The NBC is considering a scope of work that includes developing an enterprise architecture for NBC (as-is, to-be, transition), identification and evaluation of alternatives for addressing the mainframe and overall IT environment, and a business case for the recommended alternative.  For the IT Modernization Analysis to provide a solid foundation for the modernization initiative, what are the key elements the government should ask for in terms of: a.	Scope b.	Critical success factors/performance measures (for the analysis) c.	Major tasks/steps d.	Schedule (time frames), including start up period between award and performance e.	Deliverables and their key characteristics f.	IT Modernization Analysis acquisition risks that must be managed/mitigated. 2.	The NBC is considering a negotiated firm-fixed price performance-based contract with an objective and performance measures.  Based on past experience and knowledge of Government competitive sourcing procedures: a.	Is this the best contract approach for an IT Modernization Analysis of this sort?  What are the plusses and minuses of alternative approaches? b.	What performance measures would be most effective in ensuring a successful IT Modernization Analysis?  c.	What is the size standard for the industry for this type of analysis, and whether the responding firm is below that size standard? d.	What are the best practices for commercial terms and conditions for this type of project? 3.	Selection will be made on a best-value basis.  What are the key factors the NBC should include in evaluating: a.	Approach and methodology b.	Past performance c.	Organizational experience d.	Personnel experience - what are the appropriate roles and the key qualifications for those roles? 4.	A statement of interest from all firms that respond to the RFI.  Comments, whether supportive or critical, are earnestly solicited regarding every aspect of the proposed initiative. Replies are not mandatory. Replies will be separated from, and have no bearing on, subsequent evaluations of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal Request for Proposals.  The use of comments received from industry to complete final statements of work and resulting solicitation documents will be at the discretion of the NBC. Any subsequent solicitation will be synopsized prior to its release. Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice. The Government will not critique a potential offeror's comments and the RFI should not be used by offerors to market their products/services. The Government does not intend to pay for the information solicited and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of the RFI. Proprietary information is not being solicited.  Information considered proprietary, if any, should be identified as such.

<SUBJECT>A -- Novel Technologies in Newborn Screening
<SOLNBR>NICHD-2006-01
<RESPDATE>031306
<ARCHDATE>03282006
<CONTACT>Paul  Duska, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-435-6955, Fax 301-402-3676, Email pd28n@nih.gov
<DESC>The following text is modified to replace quotation marks that the internet software converted into question marks.  The quotation marks are now replaced with single quote marks; the text is otherwise unchanged.

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to award a contract for the development of multiplexed screening assays that can be automated and utilized in a high throughput environment for newborn screening.  The intended goal of the contract is to develop a screening technology platform of components based on a range of technologies that include, but are not limited to: chip technologies, microbead technologies, nanotechnologies, microfluidics, DNA assays, biophysical assays, and technologies based on RNA or proteomics.  Offerors should propose a technology that tests for all conditions or an integrated platform of complementary technologies that can accomplish the screening of groups of conditions, which can be utilized by State Newborn Screening Programs or that can be adapted by large commercial laboratories involved in newborn screening.  The conditions to be addressed might include inborn errors of metabolism, hematological disorders, congenital endocrinopathies, lysosomal storage diseases, immunodeficiency disorders, chromosomal disorders (e.g., fragile X syndrome), or those characterized through control mechanisms of gene expression (e.g., epigenetics).  NICHD prefers that the technology platforms integrate the testing of multiple groups of conditions and link to newborn screening informatic systems.  NICHD is particularly interested in technologies that screen for 'high priority' conditions with current or promising effective therapeutic interventions (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, severe combined immunodeficiency, the lysosomal storage diseases – Pompe disease, Fabry disease, Krabbe disease and the mucopolysaccharidoses), which presently lack sensitive and specific tests.  A report, 'Newborn Screening: Toward a Uniform Screening Panel and System' (http://mchb.hrsa.gov/screening), which the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration sponsored and the American College of Medical Genetics developed, identifies some of these 'high priority' conditions.  In this solicitation, a 'high priority' condition is a condition for which the development of a screening test would make the condition amenable to newborn screening.  Proposals in responses to this solicitation should address the following issues surrounding the development of the technologies: (1) its utility for newborn screening for conditions currently screened within the United States (including its predictive value, sensitivity and specificity); (2) its efficacy of newborn screening for conditions currently screened, comparing the new technology with traditional or alternative techniques; (3) its flexibility (i.e., ability of the technology to facilitate expansion of its multiplexing capabilities to include new conditions in the future); (4) its potential for streamlining and full automation for population screening; (5) its appropriateness, based on the framework of established screening procedures; and, (6) its potential risks and benefits (e.g., ability to detect genetic variance, clinical heterogeneity, carrier status).

The required service is defined as code 541710 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about December 12, 2005 through the web site at http://FedBizOpps.gov  (FBO).  This acquisition is NOT set-aside for small businesses, i.e., all capable organizations are invited to submit proposals.  While this acquisition is being conducted using full and open competition, proposals must include maximum utilization of small business subcontracting, as appropriate.  Questions should be sent in writing to Paul J. Duska, Contracting Officer, at duskap@mail.nih.gov , or addressed to the same at NICHD, CMB, Executive Building, Suite 7A07, 6100 EXECUTIVE BLVD MSC 7510, BETHESDA MD  20892-7510  ( if sending by overnight carrier-- 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Rockville, Maryland 20852), by fax to 301-402-3676.

<SUBJECT>D -- Technologies to Support PKI on FIPS 201 PIV Smartcards
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-PKI-SmartCard
<RESPDATE>121205
<ARCHDATE>12272005
<CONTACT>Karen Riggs, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 496-6546, Fax 301 402-0642, Email kr33v@nih.gov
<DESC>Objective:

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, (DHHS), seeks information on technologies that support the installation and management of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) credentials on FIPS 201 compliant PIV Cards.  The purpose of this RFI is to:  (1) identify qualified vendors, resources, technology, and solutions that enable the registration, identity proofing, issuance and maintenance of PKI credentials and other data on PIV cards; (2) learn about product functionalities, technical architectures and system requirements; and (3) determine how these products would operate in the DHHS environment (e.g., interoperate and/or supplement existing identity management and physical access systems).  

Description of Environment:

DHHS is comprised of the Office of the Secretary and twelve semi-independent Agencies with more than 100,000 Federal employees and contractors scattered across over 1000 locations nationwide.  PIV registration, ID card issuance and physical access control (PAC) are managed locally by each Agency, utilizing a number of PAC systems (see list below), with PIV user data maintained in a number of separate databases and/or directories.

The DHHS desktop environment is primarily Microsoft Windows. Macintosh (Apple OS X) accounts for about 5% of the desktops along with a small percentage of Linux and other UNIX based desktops.  PKI support for Blackberries and other PDAs is also required.

DHHS intends to issue 3 sets of digital certificates (i.e., authentication, digital signature, key management certificates) to each PIV card.  Certificates may be issued using one or more of the following methodologies:  (1) Centralized Issuance - Certificates are downloaded and injected onto PIV card by the DHHS security officer; (2) Desktop Issuance – Certificates are downloaded and injected onto PIV card by the user at their desktop; (3) “Kiosk” Issuance – Certificates are downloaded and injected onto PIV card by the user at a centralized facility; and/or (4) Mixed Mode – Authentication certificates are downloaded and injected onto PIV card by the DHHS security officer.  The other certificates are downloaded and injected onto the PIV card by the user at their desktop.

Requirements:

The proposed solution must:

1.	Meet all FIPS 201 and Federal PKI Common Policy Certificate Issuance and Management Requirements. 
2.	Be GSA FIPS 201 certified where applicable (http://www.cio.gov/ficc/documents/GSAacquisitionHSPD12.pdf) by October 2006.
3.	Interoperate with third-party certificate authorities that are federally approved shared service providers (http://www.cio.gov/ficc/) and/or GSA ACES (http://www.gsa.gov/aces) certificate vendors. 
4.	Support the issuance of all mandatory and optional FIPS 201 digital certificates onto PIV-2 smartcards.
5.	Provide full certificate lifecycle support including certificate issuance, re-issuance (i.e., update), renewal, key recovery (for S/MIME encryption keys) and revocation. 
6.	Support the DHHS additions to the Federal Certificate Profile, as follows:   (a) Subject Distinguished Name (DN):  UID=<FASC-N Personal identifier>, C=US, o=U.S. Government, ou=HHS, ou=Agency, cn=firstname lastname <(company name for contractors or other non-HHS employees)>; (b) Subject Alternative Name:  RFC822 Name=<Primary SMTP email address>; (c) Subject Alternative Name:  pivFASC-N=<FASC-N Personal Identifier>; (d) Extended Key Usage: Microsoft Smartcard Logon; (e) Other Name: Principal Name=<User Principal Name>
7.	Support the HHS desktop environment including Microsoft Windows (required), Macintosh (required), Citrix (highly desirable), Linux (highly desirable) and other UNIX systems (highly desirable).
8.	Interface with multiple separate data sources (e.g., X.500, LDAP, Microsoft Active Directory, virtual directories, Oracle, SQL). 
9.	Interface with physical access control systems (PACS) currently in use at DHHS [i.e., Andover Continuum, MDI SAFEnet, Hirsch Velocity 2.5, Johnson Controls’ Cardkey® P2000 (Pegasys 2000), Lenel OnGuard, and AMAG]. 

The proposed solution should also support other FIPS 201 PIV business processes and/or interface with other systems used to perform these functions.  Other PIV business processes include:  Authorization (i.e., initial approval to obtain a PIV card), Registration (i.e., identity proofing, collection of fingerprint and facial biometrics, and criminal/credit background checks), Card Issuance (i.e., loading mandatory and optional PIV elements onto the PIV card) and card management (i.e., PIV card re-issuance, renewal and revocation).

<SOLNBR>SP0200-05-R-5013
<CONTACT>Shanon Krause, Contract Specialist, Phone 215-737-2443, Fax 215-737-8144, Email Shanon.Krause@dla.mil
<DESC>This synopsis has been modified to include the statement that Number Note 22 applies to this procurement.  

The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) intends to enter into a long-term Firm-Fixed Price (with Economic Price Adjustment) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract to support the worldwide demand for Johnson & Johnson Ortho-Clinical Diagnostic Cost-Per-Test (CPT) Laboratory, Chemistry, Hematology, Coagulation, Urinalysis, Microbiology, and Blood Bank diagnostic reagents. Through Market Research it has been determined that Johnson & Johnson diagnostic reagents are specifically configured to support Johnson & Johnson’s testing systems employed at the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) worldwide. No other manufacturer or distributor can provide the Johnson & Johnson diagnostic reagents to Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) customers on a CPT basis. It has been determined that there is only one known manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, who has the capability of providing Johnson & Johnson CPT reagents.

This solicitation will require Johnson & Johnson to submit a catalog detailing all of the diagnostic reagents for each MTF serviced. All prices for Laboratory, Chemistry, Hematology, Coagulation, Urinalysis, Microbiology, and Blood Bank diagnostic reagents must be developed based on the CPT pricing methodology. Under the CPT pricing methodology Johnson & Johnson provides the testing equipment to the individual MTF’s at no cost to the government. A “usage fee” to use the equipment, service and training is amortized over the reagents that are used on that equipment, which is consistent with commercial practice.  Johnson & Johnson will be asked to provide tables detailing the reagents, add-on options and any additional discounts. Johnson & Johnson will be required to supply all supporting price documentation needed to determine each customer CPT price and ECAT catalog(s) with an inclusive price for each MTF serviced. The price for all reagents may be adjusted annually for those customers who did not meet the previous years annual committed usage volume or who have a change in their product mix. All increases in catalog prices charged to each customer will be recalculated using the pricing tables (e.g. reagent, add-on and discount). A price decrease can occur any time throughout the life of the contract.  The DSCP reserves the right to add new Johnson & Johnson diagnostic CPT reagents and related sole source supplies on a post award basis in compliance with the requirements outlined in the Competition in Contracting Act.  
 CONUS catalogs will include Federal facilities located in the 48 Contiguous States and the District of Columbia, as well as Alaska and Hawaii.  Pricing for the CONUS catalogs will be FOB Destination inclusive of transportation, handling cost or any additional fees. OCONUS catalogs will include Federal facilities located outside the continental United States.  Pricing shall be inclusive of overseas packaging costs, handling costs or any additional fees but exclusive of all transportation costs. The Government’s commercial transportation carrier will be used to deliver products to OCONUS customers.  After contract award, there will be no allowance for additional cost(s) or fees for any item awarded under this procurement initiative. 
All Purchase Order, Purchase Order Confirmation and Invoice transactions under this contract are required to be electronic. The contractor is required to use ECAT to electronically receive 850- Purchase Orders, transmit 997-Functional  Acknowledgement’s, send 855-Order Confirmation’s, and transmit 810-Invoice’s for payment. There are (2) two communication options available for ECAT; Web Supplier Interface and American National Standard Institute (ANSI) X 12 EDI Standard. Johnson & Johnson must have the capability of using at least one of these eCommerce communication options. They will be required to successfully complete system testing prior to receiving an award under this solicitation.
The contract resultant from this solicitation will have a one (1) year base period with four (4) one-year unilateral option periods. This procurement has an estimated dollar value of $35,000,000.00 over the total contract period. Solicitation SP0200-05-R-5013 is expected to become available October 31, 2005 and can be found on the DLA Procurement Gateway at http://progate.daps.dla.mil/home/.

Contract  writting system problems prevented loading a complete RFP document. A word  version of the Draft RFP FA8626-05-R-2077 has been loaded to the PIXs  library below. This word version does not contain the section J  attachments which have been loaded separately to the library.

Questions on the draft RFP for Virtual  Industry Day should be e-mailed to the buyer, Theresa hay, at  Theresa.hay@wpafb.af.mil with a copy to the Program manager, Vince Lewis  at Vincent.lewis@wpafb.af.mil . Detailed questions on format and minor  issues are not the purpose of the VID. Questions that address omissions  and significant issues or areas of confusion are desired. XR-SIMAF Library  The XR-SIMAF Library is not available until 19 Oct 05 between the hours of  0900 and 1500 EST. Library appointments must be made thru the SIMAF POC,  Ms. Stiles at 937-904-7205, Margaret.stiles@wpafb.af.mil **************************************************************************** Update 4 October 2005 - Virtual Industry Day for draft RFP (imminent  release) and Buyer Name Update The XR-SIMAF draft RFP is planned for  release by 11 October 2005. A Virtual Industry Day is planned to be held  1330 EST to 1530 EST, 18 October 2005. Interested firms should review the  draft RFP, once posted, and submit written questions via e-mail to the new  buyer, Theresa Hay, Theresa.Hay@wpafb.af.mil. Submittal in advance will  ensure that questions can be answered in a timely manner during the  Industry Day.

Look for further information on this site for further  information regarding this Virtual Industry Day. Note: New buyer Theresa  Hay replaces Michelle Hendricks on all future correspondence. ************************************************************************ Update 30 Sep 2005 - Re-Send to Fed Biz Opps - Organizational Conflict of  Interest The Fed Business Opportunities site can not handle the  Description in excess of 24000 characters so the original Sources Sought  announcement of 17 May has been saved as a WORD file and loaded to the  XR-SIMAF PIXS library below as  "ORIGINAL_SOURCES_SOUGHT_ANNOUNCEMENT_17MAY05". NOTE: The CO Finding  letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted OCI clause for  XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below.  ************************************************************************  Update 29 Sep 2005 - Organizational Conflict of Interest The Contracting  Officer has found that the potential for OCI is a significant concern for  successful performance of the XR-SIMAF Capabilities Integration Services  contract(s) and therefore the OCI clause has been re-drafted to reflect  this concern. OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria will address the  OCI issue in the draft Request for Proposal (dRFP) and any resulting  contract(s). Further, in source selection the potential for OCI will be  considered in the determination of which proposal offers the best value to  the Government. The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and  the re-drafted OCI clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below. *********************************************************************** Update 16 Sep 2005 - Small Business Size Standard Update The upcoming  competition for the XR-SIMAF services acquisition will require offerors to  submit robust small business subcontracting goals for services that  involve a high level of complex skill sets. The NAICS code of 541710  remains the same however the size standard for small businesses in this  acquisition (briefed on 14 June 2005 at Industry Days) has been raised to  1,000 employees. The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000  however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500  employees. The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of  500 could overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust  subcontracting plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses  that could provide support for this acquisition and artificially reduce  subcontracting goals. Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small  business base for this acquisition and facilitate stronger small business  participation, the size standard for small businesses in this acquisition  has been raised to 1,000 employees. This determination has been  coordinated and approved by the ASC Small Business and the Small Business  Administration offices. ********************************************************************** Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release  Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed  on 8 July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at  the Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was  determined that this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business  (SB)Set-Aside. The SB strategy under consideration will require offers to  provide aggressive small business subcontracting participation in any  proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the  Acquisition Plan, we will consider up to two awards for consolidated  Function Areas A, B, C and E under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best  Value Source Selection decision). Area D may be made as a stand alone  award or combined with an A-B-C-E award. Organizational Conflict of  Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that will be addressed in a  tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be posted to PIXS in the  next two weeks. The anticipated release of the dRFP is sliding by 45 days  to late Sept 2005. Industry will have 30 days to comment on the draft RFP.  Release of the formal RFP may slide by 45 days until late November 05 with  proposals due early Jan 06. Award is contemplated late April 06. A new  attachment (Schedule_18_Aug_05.ppt) has been added showing the projected  schedule for this effort.  ********************************************************************** Update 8 July 2005: Third set of Industry Day questions and answers has  been added to the library (scroll below). Questions were received during  one on one interview sessions June 15, 2005.  ********************************************************************* Update: Second set of answers to questions and Industry Day POCs - 24 June  2005 Questions were received prior to Industry Day regarding CMMI and  current contractors working in SIMAF. A request was also received for  contact information of companies participating in Industry Days. Both have  been added to the library (scroll below). We are working on questions  received during Industry Day and anticipate posting answers by 6 July  2005.  ************************************************************* Update: Upload of Industry Day Files - 15 Jun 05 Files briefed at the 14  Jun 05 Industry Day have been uploaded to the PIXS library. ********************************************************* Update: Extension of SOC Submittal Date + Industry Day briefings - 14 Jun  05 During the Industry Day held today, it was determined that the  submittal of the Statement of Capability (SOC), originally due on Friday  June 17th will be extended to 1600 (EST) Wed June 22nd. Several Questions  were asked about the SOC and the SOC format. For clarity the following  infromation is provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple  Functions QUESTION: Because the standard business practices, company past  performance and responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR  requirements/restrictions will be the same for all functional areas, would  it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a cover letter with separate  attachments; one containing the common company data and then attachments  that address each functional area separately? ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is  providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions being proposed may be  grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a package. Common  or repeated information may be referred to from another function area SOC,  however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will  be acceptable, however. Cover Page - Firms are allowed to submit a one  page cover page that may contain business information and details like  business size and CAGE code, etc. The cover page does not count towards  the 5 pages per function. Submittal of SOC via e-mail QUESTION: Will it be  acceptable to submit the SOC via email? ANSWER: Yes, e-mail submittal is  acceptable. Please allow up to an hour for e- mail delivery incase of low  band-width at WPAFB. Submit all electronic SOC submittals to Patricia  Krabacher, patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil. The PCO will confirm receipt  of the SOC. Availability of Industry Day Briefings QUESTION: Will the 14  June 05 XR-SIMAF Industry Day briefings be made available to industry via  PIXS, or via a CD and when?

The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000  however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500  employees. The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of  500 could overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust  subcontracting plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses  that could provide support for this acquisition and artificially reduce  subcontracting goals. Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small  business base for this acquisition and facilitate stronger small business  participation, the size standard for small businesses in this acquisition  has been raised to 1,000 employees. This determination has been  coordinated and approved by the ASC Small Business and the Small Business  Administration offices. ********************************************************************** Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release  Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed  on 8 July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at  the Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was  determined that this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business  (SB)Set-Aside. The SB strategy under consideration will require offers to  provide aggressive small business subcontracting participation in any  proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the  Acquisition Plan, we will consider up to two awards for consolidated  Function Areas A, B, C and E under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best  Value Source Selection decision). Area D may be made as a stand alone  award or combined with an A-B-C-E award. Organizational Conflict of  Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that will be addressed in a  tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be posted to PIXS in the  next two weeks. The anticipated release of the dRFP is sliding by 45 days  to late Sept 2005. Industry will have 30 days to comment on the draft RFP.  Release of the formal RFP may slide by 45 days until late November 05 with  proposals due early Jan 06. Award is contemplated late April 06. A new  attachment (Schedule_18_Aug_05.ppt) has been added showing the projected  schedule for this effort.  ********************************************************************** Update 8 July 2005: Third set of Industry Day questions and answers has  been added to the library (scroll below). Questions were received during  one on one interview sessions June 15, 2005.  ********************************************************************* Update: Second set of answers to questions and Industry Day POCs - 24 June  2005 Questions were received prior to Industry Day regarding CMMI and  current contractors working in SIMAF. A request was also received for  contact information of companies participating in Industry Days. Both have  been added to the library (scroll below). We are working on questions  received during Industry Day and anticipate posting answers by 6 July  2005.  ************************************************************* Update: Upload of Industry Day Files - 15 Jun 05 Files briefed at the 14  Jun 05 Industry Day have been uploaded to the PIXS library. ********************************************************* Update: Extension of SOC Submittal Date + Industry Day briefings - 14 Jun  05 During the Industry Day held today, it was determined that the  submittal of the Statement of Capability (SOC), originally due on Friday  June 17th will be extended to 1600 (EST) Wed June 22nd. Several Questions  were asked about the SOC and the SOC format. For clarity the following  infromation is provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple  Functions QUESTION: Because the standard business practices, company past  performance and responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR  requirements/restrictions will be the same for all functional areas, would  it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a cover letter with separate  attachments; one containing the common company data and then attachments  that address each functional area separately? ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is  providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions being proposed may be  grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a package. Common  or repeated information may be referred to from another function area SOC,  however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will  be acceptable, however. Cover Page - Firms are allowed to submit a one  page cover page that may contain business information and details like  business size and CAGE code, etc. The cover page does not count towards  the 5 pages per function. Submittal of SOC via e-mail QUESTION: Will it be  acceptable to submit the SOC via email? ANSWER: Yes, e-mail submittal is  acceptable. Please allow up to an hour for e- mail delivery incase of low  band-width at WPAFB. Submit all electronic SOC submittals to Patricia  Krabacher, patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil. The PCO will confirm receipt  of the SOC. Availability of Industry Day Briefings QUESTION: Will the 14  June 05 XR-SIMAF Industry Day briefings be made available to industry via  PIXS, or via a CD and when? ANSWER: The 14 June Industry Day briefings  will be loaded to PIXS and will available for download by COB 15 Jun 05.  ******************************************************************************Update: Posting of Improved Labor-Hour Estimate -- 7 June 2005 Thefollowing sentences have been modified in the following synopsis toreflect an improved estimate of labor hours for this effort: FROM...

<CONTACT>David Paveglio, Contracts Administrator, Phone 631-344-8461, Fax 631-344-5499, Email dpavegli@bnl.gov
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation.  This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP) for an UHV probing system designed for the high accuracy positioning of four independent probing tips to establish well-defined local electrical contacts on the surface of nanostructured samples for the purpose of electrical transport measurements. At the heart of the instrument is a nanoprobing stage designed to permit coarse and fine movement of each of the probe tips in three spatial dimensions (x, y, z), which allows coarse movement of the sample in a plane (x, y), and which can also be moved as a whole (i.e., with both tips and sample) in the (x, y) plane. To monitor the tip and sample movements in real time and at the appropriate length scales (millimeters to nanometers) and thus enable controlled tip navigation, a high-resolution FE-SEM imaging system designed for and operating under true UHV conditions shall be integrated with the Nanoprobe. Combined with an electron spectrometer, the FE-SEM shall also be capable to perform local Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and high resolution scanning Auger microscopy (SAM) on samples mounted on the Nanoprobe stage. The Nanoprobe shall be operable over a wide temperature range, with focus on low temperatures to minimize thermal noise in transport measurements. At least one of the four probe tips shall be operable as a scanning probe, capable of acquiring scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images and of performing basic scanning tunneling spectroscopy.

This acquisition is planned as a “Best Value” procurement.  The utilization of this procedure is expected to provide the greatest overall benefit to BSA/BNL.  “Best Value” employs a trade off process that permits award to other than the lowest priced offeror or to the highest technically rated offeror.  The tradeoff process, associated with Best Value involves a comparative weighing of the evaluation factors and sub-factors identified in the Request for Proposals (RFP).   Specifically, the trade off process involves selecting the most advantageous offer based upon an integrated assessment of both non-cost/price factors, taken in their assigned relative importance.  

The following factors, in their relative order of weighting, will be utilized to evaluate the offers:

-  General Technical Specifications: Operating specifications for the proposed UHV Nanoprobe system utilizing the same format (Section and Sub-Section numbering) presented by the specifications contained in the solicitation.

-  Performance Risk: References, points of contact and telephone numbers for all installations of UHV Nanoprobe or similar systems for the last 3 years.  

-  Upgradeability:   Operating specifications and availability of an UHV Nanoprobe configured to accept future upgrades to include nano stenciling capabilities.  

Proposals are due January 4, 2005 by 4:00 PM, EDT, and shall be submitted to Brookhaven Science Associates, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Attention: D. Paveglio, Bldg. 355, Upton, NY 11973, by US mail

<DESC>The Maintenance & Logistics Command Pacific is seeking industry comments and potential sources for its plan to solicit a multi-ship multi-option (MSMO) Phased Maintenance (PM) type contract similar to the Phased Maintenance contracts that the U.S. Navy has implemented for its ships.  This contract would be for support of USCG 378' High Endurance cutters home ported in Alameda, CA.

The proposed contract is not simply a re-packaging of previous Coast Guard contracts for dockside and dry dock repairs into a multi-year contract.  It differs significantly from the model previously used by the Coast Guard.  Under that model, the Coast Guard developed detailed specifications, bids were taken, and award made.  Here, rather than hiring a contractor to perform work packages specified by the government, this contract seeks a single Maintenance Integrator.  It is a complete paradigm shift, moving the 378’ WHEC maintenance program in line with Best Practices pioneered and refined by the U.S. Navy during the past 20 years in its PM contracting programs, and the Best Practices of the ship repair industry.  After testing and refining these practices beginning in the late 1980’s and into the 1990’s, the U. S. Navy has largely abandoned its traditional, single ship repair contracting program in favor of these multi-ship, multi-option (MSMO) type of contracting vehicles.

This acquisition will seek a single maintenance integrator to develop, plan, manage, and execute all commercial depot level maintenance for the WHEC class in Alameda under a single contract.  The contractor will participate as a full member of MLCPAC’s Acquisition Team in reviewing maintenance needs, performing detailed ship checking, writing of the repair specification for USCG approval, development of the final work execution plan prior to the star of work, work execution.  Complete integration of maintenance management activities is crucial to the PM concept, the key to which is active involvement of the integrator into all phases of the maintenance cycle.   It is from this complete integration that MLCPAC expects to obtain the same cost savings and efficiencies and savings of critical maintenance days that have been achieved by the Navy.  By switching to the single maintenance integrator model, the Coast Guard expects to duplicate the both the reductions in maintenance costs and maintenance days that the Navy has achieved since moving to the Phased Maintenance model.

Execution of work will be either at the cutter’s home berth in Alameda, CA, or at the contractor’s commercial dry dock facility.  The Pacific Area Commander has restricted dry dock repairs to the immediate San Francisco Bay Area.  Prospective contractors would need to either possess their own USCG certified dry dock facility or have access to a USCG certified dry dock facility in the Bay Area.  At present MLCPAC is aware of only two suitable dry dock facilities within the area of restriction established by the PACAREA Commander, one operated by a small business and one by a large business.

Comments from industry regarding the proposed plan are encouraged.  In particular, MLCPAC is interested in determining how many small businesses may be interested in competing for the award, especially small businesses that would choose to compete by establishing partnerships or teaming arrangements with other businesses, small or large, or by relocating new or existing ship lifting facilities to the Bay Area.

This notice seeks only potential sources and industry comment.  Offers are not being solicited and if received will not be considered.  Based on industry comment and MLCPAC needs, the Coast Guard's requirements will be finalized and a solicitation may be issued at a future date.  The preferred method for submission of comments and information is via attachment to email to the addressees listed below.  To be considered, input must be received not later than close of business on Thursday, December 8, 2005.

The purpose of this RFI is to:  (1) identify qualified vendors, resources, technology, and solutions that enable the registration, identity proofing, issuance and maintenance of PKI credentials and other data on PIV cards; (2) learn about product functionalities, technical architectures and system requirements; and (3) determine how these products would operate in the DHHS environment (e.g., interoperate and/or supplement existing identity management and physical access systems).  

Description of Environment:

DHHS is comprised of the Office of the Secretary and twelve semi-independent Agencies with more than 100,000 Federal employees and contractors scattered across over 1000 locations nationwide.  PIV registration, ID card issuance and physical access control (PAC) are managed locally by each Agency, utilizing a number of PAC systems (see list below), with PIV user data maintained in a number of separate databases and/or directories.

The DHHS desktop environment is primarily Microsoft Windows. Macintosh (Apple OS X) accounts for about 5% of the desktops along with a small percentage of Linux and other UNIX based desktops.  PKI support for Blackberries and other PDAs is also required.

DHHS intends to issue 3 sets of digital certificates (i.e., authentication, digital signature, key management certificates) to each PIV card.  Certificates may be issued using one or more of the following methodologies:  (1) Centralized Issuance - Certificates are downloaded and injected onto PIV card by the DHHS security officer; (2) Desktop Issuance – Certificates are downloaded and injected onto PIV card by the user at their desktop; (3) “Kiosk” Issuance – Certificates are downloaded and injected onto PIV card by the user at a centralized facility; and/or (4) Mixed Mode – Authentication certificates are downloaded and injected onto PIV card by the DHHS security officer.  The other certificates are downloaded and injected onto the PIV card by the user at their desktop.

Requirements:

The proposed solution must:

1.	Meet all FIPS 201 and Federal PKI Common Policy Certificate Issuance and Management Requirements. 
2.	Be GSA FIPS 201 certified where applicable (http://www.cio.gov/ficc/documents/GSAacquisitionHSPD12.pdf) by October 2006.
3.	Interoperate with third-party certificate authorities that are federally approved shared service providers (http://www.cio.gov/ficc/) and/or GSA ACES (http://www.gsa.gov/aces) certificate vendors. 
4.	Support the issuance of all mandatory and optional FIPS 201 digital certificates onto PIV-2 smartcards.
5.	Provide full certificate lifecycle support including certificate issuance, re-issuance (i.e., update), renewal, key recovery (for S/MIME encryption keys) and revocation. 
6.	Support the DHHS additions to the Federal Certificate Profile, as follows:   (a) Subject Distinguished Name (DN):  UID=<FASC-N Personal identifier>, C=US, o=U.S. Government, ou=HHS, ou=Agency, cn=firstname lastname <(company name for contractors or other non-HHS employees)>; (b) Subject Alternative Name:  RFC822 Name=<Primary SMTP email address>; (c) Subject Alternative Name:  pivFASC-N=<FASC-N Personal Identifier>; (d) Extended Key Usage: Microsoft Smartcard Logon; (e) Other Name: Principal Name=<User Principal Name>
7.	Support the HHS desktop environment including Microsoft Windows (required), Macintosh (required), Citrix (highly desirable), Linux (highly desirable) and other UNIX systems (highly desirable).
8.	Interface with multiple separate data sources (e.g., X.500, LDAP, Microsoft Active Directory, virtual directories, Oracle, SQL). 
9.	Interface with physical access control systems (PACS) currently in use at DHHS [i.e., Andover Continuum, MDI SAFEnet, Hirsch Velocity 2.5, Johnson Controls’ Cardkey® P2000 (Pegasys 2000), Lenel OnGuard, and AMAG]. 

The proposed solution should also support other FIPS 201 PIV business processes and/or interface with other systems used to perform these functions.  Other PIV business processes include:  Authorization (i.e., initial approval to obtain a PIV card), Registration (i.e., identity proofing, collection of fingerprint and facial biometrics, and criminal/credit background checks), Card Issuance (i.e., loading mandatory and optional PIV elements onto the PIV card) and card management (i.e., PIV card re-issuance, renewal and revocation).

<DESC>CONTACT Andrew Lennane, Electronics Engineer, (732) 532-1541.  This is a sources sought notice to determine interested and capable sources for participation in an intended competitive source selection for Full Spectrum Electronic Counter Measure (ECM ) Antenna.   Interested parties must be capable of designing and producing a wide band antenna to be used for Electronic Warfare (EW) purposes.  The antenna must be fieldable, have a single and dual cable output, and operate over a wide frequency spectrum.    In addition, it should maximize effectiveness through efficiencies and special radiation techniques.  The antenna, while providing immediate and urgent coverage for US Coalition Force efforts in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freed om (OIF), must also increase ECM system effectiveness, withstand a harsh warfighter environment, utilize conventional mounting locations and be simple to install.  It is expected that the antenna will be deployed on tactical wheeled and tracked vehicles in  addition to fixed site usage.  The antenna will operate from 25 MHz to 6000 MHz with a gain of at least -7dBi from 25 MHz to 100 MHz and a gain of -3 dBi from 100 MHz to 6000 MHz.  The antenna shall have an omni-directional azimuth pattern and have a down ward pointing elevation pattern.  The Voltage Standing Wave Ration (VSWR) will be less than 3:1 below 100 MHz and less than 2:1 above 100 MHz and handle 100 W of power.  The vendor will be required to deliver 20 foot armored Radio Frequency (RF) cables wit h the antenna.  Antenna survivability is of utmost importance.  The antenna must meet all Mil-Std-810F as well as be able to withstand an impact with a 6x 6 oak beam while traveling at 25 MPH.  It is anticipated that sample hardware antenna units will be  required as part of proposal submissions.  The Government intends to award one or more five-year Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract(s) for a total of 38,450 antennas as a result of the source selection. Product ion quantities are subject to change.   It is expected that First Article Testing and First Unit Equipped (FUE) will be complete 120 days after contract award (DAC), with a minimum production rate of 1,600 units/month achieved by 150 DAC and a maximum prod uction rate of 2,400 units/month achieved by 300 DAC. Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The response should be a BRIEF UNCLASSIFIED description of technical and production capabilities that can meet the above needs and should address surge capabilit y as well. Responses from interested sources shall address their capability to act as one of two potential providers for the aggregate quantities of antennas and identify themselves as a small or large business based on the NAICS code 334220.  Submit one e lectronic copy of the submission to Andrew Lennane, Electronics Engineer, at Andrew.lennane@mail1.monmouth.army.mil.  The deadline for the receipt of responses to this sources sought notice is 09 December 2005.  This is not a Request For Proposals.  Do not  submit proposals in response to this Sources Sought announcement.

<SUBJECT>R -- Management Support Services
<DESC>The Office of the Chief People Officer proposes to procure an effort for Human Resource Performance Measurement without using full and open competition. This requirement is being issued by the GSA Office of the Chief Acquisition Officer’s Operational Contracting Staff (VC) in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  Due to limitations in GSA’s existing performance measurement process and methods, the Chief People Officer has decided to revise OCPO’s processes to obtain better cost-effective decision-making information.  Accurate, transaction-level measurements will enhance GSA’s insight into their workforce.  These measures are needed to benchmark the performance and progress of OCPO’s most valuable and most expensive asset, its human capital, in order to improve strategic and financial planning and to drive organizational improvements which are the ultimate objectives for this process. OCPO has determined that to reach these objectives, it needs metrics that: (1) focus specifically on human capital; (2) can be integrated with financial measures, and (3) are available in real time to reflect the changes in our resources as they occur.  In addition, GSA needs to place their results in context by benchmarking them against similar-sized organizations.  The resulting customized reports and analysis are essential for making the best use of GSA’s human capital during the challenges facing the agency. The period of performance of the base period for this effort shall not exceed 12 months from the date of award. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with CLC Metrics, Inc. for the supplies and services in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.

<SUBJECT>A -- Materials for Optimally Responsive Fabricated Structures (MORFS)
<DESC>The Office of the Secretary of Defense through the Air Force Research Laboratory, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Non-Metallic Division, Structural Materials Branch (AFRL/MLBC) is seeking information on structural material composite technologies capable of large changes in shape and/or mechanical properties. The structural properties must be sufficiently robust to withstand mechanical and thermal loads of traditional air and space applications in one operational state, but also able to be repeatedly modulate or deformed without over taxing the power system of the weapons platform or degrading the structure. The information provided through the responses is expected to be used to draft a Request for Proposals (RFP) planned for released in early 2006 on the topic of Materials for Optimally Responsive Fabricated Structures (MORFS).

The Government is interested in obtaining information from industry to identify the current state-of-the-art and advancements (potential and under development) for “morphing”, “adaptive”, “symbiotic”, “responsive”, or “situationally aware” structural materials technologies that have potential application in current and future air and space applications including “morphing” air vehicles, deformable space structures, and possibly airbase infrastructure. The primary attribute of the envisioned material system is the ability to change shape or mechanical properties of a structural composite in order to facilitate multi-mission needs within a given thermal environment. This implies that the materials technology would have previously been shown to have sufficient mechanical and thermal promise to be useful in current applications. Material systems that can also adapt their thermal, electrical, or optical properties are considered to be important in constructing multifunctional composites and will enable numerous applications. However, these should be considered secondarily to the structural modulation. The envisioned technology could use many of the integration and processing methods of traditional fiber reinforced polymeric matrix composites to meet both primary and secondary attributes, but should definitely be sufficiently novel from past work (piezo patches, large hinges, etc.) to warrant investigation as a material system. It is not directly implied that the material system is required to be the source of activation or actuation. 

Responders to this request for information, should describe (1) the relevant technology and underlying mechanisms, (2) current and expected performance in terms of amount of structural change, energy requirements, speed of activation, (3) technology maturity status (commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), qualification unit, breadboard, technology readiness level (TRL), manufacturing readiness level (MRL), etc.), (4) key technical or logistical challenges in inserting technology into current systems; and (5) expected impact applications (i.e. subsonic aeroelastic tailoring, deformation of space optics, etc.).  

Respondents should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.  Formal responses should be e-mailed (preferred), faxed or mailed to:

Phone: (937) 255-5402
FAX:  (937) 255-5302

Technical questions regarding this RFI should be directed to Dr. Jeffery Baur, AFRL/MLBC, (937) 255-9143.

Responses are requested NO LATER THAN 22 Dec 2005.  Given the need for a rapid response to this RFI, lengthy and elaborate presentation material and explanations are optional.  Marketing materials are not a sufficient response to this RFI.  Please limit responses to no more than 10 pages.  Information requested under Note 25 does not count towards the 10 pages.  Submissions shall be in font equivalent to a standard 10-pitch type or larger.  Examples of standard 10 POINT business fonts which are equivalent to 10 pitch are Arial, Bookman, or Roman.  Pages shall be double-spaced, single-sided, 8.5 by 11 inches.  This limitation includes all information, e.g., indices, photographs, foldouts, appendices, attachments, etc.  The government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation.  Submittals via e-mail are preferred.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In addition, a security clearance will be required.

<SUBJECT>--Joint Data Analysis Centr (JDAC) Sole Source Acquisition
<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with CAS, Inc.., of Huntsville, Alabama for continued operation and maintenance of the Joint Data Analysis Center (JDAC), Huntsville, AL.  The propo sed acquisition is directed to CAS, Inc.., pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).  The selection of CAS, Inc. is based on the prior work performed by CAS, Inc., including requirements identification, preliminary design,  and implementation of the hardware and software operating within the JDAC.  This effort was completed via a task order under a competitively-awarded contract.  CAS, Inc. has developed an extensive knowledge base through a steep learning curve, and extensi ve interactions with the JDAC and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) during the on-going ramp up.  Any source other than CAS, Inc. would result in substantial increase in schedule risk as well as duplication of cost to the Government that cannot be recovered thr ough competition.  It is highly improbable that other sources are available to duplicate the work already accomplished by the incumbent, to meet the Government's compressed schedule requirements and not disrupt current operations.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee, L evel of Effort type contract vehicle is contemplated.  The anticipated period of performance will consist of a six (6)-month base period with two (2) three (3)-month options.  This is only a bridge contract vehicle to allow the Government ample time to pre pare for and execute a competitive acquisition for overall operation and maintenance of the JDAC. The services required to meet the needs of the JDAC include the continuation of the design activities which will proceed into integration and system test activities adhering to both system engineering and security requirements as directed by the government .  The contractor will complete the development of, and stand up, the JDAC.  Development activities will include systems engineering, configuration management, security engineering, test and evaluation, certification and accreditation.   This action is not open to allied participation.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested p ersons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to sol icit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This notice of intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties are advised that the JDAC is currently undergoing development a nd that system documentation is not currently available.  Interested parties who believe they can perform this requirement without substantial duplication of cost to the Government are invited to submit a written narrative statement of capability, includin g detailed technical information sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine bona fide capability to meet the Governments requirements.  In order to be considered responsive, the statement must demonstrate (1) a history of proven experience  in developing, operating, maintaining, and modifying a Government data analysis center; (2) the ability to immediately assume the on-going project without disruption to current operations, and (3) have a high probability of meeting the Government's compre ssed schedule.  Submittals (responses) to this notice that do not include the required documentation will be considered non-responsive.  The above stated information must be received no later than 15 days after publication of this synopsis, should cite JDA C Sole Source Acquisition, and should be emailed to Astrid Lahiere at astr id.lahiere@smdc.army.mil.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of det ermining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered.  This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation.  Telephone or facsimile inquires and/or responses will not be accepted.

1. Purpose of this PBSO: 
The objective and scope of this effort is to provide DCMA with Scriptlogic software licenses and the training required tofamiliarize our Directory Administrators with Scriptlogic Administrator Toolkit software. 
2.  Background Information About DCMA:
DCMA is the Department of Defense agency responsible for working with the Defense industry to help ensure that systems, supplies, and services are delivered on time, at projected costs, and meet performance requirements.  This involves managing 320,000 prime contracts with current work valued at $850 billion.  
DCMA is headquartered in Fairfax County, Virginia (with a mailing address of Alexandria, VA), and employs over 11,000 civilian and military professionals worldwide.   The agency is organized into three Districts: East, headquartered in Boston, MA; West, headquartered in Carson, CA; and International, which is co-located with the agency headquarters.  The districts are further subdivided into 60 Contract Management Offices (CMOs) that work with Defense industry SPs at over 900 locations worldwide.

6. Performance Expectations and Standards:
Deliver quality support services on time
•	Provide all deliverables on time.
•	90% of survey takers respond with a “Satisfied or Very Satisfied when asked “Did this course meet your expectations?”
7. Periodic Adjustments of Performance Standards:
In its experience with other performance-based instruments, DCMA has found it not only advisable but necessary to adjust performance standards periodically.  That is because particular written expressions of performance standards sometime inadvertently motivate services provider behaviors that act against achievement of the desired performance objectives.  Having learned that lesson, DCMA intends to apply it to this PBSO.  Accordingly, DCMA reserves the right to adjust any or all performance standards in this PBSO, up to and including the addition of entirely new performance standards and complete substitutions of new performance standards for those already existing in this PBSO or as may have been included by subsequent modifications of this document, at any time at the DCMA Information Technology Customer Service Organization’s (ITCSO’s) discretion—subject, of course, to the stipulations in the “Changes” clause of any resulting contract.  DCMA, however, does not plan to make any such adjustments more often than once each calendar quarter and in fact would prefer not to make them any more frequently than once each calendar year.       
8.  Period of Performance:
The period of performance is 12 months from contract award.
9. Travel:  
Travel expenses will not be reimbursed by the government. 
10.  Invoicing Information: 
SPs shall submit invoices electronically via DoD’s Wide Area Workflow system.  The POC for WAWF is Ms. Alicia Allen 703 428-0887. (https://wawf.eb.mil/).

A plate or other sealing stiff protective material shall be installed in place of  the governor components to protect internal components of the engine.  The standard commercial warranty applies to this procurement, and the warranty period shall be a minimum of one year.

Ans: There are currently 4 systems attached to the CX200; 3 of which are Windows-based. The other is the VMware ESX Host, which will not require PowerPath. The other three hosts are already licensed for PowerPath.
2. What array based software is currently installed on the cx200
Ans: Navisphere
3 - This is an upgrade from a CX200 to CX500.  Will there be any equipment reused from the CX200, or will all the equipment be new?
Ans:  All disks and corresponding shelves will be re-used.
4 - Will there be any data migration from the CX200 to the new CX500? 
Ans: Since the disks (and corresponding shelves) will be re-used, no migration services should be required

5 - The equipment will fit in a 24U rack.  Should we spec a 24U rack or the larger 42U rack? 
Ans: The CX200 is already in an EMC-branded enclosure. It will be re-used.

6 - Please confirm that this is quantity 1. 
Ans: The upgrade is for replacing one CX200 (in Virginia) to a CX500.

7 - How many hosts (servers) will be connecting to this CX500?  Do we need to quote HBA (host bus adaptor) cards for these hosts?  Do you want 2 HBAs per server for redundancy?  Is installation of these servers required?
Ans: There will be less than 7 hosts connected. All hosts that are connecting already have redundant HBA's and plug into redundant switches.
8 - Dell recommends redundant FC switches for fault tolerance and to eliminate a single point of failure.  Is this required?
Ans: See answer on Question 7.
9 - Dell recommends redundant power supplies on the CX500.  Is this required? 
Ans: Yes, all components should be redundant.
10 - Is training required for DCMA personnel for SAN operation? 
Ans: No
11 - Are UPS (uninterruptable power supplies) required? 
Ans: Already installed in cabinet
12 - Dell recommends 3 year support.  Is this correct? 
Ans: Since this is an unexpected (but very necessary) upgrade for a device that will be coming up for replacement in the next fiscal year, the existing warranty will be fine.
13 - Disks must be at least 146GB 10K FC drives.  Can we supply 300GB 10K FC drives? 
Ans: All existing drives are 146GB.
