<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Research Triangle Park, NC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with BMG Labtech, Inc., Cary, NC 27513, pursuant to 41 U.S.C.3304(a)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This purchase is for one (1) each of the following: #0430-101 Clariostar Reader, #1000-501 Control and Evaluation Software, #1000-502 Installation and Training, #1100-430-110 Bottom Reading, #1100-430-120 Absorbance-Spectrometer, #1100-430-130 Luminescence, #1100-430-150 High Performance TRF/HTRF, #1100-900 Atmospheric Control Unit, and #1200-680-101 LVis Plate. The system will be used to generate assay data with a variety of luminescence, fluorescence, absorbance (UV-Vis) and TR-FRET endpoints from various types of multi-well plates (e.g., 96-well, 384-well). The system is a highly sensitive system (to detect small signals of &lsquo;early' response) with a large dynamic range (to minimize cost) and flexibility to measure a variety of assay endpoints. The system must support measurement kinetics data with injection capabilities, read low volumes (a few &micro;L) to reduce cost and maximize data generation, and the capability to assay endpoints over multiple-day exposure scenarios under controlled temperature and CO2 supporting cell cultures. Additional system requirements: 8 amol sensitivity for detection of luminescence (~30X more sensitive than closest competitor), dynamic range of a full order of magnitude larger than all other luminescent readers); 10 amol sensitivity for detection of fluorescence (18X more sensitive than closest competitor); Can assay very small volumes (a few &micro;L) where sample volumes s are limited, optimized to read 3 wavelengths simultaneously (230, 260, 28 nm) which is ideal DNA/RNA quantification; Ability to control CO2 and temperature levels for longer-term cell based assays; Uses linear excitation and emission with adjustable bandwidths from 8-100 nm which eliminates the need for filter purchases/changes and provides flexibility to adapt to new assays; Rapid scanning UV-Vis (220nm-1000nm, 1s/well) and 50Hz reads for high resolution kinetics; Ability for Top and bottom reading depending on the assay system used; and Accommodates 2 internal injectors to assay 3-350&micro;L volumes. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within 9 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within 9 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, the order will be issued to BMG Labtech. NAICS Code/Size is 334516/500 Employees. Award is subject to approval of Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition. Award is also subject to availability of funds. This procurement is to be processed using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures in conjunction with FAR Part 12 Commercial Item Acquisition of Commercial Items. There is no solicitation package available. For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Dee Lunney via email lunney@niehs.nih.gov

Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 611310 - Academies, College or University and the associated small business size standard of $25.5M.</p>
<p>Background Information:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has a long-standing interest in psychotropic medication prescribing patterns in the outpatient mental healthcare setting. Analyses performed to date have been limited to data from single states, individual payers, or specific treatment settings as well as surveys with small numbers of treated individuals. Investigators at Columbia University and Yale have a license with Intercontinental Marketing Services (IMS) Health-LifeLink<sup>TM</sup> for access to the proprietary LRx Longitudinal Prescription 2006-2009 databases for prescriptions from 33,000 retailers (approximately 75% of all retail pharmacies in the US). These databases contain de-identified individual prescriptions that are nationally representative with respect to patient sex, age, and insurance coverage. It is from these databases that the Contractor shall perform a set of analyses.</p>
<p><br />Purpose of the Requirement:<br />The Contractor shall provide panalyses on prescription patterns in the United States of antipsychotic medications in children ranging from one (1) to seventeen (17) years of age; stimulant medications in individuals ranging from one (1) to eighty (80) years of age; and of antipsychotic medications in adults ranging from fifty (50) to eighty (80) years of age.<br /> <br />Contractor Requirements:<br />The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>1)	Work with available population-based administrative data from source described in the &lsquo;Background Information' section of this Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS) on psychotropic prescription drug claims, including data on antipsychotic medications and stimulant medications. Prescription-level data shall be indexable at the patient level and at the prescriber level. Data shall cover at least, but not limited to, calendar years 2006 to 2009 in the United States. The data shall be representative of the corresponding US population; and the database(s) shall be sufficiently large to support rigorous statistical analyses for both males and females and across relevant age ranges (e.g., children, adolescents, older adults). &lsquo;Rigorous' is defined as sufficiently large to have at least 80% power for detecting differences in prescription drug use of 0.5 percentage points or smaller between population cells defined by sex and single year of age.</p>
<p>a.	Conduct specific empirical analyses of the prevalence and correlates of psychotropic drug use, by demographic status and across time, as described in further detail in Tasks, listed below.</p>
<p>Task 1 - Analysis of Antipsychotic Treatment of Children in the United States The Contractor shall compare antipsychotic use in the United States in recent years, across three (3) age groups - young children (one (1) to six (6) years), children (seven (7) to twelve (12) years), and adolescents (thirteen (13)to seventeen (17) years). The Contractor shall assess the percentage of each age group who received any antipsychotic medication during the course of one year. Rates of antipsychotic use shall be examined separately for males and females and described with respect to duration and dosage of antipsychotic treatment, other co-prescribed classes of psychotropic medications, and in terms of which type of physician (i.e., psychiatrists vs. others) who prescribed the medications. For those patients filling antipsychotic medications for whom service claims data are available, the three age groups shall be further characterized with respect to ten (10) different categories of mental disorders:</p>
<p>1)      Schizophrenia and other psychoses<br />2)	Pervasive developmental disorders or mental retardation<br />3)	Bipolar disorder<br />4)	Disruptive behavior disorders<br />5)	Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder<br />6)	Depression or mood disorder, not otherwise specified<br />7)	Anxiety disorders<br />8)	Adjustment disorder<br />9)	Communication and learning disorders<br />10)	Other mental disorders</p>
<p>The results shall provide the first national portrait of antipsychotic use by young children, children, and adolescents in the United States. New insights will be generated concerning how the use of antipsychotic medications changes throughout childhood and adolescence in the United States.</p>
<p>Task 2 - National Patterns in Stimulant Treatment<br />The Contractor shall examine the use of stimulant medications - which are principally used to treat attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - across the life cycle in the United States. The Contractor shall compare the rate and pattern of stimulant use in young children (one (1) to six (6) years), children (seven (7) to twelve (12) years), adolescents (thirteen (13) to seventeen (17) years), young adults (eighteen (18) to twenty-nine (29) years), adults twenty(20) to forty-nine (49) years), and older adults (fifty (50) to eighty (80) years). The six (6) age groups shall be compared with respect to the rate of stimulant use overall and by gender and prescribing physician specialty. Among individuals who are prescribed stimulants, the age groups shall be compared with respect to the total duration of stimulant treatment during the study year. To characterize  the duration of stimulant treatment episodes, a related analysis shall examine continuity of stimulant treatment among patients who initiate stimulants during  the first quarter of the study year. To evaluate the complexity of their pharmacological treatment, the Contractor shall also examine the proportion of stimulant treated patients in each age group who receive antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and mood stabilizers during the course of the study year. Among the subset of individuals with available service claims data, the Contractor shall compare the six stimulant-treated groups with respect to the proportion who received a diagnosis for ADHD, narcolepsy, depression, cognitive impairment, and obesity. The results shall describe stimulant prescribing practices across the lifespan and help to identify patient groups at risk for suboptimal stimulant treatment.</p>
<p>Task 3 - Antipsychotic Treatment of Older Adults in the United States<br />The Contractor shall examine patterns of antipsychotic treatment among older adults in the United States. The Contractor will compare the rates at which adts aged fifty-one (51) to sixty (60), sixty-one (61) to seventy (70), and seventy-one (71) to eighty (80) years of age receive any antipsychotic medications during the study year, and antipsychotic treatment rates among males and females within these three (3) age groups. Among adults treated with antipsychotic medications, the Contractor shall compare the three age groups with respect to the mean number of days of antipsychotic medication treatment during the study year, mean chlorpromazine equivalents prescribes during days of treatment, total antipsychotic exposure during the study year, and treatment with individual antipsychotic medications. Among those antipsychotic-treated patients for whom service claims data are available, the Contractor shall compare the three age groups with respect to the percentage who receive a diagnosis of dementia, depression, anxiety, delirium, bipolar, and schizophrenia or related psychoses. The Contractor shall also determine the proportion of patients whose antipsychotic medications are prescribed by psychiatrists as compared with non- psychiatrist physicians focusing on provider specialty differences in medication selection, dose, duration of treatment, and treated conditions. The results shall offer new insights into national antipsychotic medication treatment of older adults.</p>
<p>Contractor Experience Requirements:<br />The contractor must have documented an verifiable experience performing the requirements outlined in 'Contract Requirements', a Medical Doctorate (M.D.), a graduate degree in epidemiology or public health, and a board certified psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Capability Statement:<br />Contractors that believe they possess the ability to provide the required services should submit documentation of their ability to meet the project requirements to the Contract Specialist.  Contractors should also provide their Company Name, DUNS number, Physical Address, and Point of Contact Information. <br />Interested organizations are required to identify their type of business, applicable North American Industry Classification Code, and size standards in accordance with the Small Business Administration.  The government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in a response to this notice.  However, responses that indicate the information therein is proprietary will be properly safeguarded for Government use only.  Capability statements must include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives.  Capability statements in response to this market survey that do not provide sufficient information for evaluation will be considered non responsive.  When submitting this information, please reference the solicitation notice number. <br />All capability statements sent in response to this Sources Sought Notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Paul Marsalese, Contract Specialist , at Paul.Marsalese@nih.gov in MS Word format within 7 calendar days of the date of this announcement.

The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.

<DESC>&nbsp;Response to Questions Submitted:&nbsp;
<p>1. On drawing 8555004, the fabrication tolerance of +/- .01 will be difficult to maintain on the upright tube center to center dimensions of 50.00" and 24.00". This will require post machining to the tube IDs.&nbsp; Question: Can these tolerances be increased to +/- .06?<br /><br />The tolerances were updated previous to the question and are on the revised 8555004 drawing (see attached drawing rev).&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. On drawing 8555004, Item 7 and Item 8 gusset plate weld symbols cannot be achieved. Item 7: the web of the channel is only 0.15" so a corner to corner joint will only have 0.15" land for a fillet weld. Item 7 and Item 8: cannot be all around because only three sides have a joint (3 sides contacting the channel). Recommend 0.25 fillet on arrow side and other side on 3 sides of the plates, 4 locations.&nbsp; Question: Can the weld symbols reflect above?</p>
<p>The <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>AWS 2.4 specification indicates that the all-around symbol is not strictly correct in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The drawing will be revised to identify three separate welds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The fillet weld size is not recommended to be greater than the thinnest member per AWS D1.2 (e.g. the case of the .150" web).</p>
