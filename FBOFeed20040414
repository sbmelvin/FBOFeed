<DESC>The U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) intends to negotiate a non-competitive contract modification with Harris Corporation, Broadcast Communications Division, 3200 Wismann Lane, P.O. Box 4290, Quincy, 1L 62305 for the fabrication and shipping of a PAL/B VHF Television (TV) broadcasting system and ancillary equipment for installation at Mosul, Iraq.  It is expected that a 2kW to 5 kilowatt, Channel 12 system will be ordered.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition that is applicable to this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2), Unusual and Compelling Urgency.  Harris Corporation was awarded a letter contract that was definitized in February 2004 to provide a 5kW PAL/B VHF television system for Baghdad.  This contract was as the result of a BBG "Sources Sought" Notice published at the U.S. General Services Administration’s (GSA) Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) for Vendors Internet website on November 14, 2003 and a notice of sole source award on December 17, 2003.  The first FBO Notice informed interested sources of the BBG's mandatory technical capabilities and experience requirements that such sources must meet to qualify for providing the BBG's TV broadcasting system work in Iraq including major equipment fabrication, shipping and installation work, including the urgent and compelling capability of being able to fabricate and ship the major equipment for an interim BBG TV broadcasting system in Baghdad, Iraq.  Under its contract, Harris Corporation completed all of its initial contract delivery requirements by the contract delivery date.  The 5kW PAL/B VHF Channel 12 system will be operational in Baghdad soon.  BBG now has a follow-up requirement for another PAL/B Channel 12 television system to be installed at the Iraqi Media Network site in Mosul, Iraq.  Based on the review and validation of Harris Corporation's capabilities and experience in TV broadcasting systems engineering and major equipment fabrication and shipping, as documented in Harris Corporation's Capabilities Statement that was submitted to the BBG in response to its market survey; and Harris Corporation’s performance on the contract to date, the BBG has determined that Harris Corporation continues to be responsive to the BBG's requirements for major equipment fabrication and shipping of PAL, VHF and/or UHF, TV broadcasting systems in Iraq.  Therefore, the BBG intends to modify its existing contract with Harris Corporation to fabricate and supply television transmitter(s) and other television broadcasting equipment, including but not limited to television antenna(s), transmission line(s), and power regulation equipment, and to export pack and provide for the shipping of the above-stated TV broadcasting systems and equipment by NLT June 30, 2004 to BBG designated location(s) for a requirement of an additional complete BBG TV broadcasting system that will be installed in Mosul, Iraq.  The TV system to be procured by the BBG may be installed along with other Harris PAL/B VHF TV transmitters by Harris Corporation personnel under separate contract at the Harris Corporation managed Iraqi Media Network Television broadcast site.  It is particularly noteworthy that the urgent establishment of BBG TV broadcasting systems in Iraq is a top U.S. Government priority that specifically includes the BBG's launch and operation of the first TV broadcasting system in Baghdad, Iraq and subsequently up to four additional broadcast systems in other Iraqi cities.  Not achieving this Baghdad TV broadcasting system operating date would result in the BBG's not meeting the U.S. Congress' compelling mandate for the timely establishment of BBG TV broadcasting systems that will provide television programming to the Iraqi people in key cities, pursuant to authorization and appropriation of FY-2004 funding for this specific purpose.  This Public Notice of the BBG's intent to non-competitively contract with Harris Corporation is not a solicitation (Request for Proposals).  Other firms that are interested in the BBG’s requirements for major equipment fabrication and shipping of TV broadcasting systems in Iraq may respond to this Public Notice by stating their interest, capabilities, and pertinent experience to meet the BBG's TV broadcasting systems requirements cited in the notice as well as the continued requirement for a presence in Iraq that specifically includes the June 30, 2004 Mosul TV broadcasting system delivery deadline.  The responses of interested firms shall include:

(1) evidence of specific examples of the respondent’s successful past performance with a minimum of five (5) years experience in the fabrication, shipping, installation, testing, commissioning, and sustained operation and maintenance of television broadcast systems; (2) evidence of the respondent’s current on-going operations in Iraq, the starting and ending dates, and an unclassified description of such current ongoing operations in Iraq;  (3) specific examples of the respondent’s self-sustaining capabilities in Iraq;  (4) data sheets, brochures or other documentation clearly describing the proposed VHF and UHF television broadcast system equipment sized for medium to large urban environments;  and (5) a sample project plan, including but not limited to a project schedule, bill of materials, description of activities, and budgetary cost to deliver a television broadcasting system by June 30, 2004.  

The BBG must receive all such "Capabilities Statements" by 2:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), April 29, 2004.  The BBG's determination not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this Public Notice, is solely within the discretion of the BBG.  Any "Capabilities Statements" and/or other information received by the BBG from interested firms responding to this Public Notice will be considered by the BBG solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any questions regarding this Public Notice shall be submitted via facsimile to Brent Peavler, Office of Contracts (M/CON/CR), at (202) 260-0855.  Written responses to this Public Notice shall also be facsimiled to Brent Peavler at (202) 260-0855.  Telephone responses of a firm's statements of interest, capabilities, and pertinent experience will not be accepted by the BBG.  This Public Notice is not a RFP, IFB, or RFQ.

<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics intends to enter into a sole source contract under Simplified Acquisition Procedures with Judith  Banister, Citicham Place,  Building 16 Suite 21-A,  Madian, Haidian District, Beijing 100088, China for Hourly Compensation Costs for Manufacturing Workers in China. Survey will be conducted in China.  Total cost for this requirement will not exceed $28,000.  
This notice of intent is not a request for offers.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement is solely within the discretion of the Government. There is no RFP notice.  For information purposes only.

DESCRIPTION

I.  Background

The Division of Foreign Labor Statistics (DFLS) of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes international comparisons of hourly compensation costs for production workers in manufacturing for 30 countries, including several developing countries such as Mexico, Brazil, and Singapore.   These comparisons are widely used as indicators of the competitiveness of the United States in international trade.  There is a high and increasing demand for such comparisons for China.  The Advisory Councils to BLS frequently ask DFLS to initiate studies for China, even if they will only yield data for a partial comparison – such as a major city or region of the country.  We have received similar requests from other agencies in the Department of Labor and the Federal Government as well as from researchers, businesses, unions, and academics.   We are unable to meet this demand because the Chinese data are difficult for us to obtain and understand (they are mainly in Chinese and include only limited English translations),, and we do not have contacts in the Chinese National Statistical Office.  Further, there are unique aspects of China’s economic data that require expert interpretation by someone very familiar with the country’s statistics.

Our preliminary investigation has determined that data on manufacturing wages exist for China.  They are published in China’s English language yearbooks.  For the purposes of assessing comparability of the data with U.S. statistics, however, the publications do not provide sufficient information about methodologies and definitions. .  We have located other studies that attempt to measure labor costs in China in certain sectors of the economy.  These sources indicate that there are enough data and information available to justify the proposed study.

The goal of this study is to improve knowledge of the available data.  Available data at the national level shall first be investigated.  Then the project shall focus on categories of data for which more information is available such as:  data covering a particular area of the country and a subset of all manufacturing workers.  Data for 1990-2003 or the latest available is targeted.  Further, it may not be possible to include all components of hourly compensation costs:  some of these components may be unavailable or inapplicable to China.   Even though a full comparison is probably not possible at this stage, it would be a significant contribution to provide a well documented partial data set for China.

II.  Scope and Nature of Project

The contractor shall research the publicly available data for China on employment, wages, and components of additional labor costs for the manufacturing sector.   National level data shall first be investigated.

The contractor shall review the available data to determine whether the study should proceed to cover the entire country or only a selected industrial region of China, such as Shanghai and its neighboring provinces.

The contractor shall determine the definitions of wages and earnings in China as well as the additional elements of compensation to the worker, aiming at coverage of the elements in the definition used in the BLS international comparisons, insofar as possible.

Some of the elements in the BLS definition may not be applicable to China, whereas there may be other elements of labor compensation unique to China that shall be investigated and documented.

The contractor shall determine the most feasible worker coverage for China, keeping in mind that the data shall be most useful for those parts of the Chinese manufacturing sector exposed to international competition.  The most feasible worker coverage is likely to be for full-time manufacturing workers in urban areas.  Some estimates of the numbers of part-time or part-year workers excluded from the comparisons shall be made.  If there are any wage data for the excluded persons, then the contractor shall report on the likely magnitude of bias of the full-time worker estimates.

The contractor shall determine the feasibility of providing wage and compensation data on an hourly basis.  If this is not feasible, then monthly or annual data shall be acceptable.

The contractor shall assess the comparability of the data on wages and earnings in terms of data collection methods and aggregation, sampling errors, reliability, and consistency.   The contractor shall note any areas in which the Chinese statistics deviate from accepted international norms (such as International Labor Office recommendations and international classification systems), as well as any cases in which uniquely Chinese factors may cause certain statistics to be misleading to U.S. data users.  Changes in definitions and methods made over the years shall be documented, and their impact on time series comparability noted.

As a part of the investigation, the contractor shall comment on the coverage and comparability of China’s data on trends and levels of manufacturing employment.

This study shall be limited to the time period 1990-2003 or the latest year that data are available.  The availability of data for years earlier than 1990 shall be noted.

The contractor shall identify areas where further research is needed.


III.  Work Plan
The Bureau of Labor Statistics shall provide the contractor with information on the methods and definitions used by BLS to compile and adjust foreign wage and compensation data to U.S. concepts.   The contractor shall then direct a search for the applicable wage and compensation data for China and proceed with the analysis leading to the paper described in the next section. 

If needed, conference calls shall be arranged between BLS staff and the contractor.  Otherwise, communications shall be via e-mail, fax, and/or regular mail.

The contractor shall make contacts with the appropriate personnel at China’s National Statistical Office in order to obtain the data and metadata (sources, methods, definitions, interpretations) needed for the project.  Contacts shall also be made with academics and other government officials to obtain further information relevant to the project.

IV.  Period of Performance

The period of performance of the contract shall be seven months beginning from the date of the award.

The contractor shall prepare a report describing the manufacturing wage and compensation data available for China and presenting results in a time series, noting deviations from the BLS international comparisons in terms of definitions and coverage.  The time period from 1990 to 2003 or the latest available year shall be covered.

Monthly progress reports shall be prepared and delivered to the contracting officer’s technical representative (COTR). 

The final report shall include the following:

1.	Describe China’s national and regional manufacturing employment, wage and earnings statistics in terms of sources, definitions, and coverage.
2.	Using a list of non-wage components of labor compensation provided by BLS, indicate which of these components are applicable to China’s manufacturing sector, and their sources, definitions, and coverage.
3.	Determine if there are elements of labor compensation in China’s manufacturing sector that are not on the BLS listing and provide information about them.
4.	Justify choice of geographic and worker coverage for the data to be presented, and for any other estimates or proxies used.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, Florida (NSWC-PC), intends to award a short term (6 month) sole&#64979;source simplified acquisition order to the Coastal Operations Institute of Panama City, FL for a continuation of analytical support in the planning for an integrated Gulf of Mexico (GoM) Maritime Operations Testbed that is  envisioned to provide the capability to evaluate advanced sensors, sensor systems, concepts, and tactics in situ.  Its unique combination of plug-and-playability, advantageous and accessible GoM location, and support of the Littoral Warfare community and the Joint Gulf Test Range (JGTR) make the testbed realization an imperative.  This requirement is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The COI is a 501(c)(3) corporation (not-for-profit), as defined by the Internal Revenue Service.  The COI members cooperatively p articipate in the development of solutions to pressing national problems in the coastal arena. These cooperative efforts span the broad areas of diving, advanced sensors, remote controlled vehicles, port security, intermodal transportation, concept development, modeling and simulation, test and evaluation, databases, and other areas specific to the development of cooperative technical approaches. Under the proposed purchase order, the Coastal Operations Institute will be tasked by the Government to technically support the NSWC-PC in conducting an analysis of the manner in which NSWC-PC should proceed with the implementation of a the testbed that can be utilized to increase NSWC-PC operating effectiveness. The Coastal Operations Institute is the only source available with the unique blend of demonstrated capabilities, knowledge and experiences in the realm of academic-industry-g overnmental partnering processes of the type anticipated to successfully complete the tasks required for accomplishment under this effort. The unique knowledge resident within Coastal Operations Institute within this area of expertise provides a knowledge base that would require an extensive, and prohibitively expensive, learning curve by any other vendor.  NAICS Code 541720 applies.  SBA Size Standard is 500 employees. FSC is B599.  A request for quotation will be utilized in awarding this action on or about 27 Apr 04.

<DESC>POC:  Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Tel: (703) 875-4357.  Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Damir Kopjar, Director, HEP Proizvodnja d.o.o., Misevecka 15 a, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, Phone: +385 (01) 6131 691, Fax: +385 (01) 6131 979.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of a new thermal power plant unit for the Croatian National Electricity Authority’s Hrvatske Elektroprivreda (HEP) system.

The TE-TO heating and power plant is one of the key heat and power production facilities in the Croatian National Electric Authority’s HEP system.    At present HEP owns and operates all of Croatia’s generation assets, which presently includes 3,502 MW of electricity generating capacity.  In order to keep pace with a 2.5% annual increase in electricity demand, HEP has initiated plans to develop a number of new units over the next 20 years, or else face serious electricity shortages.  

Presently, 36% of the power produced in Croatia is from hydro-electric plants.  Conventional thermal plants account for 31% and coal fired plans account for 9%.  The remaining 24% is imported.  Thermal power plants most often operate on fuel oil.  Much of the oil that HEP uses to operate its facilities is supplied by Industrija Nafte d.d. Zagreb (INA), Croatia’s National Gas company.  HEP uses only fuel oil with high sulfur content.  In the near future, the environmental laws will require the sulfur levels in fuel oil to be significantly reduced.  As INA improves fuel oil conversion, fuel oil availability will decrease.  

These two elements are the main force driving HEP to build more natural gas fired plants.  Because of the cost of natural gas, HEP plans to re-power their existing thermal plants with combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) to achieve the required efficiency.  The installation of the CCGTs would also create district heating as a byproduct.  This would result by taking the residual heat from the plant and transferring it to a hot water system that could provide heating for apartment buildings in a far more economical and efficient manner than at present.  

There are presently two main power blocks that makeup the TE-TO plant: Power Block 1 and Power Block 2.  In 1995, USTDA funded a feasibility study on the development of a new thermal power unit for Power Block 2.  As a result of the study, Power Block 2 was replaced with a new CCGT unit from General Electric.  Parsons Energy & Chemicals managed the construction of this unit.  HEP is now interested in replacing the existing Power Block 1 with a new CCGT unit.  Power Block 1 was originally constructed in 1958 and has been modified a number of times in the intervening years.  The boiler, turbine, generator, and associated equipment are reaching the end of their economic life and are in need of replacement.  As was the case with Power Block 2, it is intended that maximum use be made of the existing structure and infrastructure.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $457,890 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, June 1, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) FOR PRODUCING DISCOVERY LEARNING-BASED CLASSROOM PROGRAM FOR ARNGÃ¢Â€Â™S STRENGTH MAINTENANCE TRAINING CENTER 1.0 GENERAL INFORMATION  1.1  Project Background.  The Army National Guard (ARNG) Strength Maintenance Training Center located in Little Rock, AR is dedicated to increasing the End Strength of the ARNG. Strength Maintenance recognizes that to maintain short term recruiting gains a re not effective without equally aggressive attrition management and MOSQ retention programs.  To increase the focus on the combined importance of recruiting, retention and attrition management, Strength Maintenance seeks to develop a highly interactive, discovery learning-based classroom activity for debut at a June 2004 Strength Management Confere nce. The program will have further application as it rolls out to the Recruiting and Retention Force (RRF) and traditional M-Day soldiers. The success of this critical effort demands providing more than just information about the change in focus. The training program must compel ARNG Leadership and personnel to embrace a new reality by experiencing the need behind the shift to a new mindset, where End Strength is built and maintained through the three-pronged focus. In addition, the program must effectively communicate programs, steps and processes that have been put in place to support this new focus, and to provide real-life, day-to-day prac tical knowledge for RRF and traditional M-Day soldiers COs. 1.2  Audience.  This program is designed to focus the RRF on embracing the Strength Management philosophy to achieve end strength. 1.3  Learning Environment.  The initial session is target to be delivered during a conference of approximately 300 top ARNG Leaders at the PEC in North Little Rock, AR currently scheduled in June 2004. Subsequent rollout will be in classroom settings of ap proximately 20-30 individuals.  2.0 PROJECT REQUIREMENTS   2.1 Scope of Work.  The desired solution is a 60- to 90-minute activity centered on a table-sized, graphically intriguing and content-rich Illustrated Visual, custom created to communicate the ARNGÃ¢Â€Â™s message and content. Learning is to take place thro ugh a deck of engaging, learner-directed Activity Cards containing targeted questions or discussion points linked to the Illustrated Visual that guide participants to explore and discover key concepts. The Activity Cards should be easily customized to crea te 2-3 additional versions targeted to multiple ranks, roles and audiences.  In addition, the Contractor should propose optional 30-minute customized Ã¢Â€ÂœextensionÃ¢Â€Â activities that can be used with targeted learning groups following the initial rollout to provide a greater depth of knowledge and specific practices around key  content areas to be identified during the Data Gathering process. 2.1.1 Program Goal.  This program must gain leadership and soldier commitment around the equal criticality of the three tenets of the Strength Maintenance philosophy: recruiting, retention and attrition management. It must also communicate tactics that wil l ensure that all three can be achieved, and detail the programs, steps and processes that have been put in place to support this new focus. Specific objectives will be determined during Data Gathering. 2.1.2 Content.  While actual content will be established with the Contractor during Data Gathering, initial thinking is that the program would encompass the following topic areas: 2.1.2.1  Soldiers First Ã¢Â€Â“ Attack the  Mission of End Strength 2.1.2.2  Train and Retain Motivated Soldiers (both RRF Members and M-day Personnel) 2.1.2.3  Enlist Qualified Soldiers Who Refer Others 2.1.2.4  Create Ready Deployable Units at the Prescribed End Strength or Readiness Level (example, Small Unit Strength Cycle) 2.1.3 Instructional Activities and Strategies. ContractorÃ¢Â€Â™s proposal must describe how the solution will meet the follo wing requirements for activities and strategies: Ã¯Â‚Â· The solution should be participant driven, requiring only one leader/facilitator per session, and must be scalable for as few as 4 participants, up to and including several hundred. Ã¯Â‚Â· The solution must engage participants with a table-size, custom created Illustrated Visual that serves as the focal point for group interaction. Ã¯Â‚Â· The solution design must accommodate multiple Activity Card versions using the same Illustrated Visual. Ã¯Â‚Â· The solution must include recommendations for one or more 30-minute extension activities designed to provide participants with more detailed application of key concepts and increase their knowledge and skills in key areas to be identified during Dat a Gathering.  2.2 Deliverables.  Contractor is required to leverage existing Strength Maintenance content and combine with the communication needs of Strength Maintenance to create a unique and compelling message. The solution should consist of the components described  below. 2.2.1 Core Solution.  The ContractorÃ¢Â€Â™s description of Core components of the solution should detail the required elements described below. 2.2.1.1 Table-sized Illustrated Visual.  A table-sized, full-color Illustrated Visual that serves as the focal point for group interaction. The illustration is people-centered, engaging and rich with information. This program will be delivered to participa nts seated at tables of four to six. The number of tables can vary, ranging from just a few to a roomful. Working in small groups, participants will interact with the Activity Cards. 2.2.1.2 Activity Cards.  These spark team interaction, discovery and discussion by guiding participants to locate specific information on the Illustrated Visual. A variety of card format types should be provided to achieve the following: lead the participa nts as a group to discover key facts, spark focused conversation about a topic, engage participants in specific objectives and results, trends, etc.; give brief examples of actual successes by leaders and personnel; and/or spark discussion of both the bene fits and the uncertainties of change. Cards should consist of a core set to be used with the Leadership Conference group and, going forward, combined with Customized Activity Card Versions as appropriate for other audiences.  2.2.1.3 Customized Activity Card Versions.  To more closely target the communication and learning needs of other groups within Strength Maintenance, Contractor should describe how Activity Cards can be customized to cover other topics, using the same Visua l. 2.2.2 Optional Extension Activities.  The ContractorÃ¢Â€Â™s description of potential extension activities should detail recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of the Core Solution. The vision for these activities is to provide one or more 30-minute c ustom-designed activities to enforce key concepts presented in the Core Solution, and to provide deeper knowledge and practical skill-building opportunities. These activities would be implemented to various groups of participants following the initial Lead ership Conference rollout, and exact content would be determined during Data Gathering. 3.0 DEVELOPMENT PROCESS   3.1 Process Steps.

<DESC>CLARIFICATIONS TO QUESTIONS POSED IN RESPONSE TO THE SUBJECT ANNOUNCEMENT: (1).What type of information are you requesting that each interested vendor provide?  We would like the names of institutions that we can contact regarding the functioning of the product. (2) Could you indicate how you would like the stamping of the instruments to look? What method you prefer? We would like the initial stamping to be done of 7000 items by you and then subsequent stamping would be done by us [the end users in the OR].  Provide costs involved in our doing the stamping subsequently and the cost of the equipment and the alternate cost of your stamping the instruments. (3) What are your requirements for numbering e.g. alpha numeric, alpha or just numerical? Also should the codes be human readable as well machine-readable? We do not need the items to be read by humans, as they should be able to be passed under a scanner if the instrument needs to be identified.  The numbering system does not matter to us. (4) What types of information would you like stored about each piece e.g. location, times used, sterilization record.  We would like to know the following on each piece.  Location, date and time used, date of purchase, date and time sterilized, tray number to which it belongs. (5) Lastly do you require that software system be self-contained or do you have requirements for this system to be integrated to any other hospital information system? It should be a self-contained software package independent of hospital-wide systems.

Website Submission:  http://www.sainc.com/dso0412/.  The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) in the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) is interested in reviewing innovative research and development proposals on materials that exhibit negative index of refraction in the rf to optical frequency range. The vision for DARPA’s new start initiative, Negative Index Materials (NIM), is to further understand and explore the physics of left-handed transport and negative refractive index and to significantly expand the frequency range at which these phenomena are observed.  These materials were first considered theoretically in 1967 when a Russian theorist, Veselago, published a paper in which he considered the electrodynamics of materials with simultaneously negative dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability.  In this paper Veselago predicted a number of properties for such a material, should it exist, including the following: 1) the material would exhibit a negative index of refraction, in contrast to conventional materials that exhibit a positive index of refraction; 2) the material would exhibit “left-handed” propagation of electromagentic waves meaning that the phase and group velocities would be directionally opposed.  In 2000, the first reports of a “left-handed” or “negative index” material were published, and since that time many of Veselago’s original predictions have been verified experimentally or through extensive simulation.  Having confirmed the existence of negative refraction in resonant rf structures with negative permittivity and permeability, researchers are now postulating many exciting new DoD relevant applications for these materials.  These applications include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) lightweight, compact lenses with improved optics; 2) sub wavelength/high resolution imaging across the electromagnetic spectrum; 3) novel approaches to beam steering for radar, rf, and/or optical communications; and 4) novel approaches for integrating optics with semiconductor electronics.  Exploring the possible implementation of negative index materials for such applications will require significant enhancements in the properties of existing NIM materials (bandwidth, loss, operational frequency, etc.), as well as improved understanding of the physics of their electromagnetic transport properties.  Specific technical objectives of the DARPA/DSO NIM Program include the following:  1) understand and verify the physics and consequences of opposing group and phase velocities; 2) explore and demonstrate sub wavelength imaging using negative index materials; 3) expand the operational frequency range of negative index materials; and 4) understand and reduce the loss mechanisms of negative index materials for practical application.  These technical objectives are discussed in greater detail below. 
Understand and verify the physics and consequences of opposing group and phase velocities: The original theory proposed by Veselago postulated that an electromagnetic wave moving through a material with negative permittivity and permeability would exhibit opposing group and phase velocities.  Although recent experimental results and extensive simulation appear to be consistent with Veselago’s hypothesis, a definitive experiment to directly measure a negative phase advance inside a “left-handed” material has yet to be designed, let alone performed.  One direct consequence of a negative phase advance would be the potential to use this phenomenon to compensate for the positive phase advance of a wave that has propagated through a “right-handed” medium, such as free space.  Another consequence of opposing group and phase velocities would be the amplification of evanescent waves that would normally decay exponentially in a “right-handed” medium.  The recovery of information carried by evanescent modes could lead to lenses that are not diffraction limited, i.e., lenses that are capable of subwavelength imaging. Explore and demonstrate sub wavelength imaging using NIM: Subsequent to the first reports of NIM in 2000, it was further postulated (as discussed above) that the negative phase advance of an electromagnetic wave in a negative index material would lead to amplification of normally exponentially decaying evanescent modes.  While the exponential decay of these modes in conventional positive index/right-handed materials results in resolution limitations, the amplification of these modes in a negative index/left-handed material suggests the possibility of sub wavelength imaging beyond what is achievable using classical optics.  While recent experiments have provided some evidence for the transmission of evancescent modes through thin metallic surfaces, a demonstration of sub wavelength imaging has yet to be achieved.  Therefore, a demonstration of evanescent mode enhancement and sub wavelength image reconstruction (particularly at IR and optical frequencies) are important technical objectives that must be achieved in order to exploit NIM for future DoD imaging applications. Expand the operational frequency range of NIM: The NIM results reported to date have been demonstrated over a limited range of frequencies in the rf spectrum.  Due to the resonant nature of these NIM structures, bandwidth is also limited.  Since the negative refractive properties are attributed to a combination of negative permittivity and permeability, expanding the frequency range of operation up into the IR and optical spectrums will require the demonstration of materials that exhibit the appropriate dielectric and magnetic responses at these frequencies.  Recent experimental results have suggested the possibility of a magnetic-like response in resonant structures at THz frequencies.  However, the measurement and design of these structures are still very preliminary and in need of additional research.  Also, expanding the bandwidth of NIM structures will be important for many applications. Therefore, alternatives to “resonant” NIM structures need to be explored and demonstrated.  Potential solutions to bandwidth limitations include the use of active or tunable structures and/or the search for exotic new materials that exhibit intrinsic negative permittivity and permeability. Understand and reduce the loss mechanisms of NIM: Existing NIM have been demonstrated with losses below 1 db/cm.  However, these losses are anticipated to increase significantly at higher frequencies and may, ultimately, be unacceptable for many applications.  In addition, the mechanisms of loss in NIM are not completely understood.  Therefore, understanding the loss mechanisms and developing strategies to minimize loss in these materials are important technical objectives in order to realize the future potential for NIM in many DoD applications. In order to realize the vision of the NIM program, DARPA/DSO is soliciting innovative research and development proposals that address one or more of the technical objectives described above.  We encourage the formation of interdisciplinary teams integrated towards developing and demonstrating NIM that may some day be exploited in a variety of DoD relevant applications, such as those listed in this BAA Addendum.  While DARPA does not participate or provide direction in the formation of teams, in order to facilitate teaming opportunities, DARPA is sponsoring a Teaming Website at the following URL:  www.sainc.com/nim. Proposal Requirements: Only full proposals are being considered under this Addendum.  To receive consideration under this Addendum PROPOSALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 1600 EDT   JUNE 16, 2004, to the address shown below.  Proposals received after that date will be considered under the open BAA but not this Addendum. Proposers should submit proposals that describe a time phased materials development and demonstration program consisting of an 18 month Phase I and an 18-24 month optional Phase II.  While a system level demonstration of NIM is not the goal of this BAA Addendum, proposers should describe in detail how the anticipated application of NIM provides the overall direction and performance metrics for their proposed NIM development efforts.  Proposers should also quantitatively discuss how the realization of their proposed NIM application would be of benefit to DoD.  Specifically, the technical volume of full proposals submitted under this Addendum should contain an Executive Summary that clearly and concisely addresses the following questions:  1) What is the anticipated application of the proposed negative index material development effort? 2)  How and to what extent (be as quantitative as possible) is this application relevant to the DoD missions? 3)  Based on the anticipated application, what are the required performance goals for the negative index materials being proposed? 4)  How do the required performance goals quantitatively compare to what has already been demonstrated?  5)  How are the performance metrics proposed consistent with the technical objectives listed in this BAA Addendum?  6)  What are the quantitative 18 month Phase I milestones that would justify continued funding under the proposed optional Phase II effort?  7)  What are the optional Phase II quantitative milestones? The bulk of the technical volume should then describe in detail the proposed technical approach for achieving and demonstrating the stated negative index material performance metrics. Full proposals should be formatted and submitted in accordance with the instructions provided in the original FEDBIZOPS solicitation, BAA04-12 http://www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm.  To facilitate the submission process, a website has been established, http://www.sainc.com/dso0412. Evaluation of Proposals:

April 26, 2004.  Interested companies should also note the address of the State Environmental Protection Administration has recently changed to the above-referenced address.

POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Chunyan Liu, Department of Planning & Finance, State Environmental Protection Administration, 115 Xizhimennei Nanxiaojie, Beijing  100035, People’s Republic of China, Phone:  (8610) 67112251 / (8610) 67117995.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for Suzhou Central Hazardous Waste Management Facility.

With the recent SARS experience as a strong motivation, State Environmental Protection Agency of China (SEPA) issued draft regulations and standards on medical waste management, transport and incineration in June 2003 and final standards for hazardous waste (HW) incineration and secure landfilling in 2002.  To facilitate meeting these various obligations, SEPA and the Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning have drafted a National Hazardous Waste Management Plan (NHWMP) new hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities (TSDFs) over the next 2-3 years so that every industrialized area will have its own regional comprehensive hazardous waste management facilities with the most advanced areas developing additional TSDFs.  In addition, medical waste treatment centers, most involving incineration, will be developed around the country at the city and county levels.  

Of the 31 cities to receive new hazardous and medical waste TSDFs, Suzhou is among the 8 cities selected to serve as national demonstration centers for the rest of the country. A United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) grant was signed with the Suzhou Environmental Engineering Company (EEC), in partnership with the Suzhou Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB), to partially fund a feasibility study focused developing a new hazardous waste TSDF.  Suzhou wants to develop a minimum number of new centralized TSDFs according to a unified plan and thus be able to standardize waste management and emphasize specialized treatment capabilities.  Suzhou Solid Wastes Treatment and Disposal Center is planned to be the first such regional HW TSDF.  The local planning commission has approved the proposal which is now being reviewed by the national State Planning Council.  
 

The feasibility study will facilitate the introduction of U.S. HW recycling, solidification/stabilization, secure landfill and rotary kiln incineration consulting/engineering, technology/equipment, and O&M/owner possibilities to Suzhou for this project and future projects elsewhere in China that these HWMF developers may take on.  The study could result in $71.5 million in U.S. exports.  The study will conduct:  1) Technical Analysis; 2) Economic Analysis; 3) Financial Analysis; 4) Environmental Analysis including a preliminary environmental assessment of proposed project options; 5) Review of Regulatory Issues relating to hazardous wastes; 6) Proposal and identification of equipment for project implementation from prospective U.S. sources of supply and coordinate contact between Dadi and U.S. equipment sources; 7) Development of implementation plan comprised of a master plan and an action plan; and 8) Submission of Final Report. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $284,364 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, U.S. TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

 
Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Chinese directly to the Grantee by 12:00 noon, April 19, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

The Hangzhou Industry Solid Waste Disposal Station, developed and owned by Dadi, is SEPA’s first provincial-level HWMF demonstration project.  Dadi is near completion of its first phase of development whose treatment capacity is well below market demand.  Dadi is planning Phase 2 now, which focuses mainly on building additional infrastructure and capacity; they have selected a site, done evaluation work, and are preparing a feasibility study.

Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, U.S. TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want U.S. TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to U.S. TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to U.S. TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.

Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling U.S. TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this U.S. TDA financed activity.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in both English and Chinese directly to the Grantee by 12:00 noon, April 19, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.

The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information System Agency (DISA)/ Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization – Europe (DITCO-Europe) hereby issues the following Request for Information (RFI) regarding commercial satellite communications.  A. PURPOSE:  The Government seeks information for the provisioning of commercial satellite communications services for geographical areas consisting of South Africa, North Africa, Europe, the Balkans and Southwest Asia.  The information gathered from this RFI will assist in the development of a future Request for Proposal.  B. INTENT:  The RFI is intended to gather information about the availability of technology in the market place that will fulfill anticipated requirements for these services and other value-added elements.  Information submitted in response to this RFI will become the property of DISA.  DISA will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI.  Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.  DISA will not pay for information provided, and is not liable for any costs incurred by the company in response to this RFI.  Price quotes are not required, however, general cost estimates are appreciated to assist in planning.  Cost estimates provided will not be binding for the company.  C. DESIRED INFORMATION:  DISA desires information on industry capabilities to support the services and features listed below.  This list is neither detailed nor all-inclusive, but is a representative of the type of services DISA is interested in.  DISA will consider responses to this request for information in defining its requirements and alternatives.  SERVICES/FEATURES: A contract vehicle without monthly retainer fees and no charges for bandwidth unless utilized.  This would include access points into the Global Information Grid (GIG) at the Landstuhl, GE; Lago Patria, IT; and Ramstein AB, GE Teleport sites (Ku-band and C-band terminals).  Three additional access points would be via Ku-band into Patch Barracks, Vaihingen, GE (1.5M dish), Heidelberg, GE (2.4M dish), and Langare, IT. (1.5 or 2.4M dish).  Ku-Band and C-Band Satellite coverage for South Africa, North Africa, Europe, the Balkans and SWA.  As an initial capability the Government is interested in (2) 256kb portable links with Host Nation Approval and Frequency Clearance established for various training locations in UK, Italy, Germany.  SWE-DISH and Universal Satellite Communications (USC)-60 terminal users would access Ku-band satellite from the various training locations and terminate into the points of presence mentioned above.  These (2) links would also be used to support operations in the countries listed above. With the initial capability in place, we will look to “flex” that capability into larger chunks of bandwidth, as required, based on the following specific bandwidth/leadtimes:  (i) 1-3 quick reaction (72hour) satellite links between 256KB and 1MB.  A SWE-DISH Integrated Product Team (IPT) with .9M dish would be the terminal used in these situations.  This would be Ku-band only.  (ii) 5-7 satellite links (7-21 day notice) between 2.048MB-4.096MB.  A USC-60A terminal with 2.4M dish would be the terminal used in these situations. This could be Ku or C band.  (iii) 3-4 satellite links (21-45 day notice) between 4.096MB-8.192MB.  A USC-60A terminal with 2.4M dish or possibly terminals with a larger aperture antenna i.e. Deployable Ku-Band Earth Terminal (DKET) or leased terminal.  Ku or C band could be used.  US Military would be responsible for all terrestrial interconnects.  Host Nation Approval and Frequency clearance would be required for the certain training locations in Germany, UK and Italy to support the initial capability concept.  Future operations and locations would dictate the need for Host Nation Approval, landing rights, and frequency clearance processing.  No USC-60 or SWE-DISH terminal will support co-pol operations.  Government oversight of the commercial vendor.  Specifically, the government is interested in a single focal point of contact to coordinate the establishment or change of satellite links.  Contractor shall provide bandwidth management center (BMC) and network reporting capabilities.  Consolidation of all requirements in pursuit of better service and cheaper costs.  Host nation approval, frequency clearance processes to be completed by the contractor up front with a pre-provisioned transmission plan or in the interim while satellite access is activated.  D. SUBMISSION OF COMMENTS:  All comments in response to this RFI should be submitted electronically via e-mail not later than 30 April 2004 using MS Word 7.0 or later.  Comments received after that date may not be considered.  Proprietary information should be identified as such.  Responses to the RFI shall include the Company Name, Street Address, City, State, Country, zip code or postal code, Point of Contact (POC), POC Telephone, facsimile number and e-mail address.  If the company address includes a post office box, the complete street address must also be provided.  The point-of-contacts for submitting comments are Mr. Eric Kimery at kimerye@eur.disa.mil and Mr. Terry Green at greent@sembach.disa.mil.  Comments shall be submitted to both points of contacts.

<DESC>This synopsis requests information from the public, and in particular from local hospitals, on the information provided below.  Responses should be sent to the Contact Point and Contracting Office Address above.  The Clinical Research Program (CRP), Division of Intramural Research (DIR),  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to establish one or more clinical research units at local hospitals for purposes of recruitment and enrollment of patients into its clinical protocols.  The mission of the CRP, DIR is to engage in innovative clinical research in heart, lung, and blood diseases.  To this end, principal investigators in the CRP have written and successfully completed many protocols that explore the natural history and pathophysiology and develop novel therapies for the diseases studied.  However, the CRP lacks a sufficient patient base to carry out all its protocols.  Therefore, the CRP seeks to develop working relationships with local hospitals for the purpose of recruitment and enrollment of patients into protocols.

A Clinical Research Unit (CRU) is the means by which NHLBI plans to work with local hospitals.  A CRU will have the capability to address protocols encompassing specific heart, lung, and blood diseases that are of interest to the CRP.  It is envisioned that multiple CRU’s would be selected to receive basic indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  Then, each protocol would be issued to all IDIQ contractors.  Contractors would be given the opportunity to propose specifically on that protocol, or task, and typically only one would be selected to carry out the task represented by that protocol.  The selection of a contractor to perform a task would be based primarily on a contractor’s technical approach in terms of understanding of the research needs, expertise and experience of proposed staff, availability of a suitable patient population, and facilities available to carry out the protocol.  

The CRU will initially study the diseases and procedures below, with the understanding that the list may be expanded over time. 
	a.  Chronic coronary artery disease
	b.  Cardiac imaging (CT, MRI, Echo, Nuclear cardiology)
	c.  Congestive Heart Failure
	d.  Asthma
	e.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD)
	f.  Hemochromatosis
	g.  Chronic heart disease as found in cardiac rehabilitation programs.

The CRU approach is intended to bring together the scientific and clinical expertise of physician/scientists at NHLBI with practicing cardiologists and their patients at local hospitals.  The need is for a patient population that is willing to participate in research protocols that address the above list.  CRP’s experience with previously successful protocols is that interaction on protocols between clinicians and patients at local hospitals, and basic scientists working in the laboratory, has greatly improved the applicability and usefulness of the research being done. 

NHLBI is interested in learning the extent to which local hospitals would be willing to participate in this effort.  Is there sufficient interest in competing for the various protocols that will be issued to warrant an open competition?  Are the capabilities and commitments in place in local hospitals to make competition on a protocol-by-protocol basis a meaningful way to approach the integration of this research with the clinicians and their patients?  Are there modifications to this approach, or other approaches, that the local hospitals would like NHLBI to consider?    

This approach represents a potentially significant commitment on the part of local hospitals in terms of senior clinicians, nurses, office space and exam rooms, minor alterations and renovations needed to accommodate research protocols, operating expenses, and training of staff in carrying out research protocols.  Thus, we want to know whether local hospitals would be able to propose reasonable, competitive costs on a protocol-by-protocol basis?  

Research protocols will need to be approved by Institutional Review Boards at both the NIH and the local hospital site.  Can this be accommodated by local hospitals and are there any other issues of accessibility and patient safety, confidentiality and privacy that need to be considered in any solicitation that does result?  Also, since the collection of research data is likely to include potentially sensitive information on patients, and the Privacy Act is likely to apply to the systems of records used for collection of the research data, there probably will be a need for a hospital to address its automated system security approach.  Therefore, it is likely that staff who input and access the data collected will need security clearances.  Comments on this aspect of performing research on patients, and the impact it might have on the willingness of hospitals to participate, would be useful to NHLBI.  

This notice is provided as a Request for Information to help NHLBI further refine its plans and to obtain information as indicated above.  Any additional comments will be considered as well in developing the solicitation.   Interested parties should direct all comments to the Contracting Officer identified above by June 14, 2004.

<SUBJECT>R -- Continuation of Support for the Refugee Health Information Project
<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302 with the Center for Public Service Communications (CPSC), Arlington, VA for the continued development of a refugee health information network which provides multilingual and multicultural health information for refugees and their care providers, and to provide access to this information.  The period of performance shall be for one (1) year with four (4) successive one-year option periods.
 
Specifically, CPSC shall 1) act as liaison between the Department of Specialized Information Services (SIS) within NLM and the state refugee health programs in California and Florida and between these state programs and the formal Refugee Health Information Network (RHIN) being managed by Georgetown University, 2) work with participating state refugee health programs in California and Florida and their participating community health centers and refugee health clinics to monitor telecommunications connectivity and requirements and to ensure that participating sites maintain the required technology resources to participate in the RHIN project, 3) organize and convene ongoing planning and monitoring meetings with California and Florida state refugee health services and their respective community health center/refugee health clinics to develop and maintain the organizational structure that would ensure appropriate clinicians and health administrators receive training in how to use the Internet to gain access to health information relative to refugee and immigrant health services and health/disease conditions common among resettling refugees, 4) organize and convene training sessions in cooperation with the state refugee health programs in Florida and California designed to meet the needs of clinicians and health administrators and other care providers who require access to information on specific medical topics and on ways to improve services to resettled refugees and arriving immigrants.  These training programs will be held at NLM and at sites to be determined in California and Florida or other parts of the country, particularly in relation to national meetings.  They will be designed to provide participants with an introduction to NLM’s free medical, toxicological and environmental health databases and other resources on the Internet, 5) report on the progress of work at appropriate local and national meetings, 6) identify potential partners for expansion of the project.

The NLM determined CPSC to be uniquely qualified to perform these services.  CPSC is currently partnering with Georgetown University and serving as the coordinator of a project to develop a RHIN.  NLM is providing additional support to bring in two states not currently represented in the project.  

This service will be solicited using FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) procedures and awarded using FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions).  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available; however, all interested parties may submit a capabilities statement which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  Responses are required within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 04-118/NSD shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.

<SUBJECT>A -- UTILIZATION OF AN ALPHA-ADRENERGIC BLOCKING DRUG IN A NIH SPONSORED MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIAL IN MEN WITH CHRONIC PROSTATITIS/CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN SYNDROME
<DESC>NOTICE OF OPPORTUNITY FOR CLINICAL TRIAL COLLABORATION --

UTILIZATION OF AN ALPHA-ADRENERGIC BLOCKING DRUG IN A NIH SPONSORED MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIAL IN MEN WITH CHRONIC PROSTATITIS/CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN SYNDROME --

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks collaboration with industry to provide an alpha-adrenergic blocking drug and matching placebo for use in a National Institutes of Health sponsored multi-center clinical trial in men with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome.  

INTRODUCTION:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) is planning to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate if treatment with an alpha-adrenergic blocking drug will substantially reduce urinary symptoms in men with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain (CP/CPPS).   The trial will be conducted by investigators participating in the Chronic Prostatitis Collaborative Research Network (CPCRN).  The two-arm trial will enroll approximately 270 men and randomize them to either drug or placebo.  Treatment will be administered in a double-blind fashion.  The target population is men with CP/CPPS who have had recent onset of symptoms and are treatment naïve to alpha-adrenergic blocking drugs.   Enrollment, expected to take approximately three years, will be performed at the following participating clinical centers: Northwestern University, the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of Washington, the University of Maryland, Temple University, Massachusetts General Hospital, Cleveland Clinic Foundation (Weston, FL), the University of Mississippi, Queen’s University (Kingston, Ontario, Canada), Stanford University and the VA Puget Sound Health Care System. Central data collection and analysis will be performed by the NIDDK funded Data Coordinating Center at the University of Pennsylvania.

STUDY GOALS:  The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to determine if treatment with an alpha-adrenergic blocking drug for a period of 12 weeks will significantly reduce urinary symptoms associated with CP/CPPS compared to placebo.  The primary outcome is a change (reduction) in symptoms as assessed by the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI).  The Global Response Assessment (GRA) as well as other clinical and laboratory measures will be examined. 

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:  In 2003, the NIDDK established the second 5-year phase of the Chronic Prostatitis Collaborative Research Network. The purpose of the CPCRN is to conduct high quality randomized controlled clinical trials in men with CP/CPPS.  In the first 5-year segment of this program investigators conducted a randomized double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial of  an alpha-adrenergic blocking drug and an antibiotic in heavily pre-treated men with longstanding symptoms characteristic of CP/CPPS.  The outline of a protocol for a second trial to evaluate an alpha-adrenergic blocking drug has been recently approved by an independent NIDDK appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Board.  It is anticipated that patient recruitment will begin in the summer 2004.  However, the Collaborator will have the opportunity to comment on the study protocol prior to implementation.  The Collaborator providing the alpha-adrenergic blocking drug will be expected to provide drug without charge for the 12-week drug treatment period for approximately 270 study participants. The Collaborator will also provide sufficient matching placebo without charge.  

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” to help in their deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that qualified applicants will have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their Capability Statements.  Capability Statements related to treatment with an alpha-adrenergic blocking drug for substantially reducing urinary symptoms in men with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain (CP/CPPS) and should address the following criteria: time line for ability to provide drug and placebo after selection of Collaborator is determined, approved daily dose of drug, previous studies of efficacy of drug in treating men with lower urinary tract symptoms and known side-effects of drug.  Capability Statements may not exceed 10 pages.

TERMS:  The Collaborator will be expected to execute a Clinical Trial Agreement, an example of which can be found at http://techdev.niddk.nih.gov/forms.htm  No funding from the Government is available.  
 
SUBMISSION DATES:  A written statement of interest must be submitted by May 20, 2004 and all Collaborator Capability Statements must be submitted by June 2, 2004.

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks collaboration with industry to provide a urinary alkalinizing agent and matching placebo for use in a National Institutes of Health sponsored multi-center clinical trial in patients with the painful bladder syndrome, including interstitial cystitis.  

INTRODUCTION:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) is planning to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate if treatment with a urinary alkalinizing agent will substantially reduce urinary symptoms in patients with the painful bladder syndrome (PBS), including interstitial cystitis.   The trial will be conducted by investigators participating in the Interstitial Cystitis Clinical Research Network (ICCRN).  The two-arm trial will enroll approximately 260 patients with PBS and randomize them to either a urinary alkalinizing agent or placebo.  Treatment will be administered in a double-blind fashion.  The target population is patients with PBS who are either newly diagnosed, have had recent onset of symptoms, or have not been previously treated for this condition.   Enrollment, expected to take approximately three years, will be performed at the following participating clinical centers:  the University of Maryland,  Queen’s University (Kingston, Ontario, Canada), Stanford University, the University of Rochester, Henry Ford Hospital, William Beaumont Hospital (Royal Oak, MI), Loyola University Medical Center, University of Iowa,  and the University of Pennsylvania. Central data collection and analysis will be performed by the NIDDK funded Data Coordinating Center at the University of Pennsylvania.

STUDY GOALS:  The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to determine if treatment with a urinary alkalinizing agent for a period of 6 weeks will significantly reduce urinary symptoms associated with PBS compared to placebo.  The primary outcome is a change in a Global Response Assessment (GRA).  Secondary endpoints include several symptom indices, quality of life, and bladder diaries. 

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:  In 2003, the NIDDK established the second 5-year phase of the Interstitial Cystitis Clinical Research Network. The purpose of the ICCRN is to conduct high quality randomized controlled clinical trials in patients with the painful bladder syndrome (including interstitial cystitis).  In the first 5-year segment of this program (known previously as the Interstitial Cystitis Clinical Trials Group) investigators conducted two randomized double-blind placebo controlled clinical trials; one trial evaluated the effects of hydroxyzine and pentosan polysulfate sodium and another examined the effects of intravesical administration of Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG).  Both trials were double-masked.  The outline of a protocol for a clinical trial to evaluate a urinary alkalinizing agent has been recently approved by an independent NIDDK appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Board.  It is anticipated that patient recruitment will begin in the summer 2004.  However, the Collaborator will have the opportunity to comment on the study protocol prior to implementation.  The Collaborator providing the alkalinizing agent will be expected to provide without charge sufficient drug for the 6-week drug treatment period for approximately 260 study participants. The Collaborator will also need to provide sufficient matching placebo without charge.   

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” to help in their deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that qualified applicants will have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their Capability Statements.  Capability Statements related to use of a urinary alkalinizing agent to significantly reduce urinary symptoms associated with PBS should address the following criteria: time line for ability to provide drug and placebo after selection of Collaborator is determined, approved daily dose of the alkalinizing agent, previous studies of efficacy of the agent in treating patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and known side-effects of the agent.  Capability Statements may not exceed 10 pages.

TERMS:  The Collaborator will be expected to execute a Clinical Trial Agreement, an example of which can be found at http://techdev.niddk.nih.gov/forms.htm  No funding from the Government is available.  
 
SUBMISSION DATES:  A written statement of interest is requested to be submitted by May 20, 2004 and all Collaborator Capability Statements must be submitted by June 2, 2004.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-08.  The NAICS Code is 517510 with a small business size standard of $12.5 million.  It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis with Comcast Online, P.O.Box 827554, Philadelphia, PA for the requirement of high speed internet services.    This is a continuation of existing services.  Comcast has been providing these services to the NLM for the past five years and is the only known source of providing these services. Comcast is the largest provider of Broadband services in the country with a presence in 40 states, and reach into 40% of U.S. households including more than 70% coverage of the greater D.C. market.   Cable companies in most cases do not overlap geographically.  Therefore, cable Internet services are usually only available from a single provider in any given geographic area.  For example, in the greater D.C. area, Comcast is the primary cable provider in Montgomery, Prince George, Prince William, Arlington, Alexandria, and Reston, VA.  DSL bandwidth is distance sensitive and hence is not available in many areas, and not available with enough bandwidth for NLM's applications in other areas.  Hence Comcast service or cable services is the only known option available.   Comcast offers speeds of up to 3.0 Mbps downstream and 256 Kbps upstream on their Teleworker Standard product and 4.0/384K on their Enhanced product.   DSL upstream speeds that are 128K are unsuitable for the purpose of NLM’s requirement.   Comcast does not resell Commercial Internet services through any 3rd parties at this time. 
The services are for a base year with two additional option years.  The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web site http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/SAP/sap.htm :  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors; 52.212-3, Offeror’s Representations and Certifications; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions, and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions required to implement Statutes. This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible and responsive sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the services as specified above.  Responses should demonstrate the firm’s ability to meet the government’s requirements.  Responses are required within 7 (seven) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 04-117 shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  RESPONSES SHALL BE SENT VIA EMAIL TO: KS367b@NIH.GOV.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Kala Shankar, Contract Specialist (301) 496 6546 or Karen Riggs, Contracting Officer, (301) 496 6127.

Contact Frank Moretti who can be reached at 215-697-9611 or email frank.moretti@navy.mil.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency.  No Numbered Notes apply.  52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement.  The Government will award a firm fixed priced purchase order resulting from this synopsis/ solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote, conforming to the synopsis/solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government may award a single contract for both the desktops and laptops or make a split award for each of the systems. The evaluation of quotes will consider the quoter’s Technical Quote more important than the quoter’s Price Quote. The following technical factors shall be used to evaluate quotes and are listed in descending order of importance: Technical Capability, Past Performance. Technical Capability –The quoted units are to be loaded with a Government-owned, non-classified software application to determine whether the software can operate within the units. If compatible with the Government-owned software, the quoted units will then be evaluated to determine how fast the software operates in the quoted units.  Second, quoters shall provide a technical data sheet and/or specifications for both the quoted desktops and laptops.   Past Performance - The quoter shall describe its past performance on directly related or similar contracts it has held within the last five (3) years which are of similar scope, magnitude, and complexity to that which is detailed in the synopsis/solicitation or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance. Quoters who describe similar contracts should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts to the requirements of the synopsis/solicitation.  The quoter should provide the following information regarding its past performance: a) Contract Number(s), b) Name and telephone number at the Federal, State, Local Government or Commercial entity for which the contract was performed, c) Dollar value of the contract, d) Detailed description of the work performed, e) Names of subcontractor(s) used, if any, and a description of the extent of the work performed by the subcontractor(s), f) The number, type, and severity of any quality, delivery or cost problems in performing the contract, the corrective action taken and the effectiveness of the corrective action. The Government reserves the right to obtain information for evaluating past performance from any and all sources outside the Government. Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of an quoter with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the quotes of other quoters. The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  If an quoter fails to provide any past performance information which is similar in scope, magnitude and complexity to that which is detailed in the RFP or fails to affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance, the quote may not be awardable. The Government will consider the quality of quoter’s past performance. This consideration is separate and distinct from the Contracting Officer’s responsibility determination. The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the quoter and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ. In determining the rating for the past performance evaluation factor, the Government will give greater consideration to the contracts which the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ. The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The information should include   discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter. The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government. Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters. The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance. The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ. The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ. Addenda to FAR 52.212-1 is DFARS 252.204-7004 entitled "Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at https://www.ccr.dlis.dla.mil/ccr/scripts/index.html . All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements. Note: All information technology items must be Year 2000 compliant.  Year 2000 compliant means information technology that accurately processes date/time data (including, but not limited to, calculating, comparing and sequencing) from, into and between the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and the years 1999 and 2000, and leap year calculations. Furthermore, Year 2000 compliant information technology, when used in conjunction with other information technology, shall accurately process date/time data if the other information technology properly exchanges date/time data with it.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR CONSTRUCT CUSTOM TABLES.	Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions and extend the hour and date specified for the receipt of Offers.  Question #1:  The grommets specified are very expensive.  We believe that a cost savings could be incurred using regular grommets.  Would regular grommets be acceptable? Answer #1: Offerors must propose in accordance with the specifications in the solicitation. Question #2: The 22 x 72 x 1/8” polycarbonate sheet.  Would we assume that these items would be shipping loose?  I can’t tell from the drawing if its somehow attached somewhere. Answer #2: The polycarbonate sheets can be shipped loose. Question #3:  Would a front rail under the front of the work surface be allowed?  Front rail could be pushed back to clear the hole patterns in your top, if necessary, and would help greatly in meeting load requirements. Answer #3: A front rail under the front of the work surface is not allowed. Question #4: Cross support between feet allowed?  Again, this would be an advantage in meeting load requirements. Answer #4: Cross support between feet is not allowed. Question #5: Can a 2’ square tube, 16 gauge, be used in place of the requested 1 x 2 tube? Answer #5: No, a 2’ square tube cannot be used.   Question #6: Recommended corner radius for t-mould on the requested work surfaces would be 1” (vs. the 3/8” spec’ed) for proper fit. Answer #6: 1” radius can be used. Question #7: Should we assume that the legs of riser shelf are manufactured with the same materials as the work surfaces (vs steel for instance)? Answer #7: The legs for the risers are to be steel, not the same material as the work surface. Question #8: The work surfaces were requested to be made of MDF, 1.25 thick.  MDF is only available in 4 x 8 sheets in the 1.25” which does not give an optimal yield for 36x72 stations.  We will quote the stations in 1.25” MDF but please be advised that 1” MDF or 1.25” particle board would be a cost savings. Answer #8: The 1.25 MDF requirement helps to meet the load requirement and thus is needed.  No replacement will be accepted. Question #9: Note 8 calls for one (1) ¼” thick transparent clear polycarbonate sheet to be supplied per table, see detail 99.  The detail calls for the sheets to be 22” x 72”, will these just lie loose on the plastic laminate work surface? Answer #9:  Yes, the sheets are loose on the top to hold down papers underneath. Question #10: There are four (4) 2.750 diameter holes shown in the top of the riser shelf and also in the top of the writing surface, trimmed with black grommets.  Is this correct? Answer #10: Yes, that is correct. Question #11: Detail E shows a 1.75 dia. Hole and two .191 dia. Holes  Does the 1.75 hole get a grommet and what is the purpose of the two .191 holes? Answer #11: The 1.75 hole does not get a grommet.  The .191 holes are starter holes for screws that will hold hardware to be installed by user. Question #12: Is the finish on the table legs wrinkle finish or smooth? Answer #12: The finish on the table legs is a smooth finish. Question #13: What is the depth of the shelf and riser on top? Answer #13: View A gives dimension of top shelf as 14”. Dimension of work service is 36” Question #14: Can proposals be faxed or emailed? Answer #14: Yes, fax or email are the preferred method of receiving the proposals.	Fax to Ginny Stephenson at 281-483-4173 or email: virginia.c.stephenson@nasa.gov. Question #15: Views A, B, C do not list the depth of the main surface. Answer #15: 36” is the depth of the main surface. Question #16: Views A, B, C do not list the depth of the riser surface. Answer #16: 14” is the depth of the riser surface. Question #17: Please explain what detail E is.  It appears to be a cut out in the surface. Answer #17: It is the cutout for a piece of hardware in the main worksurface. Question #18: Please confirm the depth of the legs. Answer #18: Depth of legs is 30.5” Question #19: The bid does not indicate if product is to be assembled and installed or shipped kd dock to dock. Answer #19: Product must be assembled and shipped to our dock. The due date for receipt of offers is extended to April 15, 2004, 4:30pm CST. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on April 15, 2004.

 2. The blasted surfaces will be in a near-white condition per Steel Structures Painting Council (SSPC-SP 10-85).

At least 95% of each square inch of surface area shall be free of all visible residues, and the remainder shall be limited to the light discoloration mentioned above. The National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) Standard TM-01-70 (Visual Standard for Surfaces of New Steel Airblast Cleaned with Sand Abrasive) will be used as a guide to ensure a near-white surface was produced. The blast-cleaned surface must be primed before any rusting occurs; otherwise the benefit of the Near White Blast Cleaning is lost.  Under normal atmospheric conditions it is best practice to prime within 1 hour of blast cleaning."

<ARCHDATE>05112004
<CONTACT>Walter Walter, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-343-9216, Fax null, Email walters@orha.centcom.mil
<DESC>This is Amendment 0001 to W914NS-04-Q-0161:  

Question 1:  At present the standard bogies of Load 20 T/axle and speed 100 km/h is a bogie Y25 Rs (it replaces the bogie Y25 Cs).  Can we offer a bogie Y25 Rs?  
Answer 1:  No.  

Question 2:  For the load weight of 46t (propane) the wagon capacity is 11m3.  At this capacity and at this wagon weight, approximately 33t max and max load 20t/axle, the load capacity for mixture propane-butane is 47t.  Please accept.  
Answer 2:  No.  

Question 3:  Sun guard is made according to RID.  
Answer 3:  Yes.  

Question 4:   According to requirements, the tank must be equipped with internal wash plates (against waves).  At the present time, construction in Europe does not use these partitions (wash plates).  The tank has internal stiffening rings.  Is there a need to use partitions?  
Answer 4:  No.  

Question 5:  According to RID, the test pressure is max. 25 bars.  Wagon weight was calculated for the test pressure 25 bars.  Increase of the pressure to 34 bars, according to your demand, will cause the wagon weight to increase and to decrease the load capacity.  Do you accept the 25 bars pressure?  
Answer 5:  No.  

Question 6:  According to UIC/RID for this type of wagon, the speeds are the following - 120km/h for empty wagons, 100km/h for loaded wagons.  Please confirm these values.  
Answer 6:  These values are correct.  

Question 7:  The wagon is equipped with SA3 couplers.  Is it necessary to equip the wagons both with the SA3 coupler and buffers? (in this case the construction of front part will not meet all UIC requirements)  
Answer 7:  Yes.  

Question 8:  Is the wagon to be prepared for installing buffers in the future according to UIC?  
Answer 8:  No.  

Question 9:  Can we use brake system Knorr KE-GP-A that meets requirements but has a different distribution valve than demanded by the specifications.  This valve is commonly used by Knorr (KE2dSL/D).  
Answer 9:  No.  No change in the Knorr brake equipment will be considered, nor any other brand.  

Question 10:  We propose that the hand braked be controlled from the brake platform.  
Answer 10:  Not acceptable.  

Question 11:  Commonly used fastening of measuring instruments (thermometer, pressure meter, indication of filling) installed on the bottom with reading from brake platform.  Is this acceptable?  
Answer 11:  Yes.  

Question 12:  What is the length of the wagon?  
Answer 12:  The total length of the wagon over the buffers is 18,000mm at opposite ends.  The 1,750 mm would seem reasonable for the width between the buffers at one end.  


Question 13:  Must the prototype wagon be tested according to the full program set by ERRI B12/RP17 or only part of it?  In that case, which components of the program? (complete testing lasts about 4-5 weeks).  
Answer 13:  The complete wagon shall be tested.  

Question 14:  We understand that you want SA3 central automatic couplers (but within UIC specs concerning height above rail), combined with buffers (this combination is common in the Middle-east).  Is this correct?  
Answer 14:  SA3 Russian couplers with buffers are required; the maximum height above rail level is 1060mm, the distance between buffer centers is 1750mm.  

B)  Clarifications  

Clarification 1:  The actual weight/tare weight of the wagon shall not exceed 35 tons.  
Clarification 2:  Double flexible air brake connections are mandatory. Single flexible air brake connections will not be considered.  
Clarification 3:  Delivery of the LPG Wagons by rail is acceptable.  

D)  The following clause, 52.211-9 Desired and Required Time of Delivery, is hereby incorporated into the solicitation:  

Desired and Required Time of Delivery (June 1997)  

(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule: 270 Days ARO.  

If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below. However, the offeror's proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government's required delivery schedule as follows:  360 Days ARO.  

Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.  

(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.
