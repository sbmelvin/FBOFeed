The Hewlett Packard DL380G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580G4 SMART servers, along with these other components, have been identified as key components of the Departmentýs SMART server infrastructure.   IRM ITCCB approved the use of these Hewlett Packard Servers for unclassified networks.   These servers were tested by the Department for hardware and software compatibility.  These specific servers provide integrated management functions with existing equipment maximizing our return on training investment for support personnel. In addition, the various anticipated Operations and Maintenance owners of SMART deployed technologies utilize similar equipment at this time.   As the SMART program exists for a finite duration, the program seeks to minimize the burden placed on existing O&M organizations by using similar technologies as those already deployed. Furthermore, these setups are matched to specific configuration needs in the DoS that recur on a regular basis making them virtually interchangeable and simplifying our spare part logistic needs.  Finally, standardization preserves our ability to more easily expand with newer server models from the same manufacturer and achieve economies of scale, particularly in test and development environments, with lower overall cost.  Required Hewlett Packard DL380G5, Hewlett Packard DL580 G4, servers, and related infrastructure equipment (described above and in the attached) are required for SMART. These servers have been identified as key components of the Departmentýs SMART server infrastructure which will provide Command and Control message handling, collaboration, Archive and Records Management functions for the Department of State. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements as a key component of the Departmentýs networking system. The Hewlett Packard DL380G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580G4 servers have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and are approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.<BR><BR>

<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of Microtechnologies for Air-Cooled Exchangers (MACE).   The primary goal of this program is the development and demonstration of air-cooled exchangers that offer significant reductions in thermal resistance (from case to air) and significant reductions in the total electrical power used to force the air through the system.  Possible approaches to these program goals could include the development of innovative concepts for modification of the airflow through the exchanger, such as with synthetic jets, moving mechanical structures, or surfaces that offer enhanced convective heat transfer.  Approaches that improve the thermal conduction from the base to all the surfaces of the exchanger are also likely to be important.  Approaches that reduce the airflow resistance of the exchanger so that the blower can operate at lower power are of interest.  Approaches that improve the efficiency of the blower are also of interest.  DARPA is interested in approaches that utilize combinations of enhanced convection and conduction in addition to reduced airflow resistance and improved blower efficiency, or any subset thereof that can meet the program requirements.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.  Proposal abstracts are due no later than 12 March 2008.  Full proposals are due no later than 14 May 2008.  See attached BAA 08-15 solicitation document dtd 8 January 2008.

An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>NASA Headquarters (HQ), Facilities and Administrative Services Division, is planning to procure additional Motorola UHF communications portable radio systems and equipment for the HQ?s Emergency Management and Safety Group.  The Headquarters Emergency Management and Safety group needs secure portable radios to communicate with the HQ Security force during emergencies and other events affecting the HQ facility and or its occupants.    Wireless Communications, Inc. has installed and currently maintains NASA HQs Motorola UHF two-way radio systems which includes on-site repeaters with a split antenna system, base stations and portable radios. Wireless Communications Inc. holds the system key for programming the frequency?s, PL codes, band-split and MDC1200 signaling of unit ID?s.  The programming of additional radios will need to match the existing portables, base stations and repeaters, so that they do not cause interference with other Federal Government agencies located in the immediate area.  Wireless Communications, Inc. has maintained and updated the data base for all radios utilized within the NASA Headquarters facility.  The existing antenna system was engineered and installed by Wireless Communications Inc.  Coverage within the building and surrounding area has been tested and found to meet the requirements of NASA Headquarters.  Wireless Communications Inc. maintains the serialized equipment list that matches the unit ID?s associated with each radio.  Wireless Communications Inc is the only Motorola Authorized Sales and Service facility located in Washington, DC. It is in the best interest of the government to continue with the current contactor because of system key programming security and duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Therefore, NASA/HQ intends to issue a Sole Source Procurement to purchase the additional Motorola UHF communication devices from Wireless Communications, Inc., Baltimore, MD.

<DESC>This proposed procurement is a continuation of an existing contractual agreement with Galorath Incorporated to support NASA Headquarters (HQ), Program Analysis and Evaluation Office and six (6) NASA centers under a corporate or agency-wide site license agreement.  Galorath's SEER series estimation and analysis tools define, analyze and manage software, hardware and DFM projects, from early concepts through upgrade and maintenance phases. Galorath's SEER-SEM is a powerful decision-support tool that estimates the cost, labor, staffing, schedule, reliability, and risk for all types of software development and/or maintenance projects. SEER-H support tool provides Lifecycle Cost (LCC) for any scale hardware project, from individual components to a variety of complete product assemblies including ground, air, space and sea vehicles, electronic devices, industrial equipment, consumer electronics and appliances. Galorath's SEER tools derive cost, schedule and staffing estimates by assessing the interaction and impact of product, organizational and even operational variables. This parametric methodology, coupled with the industry's most comprehensive knowledge bases, creates a rapid and powerful view of the critical factors driving program decision and determining success. Galorath SEER has been used in over 75 NASA project cost estimates since 2001. Continued use of Galorath SEER model ensures continuity of NASA cost estimates throughout the agency thereby assuring consistent comparison of project performance and cost growth.  Therefore, it is in the best interest of the government to continue using the Galorath SEER series. Therefore, NASA/HQ intends to issue a Sole Source Procurement for the continuation of an existing contractual agreement with Galorath Incorporated, El Segundo, CA.  The authority is FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) "only one responsible source"  When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need no be provided for.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) FSIS-03-B-08 for biological screen tests for the detection of antimicrobial residues in animal tissues.  This in-plant test was developed by FSIS and is called the Fast Antimicrobial Screen Test (FAST).  FAST is capable of detecting beta lactams (both penicillins and cephalosporins), aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and sulfas.  In these tests, cotton swabs saturated with tissue fluid from a suspected carcass are placed on a culture plate whose surface has been seeded with spores of a harmless organism (Bacillus megaterium spores for the FAST test).  The primary contract specialist can provide more details on FAST procedures upon an offerors request.  The Government estimates 125,000 FAST tests are used annually.  The contractor will be responsible for quantitative analysis that may exceed 3,000 samples per year for a given project.  Offerors must provide the facilities, personnel, and the capacity to handle the volume of samples required by this effort.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325413, In-Vitro Diagnostic Substance Manufacturing, and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  This procurement will be conducted as a Commercial Item acquisition under FAR Part 12; however, the Government reserves the right to solicit as a noncommercial item if determined necessary.  Offerors will be required to submit a technical and price proposal for evaluation by the Government.  The period of performance will be for a 12 month base period plus four (4) additional 12 month option periods.  Award will be made to the offeror who submits the proposal considered most advantageous to the Government considering price and technical evaluation factors.  The offers must conform to the RFP instructions and be received by the closing date specified in the RFP.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) intends to solicit proposals using full and open competition on an unrestricted basis as a follow-on to contract  N01-ES-15478 awarded to the University of Washington.  This notice is a re-announcement of the requirement previously described under solicitation number NIH-ES-07-05 which did not result in award of a contract.

Contract objectives include 1) establish a catalog of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in prioritized environmental response genes (ERGs) based on direct re-sequencing of selected genes; 2) use high-throughput sequencing technologies for rapid sequencing analysis utilizing a national sample repository for analysis of sequence variation in the U.S. population and make this data available to the scientific community via centralized public databases; 3) develop web-based tools to display estimated haplotypes and linkage disequilibrium patterns in human populations using the EGP data sets; 4) evaluate the population distributions of estimated haplotypes and identify evolutionary patterns among the human populations represented in the polymorphism discovery resource samples; and 5) mine the sequence variation in EGP genes to highlight potential functional coding or non-coding variants for further biological testing. 

Specific performance will involve re-sequencing up to a total of seventy-five (75) gene equivalents (GE) over a four (4) year period from genomic DNA obtained from a sample of ninety-five (95) ethnically defined individuals, data entry and validation.  

The estimated release date for the solicitation is mid to late January of 2008. The estimated receipt date for proposals is early to mid March of 2008.  Electronic versions of the RFP will be available at http://www.niehs.nih.gov/omamb/rcb/rfp.htm.    All eligible responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered. See numbered note 26.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) has the stated mission to reduce the burden of neurological disease, a burden borne by every age group, by every segment of society, by people all over the world.  Within this mission falls gene discovery. Gene discovery elucidates the cause of some diseases, and also, the underlying pathogenesis of related disorders.  Genetic studies of neurological disorders are increasing in number and complexity.  Such studies require a large and diverse sample and accompanying information base.  The NINDS Human Genetics Repository, established in 2002 via contract with the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, receives, stores, and distributes DNA, Cell Lines, and accompanying clinical and genotypic data to the Neuroscience community.  The resultant contract from this re-competition will build upon the existing infrastructure to support and encourage gene discovery, serving the mission of NINDS.  The current collection consists of over 16,000 genetic samples.  An additional 20,000 to 30,000 samples from unique individuals are expected to be collected under the new contract over a five year period.  The Repository acts in a service capacity to facilitate the goals and specific scientific aims of NINDS grantees and other scientists studying neurological disorders.  Ongoing collection, curation, and distribution will allow collection of a sample set that is large enough to discover common genetic risk factors for neurological disorders.  It will also ensure that a standardized, useful dataset of demographic, other phenotypic, and genotypic data is shared via a project-specific website and other such resources such as the National Library of Medicine?s database of genotype and phenotype (DbGaP) in accordance with NIH policy on shared resources.  Personnel with established expertise in DNA preparation, lymphoblast immortalization/cell line preparation, data management and database design, power analysis/statistical support for genetic studies, and biological materials receipt, storage and distribution will be needed to perform this project.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FOLLOW-UP GENERAL OBJECTIVES AND REQUIREMENTS 1.  Title of Project:  VISN 9 MidSouth Customer Accounts Center (MCAC) - Account Receivable Follow-up, Claims less than $250 and less than 90 days old. 2.  Background:  The VA's revenue program is responsible for billing to and collecting from an insurance company for medical treatment provided to a veteran for a non-service connected condition.  Public Law 99-272 granted VA authority to seek reimbursement from third party health insurers for the cost of medical care furnished to an insured nonservice-connected (NSC) veteran.  Public Law 101-508 expanded VA's recovery program by providing authority to seek reimbursement from third party payers for the cost of medical care provided to insured service-connected veterans treated for their NSC conditions.   3.  Purpose of Project:  The primary purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to accomplish the following 3rd party Accounts Receivable objectives:  "	Collection and follow-up on all open 3rd party accounts receivable assigned to the contractor by the MCAC to achieve optimum collection from the insurance carrier(s)  "	Follow-up activities are appropriately documented in the AR Comment field in VistA "	Results of follow-up activity are provided monthly to the MCAC "	Follow-up on all receivables at intervals established with the MCAC, until they are recommended for closure resulting from an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) with valid documented justification (e.g., insurance terminated, not a covered service), or paid by the insurance carrier   "	Claims that are appealed for medical reasons are referred, on a daily basis,, at minimum on a weekly basis,  to the appropriate MCAC staff to complete the appeal process and specific information needed for the appeal is provided by the contractor "	The MCAC retains the right to assign or not assign contractor to re-bill/re-print claim "	VISNs/VAMCs retain the right to assign or not assign contractor to re-bill claims. "	Mutually agreed upon time schedules and deadlines are met  consistent with VA policies and procedures "	Follow-up priorities regarding aged receivables are established "	Contractor maintains timely and meaningful communications with appropriate MCAC staff  Additionally, this SOW shall establish and maintain a productive cost-effective AR follow-up system that: "	Allows the MCAC to meet and/or exceed their MCCF goals by optimizing third party reimbursements, in part through aggressive follow-up on account receivables (AR)   "	Incorporates performance metrics that monitor the accuracy and timeliness of the system    4.  Scope of Work:    	Solicitation is for the following tasks.  The contractor shall: Review and analyze placed claims to determine the appropriate actions required for accurate claims processing by the third party payer.  Contractor will document any notes regarding conversations with carries or veterans, appeals submitted, corrections submitted, rebills submitted, payment postings/mispostings/offsets, and any other activities related to the proper disposition of such claims.  Contractor will gather information necessary to further claims processing via Vista VPN access granted by the VA.  Contractor will continue follow-up on all claims until complete resolutions (paid or otherwise deemed uncollectible), or until receivable is aged past the contract stipulations.  The following guidelines will apply: o	The Contractor shall contact the third party payer, either through web access to carrier systems, automated telephone systems, or actual telephone conversations with carrier representatives, to discuss and obtain appropriate rebilling and/or denial information.  The Contractor shall batch claims by payer for contact purposes in order to maximize efficiency. o	The Contractor shall contact the carriers for unpaid claims in accordance with VA Handbooks and local requirements. o	Upon contact with an insurance carrier, the Contractor will electronically document the following:  (1) Insurance Company Point of Contact; (2) Telephone number or web address used; (3) Description of current status and nay followup action(s) required; (4) Appropriate followup date based on conversation; (5) any carrier specific internal control numbers needed; and (6) action taken after contact. o	The Contractor may contact patients or patient representatives for the purpose of obtaining additional information that may be requested by the carrier, new insurance information, information releases or to seek assistance in completing documents being requested by the carrier.  All veteran contact will be in accordance with local requirements.  No patient or patient representative will be asked to provide any payment to the VA and at no time will any type of consumer collection activity take place.  If a carrier issues payment directly to a veteran and the carrier refuses to reissue payment directly to the VA, such claim(s) will be referred to Regional Counsel. o	Contractor will forward information on claims that require referral to a Regional Counsel for further collection activity.  Criteria for claims referral include: 1.	Litigation Issues - Refer bill if payment is denied because of VA related litigation. 2.	Veteran Not Responsible for Cost of Care - Refer bill if payment is denied because veteran is not required to pay VA for the care. 3.	Refusal to Pay Government Hospital - Refer bill if payment is denied because insurer is not required to pay a government hospital/facility. 4.	Veteran Paid Directly - Refer bill if payment is sent to the veteran instead of VA and veteran fails to respond to notification. 5.

A current list of services that are excluded from the e-MRA billing process will be provided to contracted staff from MCAC staff.  Cnotify the MCAC to resubmit the claim with a standard cover letter which explains why the claim should be processed without an MRA.  This notification should be completed on a daily basis. "	Contract AR staff will provide feedback to billing staff regarding specific billing-related issues.  Examples of these types of billing issues that may adversely impact collections and must be shared with billing staff are: payers not processing claims in accordance with the information provided on the MRA, payers refusing to process paper claims/must submit claims electronically, claim denials due to specific coding issues (i.e. a procedure is missing a modifier or has an invalid modifier according to a payer), etc. "	Unpaid insurance claims are not converted to self-pay status.  The veteran shall not be told he/she will become liable if the insurer fails to pay. Eligibility for VA care is not affected by insurance coverage.

"	Contractor agrees that all deliverables, associated working papers, and other material deemed relevant by the contractor in the performance of these tasks are the property of the United States Government.   "	Patient Confidentiality (HIPAA compliance) and overall data security are vitally important and will be maintained at all times.  All contract personnel shall be required to observe the requirements imposed on sensitive data by law, Federal regulations, and VA policies and procedures.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<ARCHDATE>04252008
<CONTACT>Pat Jackson, (817) 886-1054
<DESC>This request for proposal is a designed, full and open contract for construction.  The project is to implement fish and wildlife habitat restoration activities and construct recreational features along and within the river.  The project - The San Ant onio Channel Improvement Project (SACIP), Mission Reach Ecosystem Restoration and Recreation - is a four-phase multi-year channel reconstruction project. The project is to be constructed in a minimum of four phases, sequentially moving from upstream to dow nstream. Additionally, the project will serve to add cultural context and reinforce the connections between the four historic missions situated along this reach of the river.  This notice is in reference to the first phase of construction for the Mission R each.  Phase 1 begins at Lone Star Boulevard and continues downstream 1.2 miles to just below the San Antonio River confluence with San Pedro Creek.   This portion of the San Antonio River is currently maintained as a grass-lined, trapezoidal channel desig ned to convey peak storm discharges for the 100-year storm event.  Care of water consideration includes provisions for diverting river baseflow in order to reconstruct the pilot channel.  Base flow varies depending on spring flow, but it currently is in th e range of 150 cfs.  This high level of flow is expected to be the minimum flow throughout the coming spring and summer months.  Restoration and recreation features included in this phase of the project are: construction of a pilot channel, a thalwag, shee t pile weirs, rock riffle structures, embayments, slope stabilization using a reinforced soil slope system, an irrigation system, pedestrian trail, in-stream pedestrian footbridges (capable of carrying emergency equipment and becoming completely submerged during storm events), picnic tables, benches, trash receptacles, drinking fountains, and trail signage.  Sustainability of the restoration is enhanced through the use of channel slope and over-bank erosion protection and establishment of approximately 35-a cres of native riparian vegetation. Due to the unique restoration goal of the project, all measures taken to ensure the successful establishment of the proposed ecosystem, including invasive vegetation removal and control, sub-surface and surface soil prep aration, seed handling, and seeding operations, including proper controls for non-native plant contamination of equipment, are to be considered critical.   Included as an Option will be approximately 9600 linear feet of 36 inch diameter reinforced drilled piers in 7 locations along the phase 1 reach.  These piers would be installed at approximately midslope to remediate long-term slope stability issues.  The magnitude of the construction is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.  The RFP solicitation is antic ipated to be issued on or about 4 February 2008.  No public bid opening procedures are applicable to this solicitation.  A firm fixed price UNRESTRICTED contract is anticipated to be awarded using Best Value Evaluation criteria.  Anticipated award date i s 4 March 2008.  Anticipated completion date is September 2009.   FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, applies.  The successful offeror is required to perform at least 25 percent of the final cost of the contract, not including the cost of materia ls, with its own employees.  The 2002 North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 237990; SIC is 1629.  The Product Service Code is Y219.  The Small Business Size Standard is $31 Million.

DOI's Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD-Herndon) is a Federal Franchise Fund Contracting Office under the authority of the Government Management Reform Act and provides contracting support to all Federal civilian and DoD Agencies.  AQD-Herndon is seeking viable sources for the stated NWS requirements (as well as future requirements from NWS and other Federal Agencies) from all interested parties to provide approximately 400 VHF FM radio transmitters operating in the 162.400 to 162.550-MHz land mobile band.  It is anticipated that the initial contract awards as a result of this requirement may result in the award of multiple Five Year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to provide support to multiple locations in the United States and the U.S. territories Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands.  The initial transmitter requirement is intended to be deployed in the NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) Network. A detailed specification of the NWR transmitters is available by contacting the contact specialist at Alan Adrian@aqd.nbc.gov.  Prospective vendors are requested to submit documentation demonstrating their experience and technical capabilities. All written responses shall include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the requirements specified in the attachment. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirements. All companies shall provide their business size. If two or more small businesses are determined capable of meeting this requirement, the acquisition will be conducted as a small business set aside.

<DESC>CLINICAL ON LINE TRAINING COURSE 1. Are they only looking for "ready-made" content or are they interested in converting face-to-face content to an online environment?  THE VA IS EXPECTING TO RECEIVE READY-TO-TAKE COURSEWARE. IF THE CONTRACTOR HAS A FACE-TO-FACE CONTENT THEY CAN CONVERT TO ACCREDITED COURSEWARE AND CREATE IN VA FORMAT WE ARE FINE WITH THAT. 2. What are the top 10 programs they are looking for?  IN SECTION 2.1 OF THE STATEMENT OF WORK, WE STATED A NUMBER OF SUBJECT MATTER AREA WHICH ARE OF PRIME INTEREST.  3. What is the VA currently using as a LMS? How would the data get from our LMS to theirs?  PLATEAU. THE TRANSFER WOULD HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT BETWEEN VA TECHNICAL PROFESSIONALS AND THE WINNING BIDDERS TECHNICAL EXPERTS.  4. Will the VA work with the various accrediting bodies to ensure Medical CEU credit?  NO. THE STATEMENT OF WORK STATES WHO WE LIKE TO USE FOR OUR ACCREDITATION. WE EXPECT THE CONTRACTOR TO ENSURE ACCREDITATION OF THE COURSEWARE. 5. Could a proposer bid to provide courses in just one or two of the subject matter areas, such as EOCIC or BUSNS? NO.  52.212-1 ADDENDUM ON PAGE 22 OF THE SOLICITATION STATES THIS IS ALL OR NONE AWARD. 6. Within Para 1.1.1.1 and Para 1.3: "All revised courses shall be delivered for final review and acceptance by the VA within 63 calendar days of being notified of the requirement by the COTR."     "The time period shall begin when all the courses from a contractor have been received and accepted by the VA. If the VA exercises an option to renew the contract, the total number of licenses used by the VA will restart at zero at the beginning of each contract renewal period." Should that read: "The time period shall begin when each courses from a contractor have has been received and accepted by the VA." as each course is delivered separately, as required/requested by VA. It appears the 63 day clock for final review and acceptance does NOT start until after delivery and initial receipt and acceptance by VA (which may take several additional days). Is this a correct assumption? YES IT IS. THE CONTRACTOR WILL BE GIVEN 60 DAYS TO ACQUIRE THE COURSES, 30 DAYS AFTER ACQUIRING THE COURSES TO MODIFY TO VA STANDARDS AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE 60 DAYS TO APPROVAL.  THIS ONLY APPLIES TO THE BASE PERIOD. 7. Re: LMS/LCMS Hosting. Is VA's new internal LCMS up and running? Could the Offeror be expected to post to that LCMS as well as VCampus (for hosting by either)? May we assume that at least one or the other will be available for hosting? May we be assured that technical questions regarding either or both systems will be answered promptly? THE VA WILL HAVE AT LEAST ONE PLATFORM TO HOST THE COURSEWARE FROM. 8. Re: Subject Matter within courses / Accreditation of courses. It appears that no assistance or initial input will be forthcoming from VA Subject Matter Experts or VA Accreditation Program Personnel and that course curriculum and potential accreditation will be the sole responsibility of the Offeror, with only acceptance or rejection by VA "after the fact". Is this correct? In accordance with paragraph 1 (above), will the "requirement" notification be only that a course with a specific subject will be required (as long as it conforms to VA CPGs, Formularly, and technical requirements)? THE VA WILL NOT ASSIST ON THE INPUT OF THE COURSEWARE. WE HOPE THE CONTRACTOR WHO IS AWARDED THIS CONTRACT HAS THE SKILL TO ENSURE THIS COURSEWARE IS TECHNICALLY ACCURATE FOR THE SUBJECT MATTER DETAILED.  9. Re: 1.3 Period of Performance, and 2.1 Subject Matter. Will VA identify any of their preferred sources of the commercially available courses that could be used under this Solicitation? NO. THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PRESENTING THE COURSEWARE IS SOLELY ON THE CONTRACTOR.    10. Is there a VA preferred length for each course?  (i.e.: it takes 20 minutes, or 45 minutes to complete) THE VA WOULD HOPE THE COURSEWARE IS OF STRONG INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN METHOD, WITH DIFFERENT INSTRUCTION LENGTHS. THE COURSEWARE SHOULD HAVE SMALLER SECTIONS OF INSTRUCTIONS SO THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO TAKE A SECTION AND BOOKMARK AND COME BACK LATER AND TAKE ANOTHER SECTION, UNTIL THEY COMPLETE THE COURSEWARE. PERSONALLY, I TRY TO DEVELOP IN 15 MINUTES SECTIONS. THE COURSE LENGTHS SHOULD BE WHATEVER IT TAKES TO DEMONSTRATE THE SUBJECT.   11. Under this Solicitation, may previously Developed- for-VA/ESS-Use courses - either print-based or web-based, be used if final delivered product is 508, 6102, and SCORM compliant, and made available over (or through) VA preferred systems (i.e.: VCampus)? WE WILL ACCEPT A VERY MINIMUM NUMBER OF COURSEWARE THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED FOR THE VA THAT MIGHT NEED TO BE UP-DATED OR CONVERTED TO SCORM. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF BUYING COURSEWARE THEY HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED IN THE PAST.  12. Is the VA looking for a "off the shelf" type courseware or something custom to their needs? Typically we offer clients custom training solutions tailored to their needs. WE WANT READY-TO-TAKE COURSEWARE. WE ARE NOT OFFERING ANY ASSISTANCE IN THIS CUSTOM CREATION. THESE ARE CLINICAL COURSES DEVELOPED IN THE PAST FROM A NUMBER OF MEDICAL EDUCATIONAL INDUSTRIES.  13. Is the VA looking for a yearly course lease or to buy the training modules outright? We usually offer co-ownership of the end product. We fully understand that if the material is confidential that the client will have privacy rights. WE ARE LOOKING TO LEASE THIS COURSEWARE FOR 1 YEAR, WITH THE ABILITY TO RENEW FOR TWO OPTION YEARS.  14. Will the VA be supplying any of the content for the training modules (i.e. text, images, video, ect.)? Although we can create training modules from scratch we often leverage our client's current training material or a blend of both to help reduce the overall cost of the training initiative. THE VA IS NOT OFFERING ANY MATERIAL FOR THESE COURSES. 15. From past experiences we know that the VA has a large library of media content, would we have access to it? NO. 16. Will the VA provide learning objectives or an outline of what the course should include/cover? NO. 17. What is the projected audience for these courses? THESE ARE CLINICAL COURSES. THERE IS A NUMBER OF PROFESSIONAL CAREERS WITHIN THE CLINICAL REALM, SUCH AS MD, NURSES, SOCIAL WORKERS, ETC...  18. Are their limits to the number of VA projects/contracts that one company can be supplying at one time? We are currently working as a subcontractor for a VHA Online Training Initiative. NO. 19. Is their a required or preferred instructional design methodology for these training modules? THE PREFERENCE IS ADDIE MODEL 20. If medical illustrations are needed, does the VA require 2D or 3D illustrations? THE VA IS EXPECTING THE MOST PROFESSIONALLY CREATED COURSEWARE AVAILABLE. IF THAT COURSE DETAILS ILLUSTRATIONS IN 2D OR 3D TO ENHANCE THE CONTENT THEN WE ARE FINE WITH IT. WE SIMPLY WANT THE MOST PROFESSIONALLY DEVELOPED COURSES.  21. Do the courses require voiceover? THE COURSES NEED TO BE 508 COMPLIANT. 22. Is the vendor required to provide a course description for all of the listed courses in their proposal? YES 23. Will any accrediting agencies that is not listed on page 12 of the RFP need to be pre-approved by the VA? THE STATEMENT OF WORK STATES WHO WE LIKE TO USE FOR OUR ACCREDITATION. WE EXPECT THE CONTRACTOR TO ENSURE ACCREDITATION OF THE COURSEWARE. 24. The RFP mentions that all courses shall provide medical accreditation, does this include all of the courses or just the medically relevant courses? ALL COURSES ARE CLINICAL AND NEED ACCREDITATION. 25. Has the VA anticipated any revisions to the courses after the initial 63 day revision period? THE VA HAS NOT ANTICIPATED ANY REVISIONS. 26. Is their a set schedule of how the contract will be paid? WE ARE PAYING FOR COMPLETED COURSES. CONTRACTOR WILL BE AUTHORIZED TO INVOICE MONTHLY BASED UPON APPROVAL FROM THE COTR. Delivery/Implementation. If awarded the contract we would provided the VA with SCORM compliant training modules to be placed on the VA's LMS. The questions below are based on that scenario. 27. How would you like the learner to contact the Course Program Manager supplied by the vendor?  WE CAN WORK THIS OUT; EMAIL, PHONE, WE CAN SEE WHAT WILL BE THE BEST SOLUTION WITH HOW THE CONTRACTOR SETS UP THE DELIVERY. 28. By "support" is the VA referring to a Course Program Manager being available to answer course-based questions, IT question, content questions? ALL THE ABOVE. 29. If we were required to handle IT type issues/questions would we have access to the VA's LMS? If we were given access to the VA's LMS would we need to complete training or certification? YOU WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE VA'S LMS, HOWEVER WE WILL MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A DIRECT LINE TO OUR LMS IT PROFESSIONALS. 30. Is the VA looking to purchase all of the 185 courses listed or is this a master list of courses for the VA to choose from? If this is a list to choose from is their a projected number of courses that the VA will order? ALL THE COURSES MUST BE AVAILABLE AND THE VA WILL BE ALLOWED TO HAVE 30,000 STUDENT PER COURSE PER YEAR ATTEND.  31. If the courses are being ordered in stages or over a scheduled timeframe, how many will be ordered at once? Typically we offer our clients bulk discounts for ordering multiple courses. ALL THE COURSES SHOULD BE AVAILABLE AT THE SAME TIME.  32. If the courses are being ordered in stages or over a scheduled timeframe, will they all be order in the first year? Will any additional courses be order in the option years? THEY ARE NOT BEING ORDERED IN STAGES AND IF WE FEEL THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL COURSE IN OUT YEAR, WE WILL DISCUSS WITH OUR CONTRACTING OFFICER.  33. Will the VA like to receive the total number courses at once, or over a scheduled timeframe? AT ONCE 34. Is their a projected date that the contract will be awarded? PRIOR TO AWARD THE PROPOSED CONTRACT HAS TO GO THROUGH A BUSINESS CLEARANC REVIEW. 35. After the contract has been awarded to the vendor, how long will the vendor have to deliver the courses and supporting material (Phase I)? THE CONTRACTOR WILL BE GIVEN 60 DAYS TO ACQUIRE THE COURSES, 30 DAYS AFTER ACQUIRING THE COURSES TO MODIFY TO VA STANDARDS AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE 60 DAYS TO APPROVAL.  THIS ONLY APPLIES TO THE BASE PERIOD. 36. How many storyboards/courses can the VA handle at once for review? WE REALLY WANT TO GET COMPLETED COURSES, NOT STORYBOARDS. 37. How long has the VA given themselves for review and approval of storyboards/courses (Phase II)? WE REALLY WANT TO GET COMPLETED COURSES, NOT STORYBOARDS. 38. Once the VA has reviewed and approved the storyboards/courses what is the projected time before they would be posted live (Phase III)? WE REALLY WANT TO GET COMPLETED COURSES, NOT STORYBOARDS. 39. Is the VA open to different models/methodologies of reviewing and approving course content? We currently draft a detailed storyboard that acts as a blueprint of what will be built. Once the storyboard is complete it is sent to the client for review. Once the client has reviewed the storyboard and approved the content and instructional design the course is built. WE REALLY WANT TO GET COMPLETED COURSES, NOT STORYBOARDS. 40. What is the payment process for this project? We normally agree on milestones for payments. Down payment for order, payment for storyboard, etc. WE ARE NOT PAYING FOR DEVELOPMENT. WE ARE PAYING FOR COMPLETED COURSES. CONTRACTOR WILL BE AUTHORIZED TO INVOICE MONTHLY BASED UPON APPROVAL FROM THE COTR. 41. Re:  2.7 ASSESSMENTS/EVALUATIONS AND EXAMS "The contractor shall provide summary data 6 months from VA implementation of the courses and 10 months from implementation of the courses. The summary data shall include for each course: *	The numbers of persons that completed an assessment/evaluation for each course *	The numbers and percentages of the level that students thought they obtained for each learning objective of the course. *	The numbers and percentages of the level that students rated each faculty *	The numbers and percentages of the level students rated of each additional item included in the instrument. *	Any additional comments submitted by students." This information would be tracked by the VCAMPUS/VA LMS over which the Contractor has no control and so can't guarantee this information would be available. Since courses would be hosted directly on VA's LMS all student information is passed directly from the course to VA's LMS for tracking. Therefore, the LMS would track all completion, accreditation and assessment scores.  Would the contractor still need to get that information from the LMS and submit it back to VA? THIS INFORMATION IS REQUIRED FROM THE CONTRACTOR AND THEY GIVE THE VA A DETAIL REPORT. IF THE CONTRACTOR HOSTS THE DATA DIRECTLY ON THE VA LMS THEY SHOULD REQUEST THE REPORT INFORMATION FROM THE VA LMS EXPERTS. 42. Re: 2.9 VA DIRECTIVE 6102 COMPLIANCE. In many past web based training courses, 6102 was not applicable because it was considered a web application (course) and not a website. By applying 6102, the Contractor loses control of the interface as well as real estate for presenting the material. 6102 Best Practices identifies five attributes; Technical, Interface, Branding, Usability, Content. Strict adherence to Branding would, or certainly could use 25% or more of a page's real estate. Will these be considered web applications (courses) for the purpose of this contract and (assuming all other attributes are satisfied), be exempt from Branding? This would be done with the understanding that common graphics (VA Seals, and VA and/or EES logos), and agency title will be used, and used properly and otherwise in accordance with Directive 6102. CONTRACTOR MUST BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH VA DIRECTIVE 6102. 43. Levels of course interactivity are not specified. Will visuals, interactivities, audio, video be required for the courses? If so, what levels of interactivities are you looking for? WE DID NOT REQUIRE ANY DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR COURSE DEVELOPMENT. WE ARE ASKING FOR READY TO TAKE COURSES THAT ARE ACCREDITED AND PROFESSIONALLY DONE. WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE LEVEL OF INTERACTIVITY IS AT LEAST AT LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3.  44. Will there be any special or specific assessment requirements such as randomization of questions, answers, or specialized remediation back to content? AGAIN, THESE COURSES SHOULD ALREADY BE COMPLETED AND ASSESSMENT TOOLS SHOULD ALREADY BE DEVELOPED. AGAIN, WE ARE EXPECTING PROFESSIONALLY DEVELOPED COURSES. IF THE COURSES ARE DEVELOPED PROFESSIONALLY, THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE DEVELOPMENT PHASE. 45. On Page 37 of the RFP under Source Selection it states that the Government can:     c. Reject proposals that are evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in price/cost when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposals are deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program. Question - Can the Government provide either Rough Order of Magnitude Cost Estimate, or an Available Funds Estimate, or a Not To Exceed Estimate so that the Offers do not submit unrealistically high or low in price/cost when compared to Government estimates? THE GOVERNMENT HAS AN INDEPENDENT GOVERNMENT COST ESTIMATE AND NEVER REVEALS THAT INFORMATION TO OFFEROR'S. Otherwise we have no idea of how to begin to price an effort that is by the Governments own admission on page 8 (The courses listed will be ordered throughout the base period and each option period. The Government at this time does not know what courses are specifically needed during each year of the entire 3 year period.) likely to change from year to year. 46. On Page 36 of the RFP under PAST PERFORMANCE it states that   offerors shall provide two representative samples of previous work that are similar in scope and magnitude to the types of services anticipated for the contract. One fully developed web-based training sample shall demonstrate the offerors knowledge of and ability to work in technical settings. A brief statement outlining the purpose of the project and the intended audience should accompany each sample. Offerors shall submit sample instructional products and shall send the samples to the following address on or before the closing date and time for proposal receipt.     a. Question - Can the offerors submit all past performance information in a separate Past Performance Volume, or must it be included in the 25 page Technical Proposal Volume page count? PAST PERFORMANCE IS TO BE PROVIDED IN A SEPARATE VOLUME FROM THE TECHNICAL AND COST VOLUME'S.     b. Question - Do the offerors need to provide website login information to review the fully developed web-based training sample, or must we copy and paste webpages of the training sample into a separate document for review? What is the government's preferred medium to review the fully developed web-based training sample? 47. On page 34 of the RFP it states that Technical Proposals are limited to twenty-five pages, not including this document and not including the resumes.     Question - Does the 25 page limit include graphics, appendices, tables and figures, or can those be added to the 25 page limit? Does the 25 page limit include the past performance information? 25 PAGE LIMIT DOES NOT INCLUDE GRAPHICS, APPENDICES, TABLES AND FIGURES, BUT THE MAXIMUM PAGE LIMIT INCLUDING THESE IS 40 PAGES.  NO THE 25 PAGE LIMIT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION. 48. Is a CWBS required for the Cost Volume? NO 49. Is a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan required for the proposal submission, or is it only required after award of a contract? Can one be included as an appendix if the offeror so desires? ONLY REQUIRED WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER AWARD. NO DO NOT INCLUDE ONE AS AN APPENDIX. 50. On page 9 of the RFP it states the following:     1.1.1 CONTRACT IMPLEMENTATION. This contract shall be implemented in three phases: *	Phase 1: Award of contract and contractor revision of courses to meet SOW requirements and delivery to VA. *	Phase 2: Review of courses by the VA for compliance with contract requirements. *	Phase 3: VA acceptance of all courses and implementation of the courses for access by VA employees. This period of access to courses by students will occur for one year.     a. Question - Can the government provide an estimated timeline for each phase; i.e., how many months for each phase, and the anticipated milestone that will conclude each phase? Can the government provide more detail of their expectations for each phase? THE CONTRACTOR WILL BE GIVEN 60 DAYS TO ACQUIRE THE COURSES, 30 DAYS AFTER ACQUIRING THE COURSES TO MODIFY TO VA STANDARDS AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE 60 DAYS TO APPROVAL.  THIS ONLY APPLIES TO THE BASE PERIOD.     b. Question - Do the phases restart for each option year? NO, WE WILL ALREADY HAVE THE COURSES ON-LINE. ANY NEW COURSES WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE THREE PHASE SYSTEM.      c. Question - How does the statement found under paragraph 1.3 (All revised courses shall be delivered for final review and acceptance by the VA within 63 calendar days of being notified of the requirement by the COTR. The time period shall begin when all the courses from a contractor have been received and accepted by the VA.) relate to the 3 phase implementation described in paragraph 1.1.1? In other words, in what phase will the 63 day delivery time limit be imposed? THE CONTRACTOR WILL BE GIVEN 60 DAYS TO ACQUIRE THE COURSES, 30 DAYS AFTER ACQUIRING THE COURSES TO MODIFY TO VA STANDARDS AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE 60 DAYS TO APPROVAL.  THIS ONLY APPLIES TO THE BASE PERIOD.     d. It states under paragraph 1.3 that. "If the VA exercises an option to renew the contract, the total number of licenses used by the VA will restart at zero at the beginning of each contract renewal period."     Question - Does this apply to each Option Year? YES 51. Is the table found under 2.13 CONTENT AREAS AND THEIR TOPICS to be used to fill in the appropriate course description field on Appendix A form (page 22) for each course submitted by the offeror? THAT IS THE GUIDELINE TO PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION. 52. Are all of the courses listed in the SOW presently developed and in use by the VA? THERE WERE NO COURSES LISTED IN THE SOW. THE SOW LISTED CLINICAL SUBJECT MATTER ONLY. THE COURSES ARE BEING DELIVERED BY CONTRACTOR. 53. Are the courses presently being used by the VA the property of the VA or is the VA using commercial-off-the-shelf products? WE HAVE DEVELOPED OUR OWN COURSES AND WE HAVE PURCHASED COURSES ALSO. 54. Is the VA presently using a third party provider for clinical online training? If so, who? WE MIGHT HAVE A FEW COURSES FROM A THIRD PARTY; HOWEVER WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU TO DELIVERER NEW COURSES. I DO NOT FEEL THAT THE CONTRACTORS NEED TO KNOW WHO THE VA IS DEALING WITH NOW.  55. Will the contractor revise and/or develop new courses for the VA? THE CONTRACTOR NEEDS TO DELIVER THE MOST PROFESSIONAL COURSES FOR THE VA. HOWEVER WE ARE NOT REQUIRING IT DEVELOPMENT OF NEW COURSES. 56. How is the clinical online training for the VA being administered now? WE ARE IN A TRANSITION PERIOD AT THIS TIME FROM OUR OLD SYSTEM INTO OUR NEW LMS. 57. How many facilities does this RFP incorporate? NONE BECAUSE IT WILL BE HOSTED ON A WEB SITE. 58. The RFP notes VCampus as the enterprise wide LMS is there another platform/LMS under consideration by the VA for e-learning?  THE SOW STATES THAT THE COURSES WILL BE HOSTED INTO VCAMPUS OR SOME OTHER PLATFORM. WE DO HAVE A NEW LMS AND IT WILL DEPEND ON THE PROFESSIONALS AND TIMEFRAME AS TO WHERE WE HOST THESE COURSES. 59. Can we provide content with respect to approximated discipline needs within the response. (Example - approximately 75% of the staff are clinical - Internal Medicine would meet that needs but not be required by the general population.  The same with ACLS - probably needed by 60% of the population where BLS is needed by 75% or more) THE SOW STATES THAT EACH COURSE MUST ACCEPT UP TO 30,000 STUDENT PER YEAR, WITH THE VA'S OPTION TO RAISE THAT NUMBER WITH NEGOTIATION FROM THE CONTRACTING OFFICER AND THE CONTRACTOR.   60. What is the type of Contract, Fixed, Cost Plus, etc THIS IS A FIRM FIXED PRICE CONTRACT 61. The Work Statement discussed implementation of the contract in 3 Phases; does VA has an expectation of the length of time involved in each of the phases and/or maximum time. For example, the period of access to courses will occur for one year - we assume that is one year from the end of Phase 3 which would take the effort beyond 12 months from the beginning of the contract THE CONTRACTOR WILL BE GIVEN 60 DAYS TO ACQUIRE THE COURSES, 30 DAYS AFTER ACQUIRING THE COURSES TO MODIFY TO VA STANDARDS AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE 60 DAYS TO APPROVAL.  THIS ONLY APPLIES TO THE BASE PERIOD. 62. Each course title is listed as a separate CLIN. Instead of providing a price per course (per CLIN), can offerors bid one firm fixed price for all the courses we are bidding? YES 63. Do offerors need to include every course in the bid, or can offerors bid on less than 100% of the courses listed. NO.  52.212-1 ADDENDUM ON PAGE 22 OF THE SOLICITATION STATES THIS IS ALL OR NONE AWARD.

<DESC>Point of Contact: Michael R. Todd, Contracting Officer (425) 227-1179 Fax (425) 227- 1055 I.	Purpose: The purpose of the SIR is to seek competent and suitable sources for the subject project.  Responses to the SIR will be used to screen qualified companies. Screening information allows the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to determine which offerors are more likely to receive award, and ultimately, which offers will provide the FAA with the best value. The FAA has appointed an Integrated Product Team (IPT) which will evaluate each response received and make a selection of qualified offerors based on the evaluation criteria established in this SIR. The SIR evaluation process may involve face-to-face negotiations with one or more offerors. The intent of these negotiations is for the FAA evaluators, or IPT, to gain a better understanding of the proposed project and/or to clarify evaluation information submitted by the offeror. All offerors that are eliminated from the competition will be notified in writing. Written responses to this SIR are due by close of business 4:00 pm PST on  JANUARY 8, 2008. (NEW DATE IS NOW JANUARY 15, 2008 - 4:00 pm PST) II.	Scope of Project: This project renovates and upgrades systems in the first and second floors of the Administration Wing-North (Dining and E-W Conference Rooms) at the Salt Lake City ARTCC.  Work includes, but is not limited to, removal and replacement of existing interior finishes, mechanical systems (Fan Coil Units and wet-pipe fire alarm system), electrical systems (fire detection, lighting, power, LAN, telephone), miscellaneous demolition and construction of new office spaces, walls, and ceilings. All work must be coordinated in order to maintain an operational facility.  The total contract duration for completion of the work shall be 175 calendar days, excluding the following FAA holiday moratorium.  FAA Holiday Moratorium:  No work shall be scheduled or take place during the week of and preceding and following:  the Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Day Holidays.  Only emergency work to restore critical services to the facility will be considered, and moratorium waiver must be submitted and approved.  The moratorium period will not be counted against the contract construction duration for the project. The estimated contract price is from $250,000 to $500,000. The government contemplates award of a firm fixed price contract.  Offerors must be a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business (SEDB) certified with the U.S. Small Business Administration. The NAICS Code for this renovation project is 236210 and the Small Business Administration Size Standard is $31.0 Million. III.

One-on-one discussions may be held, at the option of the Government, with one or more offers, as determined necessary by the Contracting Officer, to clarify statements, resolve issues and omissions, etc. IV.	Availability of funds: Funding for the entire subject project is not available at this time.

6.  Can the GFE phone system be relocated if a contractor proposes another warehouse facility?  Yes

7.  Task 10.a ? Does the reference to 5000 calls per hour mean that the contractor will be handling a surge in calls (since the call center function is performed at FEMA by FEMA users ? Task 12.b ?

The contractor is responsible to answer all phone calls and  needs to be able to answer 5,000 calls per hour

8.  Please explain/clarify in TASK 12.b ? 2nd bullet ? ?Controlled Items Notification and Authorization System.?  I do not want to make an incorrect assumption about what this function is. Control items are those items that have a set limit per request established by the item?s control manager

9.  TASK 12.b ? Bullet 10 ? Is there currently an online Automated Ordering System or does this refer to an AOS that can be accessed via the internet?  I am unable to find online ordering capability for FEMA warehouse publications.  No there currently is not an online AOS. The new requirement is to have an online system

17. Please advise that if an 8(a) is teaming with a subcontractor; will the relevant experience of the subcontract be considered in the evaluation. Experience should be submitted from all team members and will be considered.  

18.  Should the lease and/or purchase cost for equipment be included as a separate line item in the contract (ie: order pickers; lifts; etc.) This is a fixed price contract and the contractor needs to consider cost of equipment in their price

19.  Will the Government and the contractor have concurrent/parallel telecom and data systems during the transition.  No.

20.  Does the Government have a contract in place for the transfer of telecom and data; or does the contractor need to address this and include cost under separate line item.  No.

The three chargers are for the forklifts while the rest of the equipment have batteries that only require to be  plugged in to be recharged

25.If the offer is to be performed by a team, a prime and a subcontractor, should Past Performance be included from both or only from the prime contractor??  Answer:  Yes. -- Did the answer mean from the team?  or from the prime? Experience should be submitted for all team members.

<DESC>Question # 1 - What is the maximum range of a single link? Government Response to Question # 1 - The maximum range and antenna gain of the system are classified.  A preliminary link analysis of the system has been conducted.  The link analysis was used to determine the RF sensitivity specified in the RFI. ?The DDL receiver shall be capable of receiving and decoding a signal with a Bit Error Rate (BER) of 10-6 when the RF input varies from 0 dBm to -95 dBm (assuming a nominal data rate of 500 kbps minimum) with an objective sensitivity of -102 dBm.? Question # 2 - How much power is available to the data link?   Government Response to Question # 2 - The total power available is 450 watts. (From the current WDL specification) This includes a higher power amplifier.  The power amplifier has not been determined but will likely be a class ?C? with 80-100 watts of output power.  A detailed power budget has not been performed.  (Power Amp 300 watts + interface cards 20 watts + Digital Link 130 watts) Question # 3 (2 Parts) - Concerning the requirement to maintain network connectivity in a radio silent mode, Question #3 (Part 1) - What is the definition of "radio silent mode"?   Government Response to Question # 3 (Part 1) The data link will have RF emissions of less than -80 dBm (Goal) in the ?radio silent? mode.  (From the current WDL specification standby mode)  While in the ?radio silent? mode the data link will be capable of receiving a valid RF signal that commands it into the active mode. The data link shall acquire network connectivity and output a valid signal within 10 seconds maximum after receiving this RF signal. Question # 3 (Part 2) - What is the required time duration for maintaining network connectivity in radio silent mode?   Government Response to Question # 3 (Part 2) Objective of 30 minutes. Question # 4 (2 Parts) - Concerning the requirement to support simultaneous connectivity between 10 node pairs in the same geographic area, Question # 4 (Part 1) - How do the node "pairs" relate to the CONOPS?   Government Response to Question # 4 (Part 1) - The CONOPS is for a minimum of 10 Data Link Pods controlling 10 Weapons in the same geographic area on a non-interference basis.  Each pod-weapon combination will be considered a node pair and require a minimum bit rate of 500 kbps.  Ten node pairs may require 10 independent full data rate channels. Question # 4 (Part 2) - If a full mesh network is considered, is the maximum number of nodes in the network 10 or 20?  Government Response to Question # 4 (Part 2) - The minimum number of nodes is 20. Question # 5 - Acquisition Strategy - how does this RFI/Technology survey fit into a notional acquisition strategy?  What are you going to do with the data you receive?  Will there be a down select as a result of this RFI?  Do you envision a future RFP? If so when might that occur? Government Response to Question # 5 - We are surveying industry to determine the existing state of digital data links.  After a thorough review of the responses, additional information and potentially demonstration hardware may be requested from some if not all of the respondents.  A future RFP is possible, with the timeframe in the next 1-2 years. Question # 6 - The RFI refers to RF DDL RF Retrofit. Is this program not exploring new waveforms for the SLAM-ER WDL?   Government Response to Question # 6 - New waveforms will be considered. Question # 7 - If the DDL does reflect a SLAM-ER growth option, are you considering the forward (Command) link to be a minimum of 500 KB/s also? Government Response to Question # 7 - 500 kbps minimum is desired for bi-directional communication. Question # 8 - If this request is related to potential SLAM ER applications, why the apparent emphasis on network communications when the existing, proven CONOPS is for point to point communication pairs? Government Response to Question # 8 - Investigation of growth potential.

<SUBJECT>A -- Facilities of Research Excellence (FORE) in Spinal Cord Injruy (SCI) - Training Program
<SOLNBR>NIH-NINDS-08-01
<RESPDATE>030708
<ARCHDATE>03222008
<CONTACT>Laurie Leonard, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 496-1813, Fax 301 402-4225, Email ll44s@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is considering to support the development and implementation of a training program in Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) research methodologies that will emphasize hands-on experience, at a site to be designated as a NINDS ?Facility of Research Excellence in Spinal Cord Injury.?  

The NINDS is the lead NIH Institute for funding of SCI research, and the major supporter of basic science to develop novel therapeutic strategies for this disorder.  In the United States, the incidence of SCI is approximately 11,000 per year.  Over the past three decades, academic researchers have developed and increasingly utilized standardized techniques designed to model human SCI in the rodent.  These include contusion, compression and partial or complete transection, and most have targeted thoracic spinal segments.  Several new models have been developed in recent years including mouse SCI and cervical injuries in both rat and mouse.  It is a great challenge for researchers new to the field to learn these procedures based solely on the literature.  It is difficult to learn to use these standard animal models of SCI with precision and to develop the expertise and facilities to adequately maintain and assess the animals after surgery.

SCI at different levels of the spinal cord result in a range of functional deficits in motor, sensory and autonomic functions.  A crucial element in conducting SCI research is to have the ability to evaluate the return of behavior and function in a careful and meaningful manner.  Behavioral measures of motor and sensory function have been developed, including the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) open-field locomotor score, and more recently, the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS).  These metrics were developed to be sensitive to a range of injury severities, and are now used widely to assess novel therapeutic strategies, in conjunction with anatomical and physiological assessments.  New investigators require instruction and practice in the performance and use of these procedures in order to interpret their results accurately and reproducibly.  In addition, a number of other functional measures of forelimb and autonomic and sexual functions have been introduced recently, as well as training modalities and robotic devices designed to model rehabilitative therapies and monitor recovery.  Several of these measures were developed in previously awarded Facilities of Research Excellence in Spinal Cord Injury (FORE-SCI) facilities and, as yet, have not been used extensively by other laboratories. 

A significant number of potential therapeutic approaches to protect and repair the injured spinal cord have been identified, but few of these have reached the stage of clinical trials and none have been successfully translated into clinical practice.  Among several key factors limiting successful translation, the quality and reproducibility of the reported results is one that can be directly addressed by training opportunities for investigators and trainees in laboratories undertaking SCI research.  Based on a series of workshops, NINDS identified several unmet needs in the field of SCI and issued a Broad Agency Announcement in 2002 to develop contracts for FORE-SCI for training in SCI research methods, replication studies, and development of improved outcome assessments.  To date, the FORE-SCI hands-on course has been run at a single site, for three continuous weeks annually, accommodating 16 students per year.  A report published in 2005 by the Institute of Medicine emphasized the need for continuing instructional and collaborative opportunities in SCI research, specifically citing the training supported by the NINDS contract.  The NINDS now seeks to re-compete this effort by soliciting proposals for a program to teach standard SCI research techniques and to provide opportunities for hands-on experience with these techniques.  

This solicitation is for development and implementation of a training program in SCI research methodologies that will emphasize hands-on experience, at a site to be designated as a NINDS ?Facility of Research Excellence in Spinal Cord Injury.?  Its purpose is to provide short-term intensive training for researchers new to SCI research on the best practices in the field, including the standards of current research methodology, analytical procedures and functional outcome evaluations.  The FORE-SCI Contractor shall provide resources, capabilities and expertise in SCI research and the ability to work with multiple standard rodent models of injury.  The Contractor shall provide facilities and personnel for expert handling, care and medical management of animals with SCI, and FORE-SCI participants will become expert the ethical conduct of experiments in SCI and associated animal care.  The site will provide dedicated facilities and expertise for conducting surgery, including microsurgery such as transplants and grafts, and for cellular analyses ranging from neuroanatomy and histology to electrophysiology and other cutting-edge technologies.  This FORE-SCI program will provide training for participants, from graduate student to faculty level, to promote consistency of procedures and practices across laboratories.  

It is anticipated that this annual training program will yield a well-trained cadre of researchers dedicated to advancing research to relieve the burden of SCI.  A successful program will prepare FORE-SCI participants to return to their organizations/institutions with the ability to perform rigorous experimental programs of the highest quality, and to disseminate the techniques they have learned to others in their laboratories.  

Specific performance goals of this Contract are:

<SUBJECT>A -- Facilities of Research Excellence (FORE) in Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) - Replication Studies
<SOLNBR>NIH-NINDS-08-02
<RESPDATE>030708
<ARCHDATE>03222008
<CONTACT>Laurie Leonard, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 496-1813, Fax 301 402-4225, Email ll44s@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is considering issuing contracts to identify two NINDS ?Facility of Research Excellence in Spinal Cord Injury? (FORE-SCI) sites to conduct research to replicate promising studies that could lead to new and effective treatments for spinal cord injury (SCI).

The NINDS is the lead NIH Institute for funding of SCI research, and the major supporter of basic science to develop novel therapeutic strategies for this disorder.  In the United States, the incidence of SCI is approximately 11,000 per year.  In recent years, many laboratories have reported anatomical and behavioral indications that spinal cord tissue can be preserved and/or spinal circuitry regenerated in animal SCI models.  These novel findings have led to the expectation that these strategies could be translated into effective clinical treatments for SCI.  While there remains some question as to how much and what type of preclinical data will predict success in clinical trials, there is agreement that proof of principle experiments should be replicated independently in multiple laboratories and/or in more than one type of animal model.  To date, a significant barrier to the development of promising avenues to treatments for patients is the lack of independent confirmation of preclinical results.  This inability to confirm and characterize potentially important outcomes with confidence has prevented new approaches from moving forward to clinical studies.

Thus, a significant number of potential therapeutic approaches to protect and repair the injured spinal cord have been identified, but few of these have reached the stage of clinical trials and none have been successfully translated into clinical practice.  Among several key factors limiting successful translation, assessing the quality and reproducibility of the reported results is one that can be directly addressed by attempting to replicate and confirm promising studies independently.  Based on a series of workshops, NINDS identified several unmet needs in the field of SCI and issued a Broad Agency Announcement in 2002 to develop contracts for FORE-SCI for training in SCI research methods, replication studies, and development of improved outcome assessments.  To date, two FORE-SCI contracts have supported attempts to replicate published preclinical studies that show promise for development into new treatments for SCI.  Unfortunately and unexpectedly, none of these attempts have succeeded in confirming the functional gains reported in the original studies.  A report published in 2005 by the Institute of Medicine emphasized the continuing need for replication of preclinical studies, naming this as one of six criteria for drug therapies entering clinical trials.  This report also states that ?an emphasis on the replication of preclinical studies (replication studies) between laboratories is needed,? citing the FORE-SCI centers as prototypes for this effort.  Further, it suggests that the effort also include ?broader studies that not only replicate a previous study but also include novel elements in the experiment.?  The NINDS now seeks to re-compete this effort by soliciting proposals for two centers to undertake replication studies to confirm exciting findings from the spinal cord injury field.

GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE CONTRACT:

The proposed solicitation is to identify two NINDS ?Facility of Research Excellence in Spinal Cord Injury? (FORE-SCI) sites to conduct research to replicate promising studies that could lead to new and effective treatments for SCI.  The role of these two FORE-SCI centers will be to review and replicate novel treatments for SCI and to compare the efficacy of different treatments in a standardized environment with a minimum of variability in surgery, animal care, outcome evaluation and cellular analyses.  It is anticipated that these centers will replicate at least one study per year, and make the results of these studies readily available to the SCI research community through peer-reviewed publications, presentations and other appropriate venues.  A successful program will demonstrate the capability to utilize multiple models of rodent spinal cord injuries, outcome measures and other experimental protocols to be used in the studies selected for replication.

SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE GOALS OF THIS CONTRACT ARE:

1. To assess the scientific literature to select and then attempt to replicate promising, published preclinical studies of therapies that could lead to effective treatments for human SCI;
2. To compare the efficacy of different treatments in a standardized environment with a minimum of variability in surgery, animal care, outcome evaluation and cellular analyses; and
3. To promptly report the methodology and results of the replication study to the research community.

It is anticipated that two cost-reimbursement type contracts will be made for a period of five (5) years in September 2008.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. NIH-NINDS-08-02 will be available electronically and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov) or through the NINDS website at the following URL address: (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/currentrfps.htm) 15 or more calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis.

<SOLNBR>USM-RFI-08-002
<RESPDATE>013108
<ARCHDATE>01092009
<CONTACT>Damon Wamsley, Contracting Officer, Phone 304 480-7150, Fax null, Email psb2@bpd.treas.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to answer questions submitted, to date, with regards to this RFI.  Additional questions may still be submitted by the date listed in Section 6.0 of the original RFI.  

Question # 1:
Is Integrated Retail Information System (IRIS) ? Fulfillment and Call Center Operations, a new requirement?  If not a new requirement, please provide pertinent information regarding the incumbent Contract/Contractor?  

Answer # 1:
While this is not a new requirement, the original requirement is being split into two separate parts.  This RFI only includes the Call and Fulfillment Center Section and excludes the IT related portions of the existing contract.  With that being said, the existing Contractor is Accenture, LLP and they are operating under Contract TM-HQ-05-0001.

Question # 2:
What is the anticipated award date for this procurement?

Answer # 2:
The anticipated date of award will be sometime prior to July 14, 2008 depending on the time it takes to complete the procurement process.  

Question # 3:
The FBO (FedBizOpps) notice indicated that the place of performance is Washington, DC (Zip Code 20220).  Would the Government consider fulfillment operations at a location outside of the Washington, DC area?

Answer # 3:
The current Call and Fulfillment Operations are located in Plano, TX and Memphis, TN.  As such, the Government will consider any location within the United States, as long as that site provides the greatest value to the United States Mint, while meeting the tight security requirements set forth by the United States Mint?s police force. 

Question # 4:
Can the Government advise on the approximate warehouse space (square feet) currently utilized to support the current operations?

Answer # 4:
The current fulfillment center has 450,000 square feet footprint augmented by a multi-level mezzanine to increase the effective workspace to over 1,000,000 square feet.

Question # 5:
Will transportation costs for outbound shipments be borne by the Contractor?

Answer # 5:
The current contract includes an escrow account for postage managed by the contractor.  In addition, the Mint pays  transportation costs directly for a secondary provider.  However, the exact method for the future contract has not yet been determined.

Question # 6:
Will this procurement be competed commercially?

Answer # 6:
Competition will be limited to an established source list created as a result of market research.

 
Question # 7:
What is the potential value of this procurement?

Answer # 7:
The value of this procurement is dependent upon the awarded contractor?s pricing.  The contractor providing the best overall value to the United States Mint will ultimately drive the contract price.  Be advised that Government estimates are procurement sensitive as this information could skew pricing submitted by solicited vendors.

Question # 8:
What is the contract cycle?

Answer # 8:
This is an ongoing requirement that will remain in effect for multiple years not to exceed five (5) years. The period of performance is dependant upon the actual award date, thus the exact period of performance will not be established until that time.  

Question # 9:
Can you please provide a list of numismatic products that this contract will entail?

Answer # 9:
No, the actual products vary at any one time, based on new product launches, inventory sell-out, etc.  The current list of products is not eligible for release at this time.  However, for purposes of identifying a vendor's capability, please note that there are approximately 1,300 SKUs currently stored at the fulfillment center.

<SOLNBR>N6554008SCAM1
<RESPDATE>020508
<CONTACT>Scott Petersen, Code 23, scott.m.petersen@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, Detachment Norfolk ( Code 23- Combatant Division) is requesting information regarding processes to harden water jet impeller blades to increase their resistance to impact damage from stones and other miscellaneous intake debris.  The US Navy operates small combatant craft designed to transport troops along inland waterways and deploy them along unimproved shorelines.  This requires operating the craft in very shallow waters where contact with bottom debris can not be avoided.  The craft employ commercially manufactured twin water jet propulsors.  Operations of the craft in shallow water have shortened the life of the stainless steel impellers as a result of increased debris flow past the impeller.  Sand and small rocks wear away the impeller over time and decrease the efficiency of the impeller as a result.  Wear of the impeller blades is the leading maintenance item affecting craft availability.  Lengthening wear l!  ife would allow reduction in spares inventory and Mean Time to Repair.  In order to prolong the life of the impellers and decrease the maintenance demands, it is proposed to investigate methods to avoid debris impact events, to improve the erosion resistance of the stainless steel blades, or to investigate alternative design approaches to increase the operational life of the blades.  It is requested that companies submit their proposals for solution approaches, including amplifying information related to past experience, applicable product or process brochures, complete technical specification/data sheets, and any independent assessment results currently available.  Responses should be emailed to Scott Petersen at scott.m.petersen@navy.mil.  Responses should be received no lated then 5 FEB 2008.  This sources of sought announcement does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a!   commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitati on or ultimately award a contract.  The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs inncurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.

1.0	Background and Information
The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS) is the largest public real estate organization in the country and a provider of workspace and workplace solutions to more than 100 federal agencies representing over a million federal civilian workers in 2,000 communities. This comprises over 1,600 Government-owned buildings, or approximately 55 percent of GSA's total inventory. The remaining 45 percent is in privately owned leased facilities. All PBS assets are deployed in two fundamental activities.

The first activity is space acquisition through new construction or leasing. This is a project management activity that translates customer agency's space needs into discrete requirements, marshals the resources necessary to fulfill the requirements and manages the execution of the project, resulting in the delivery of workspace.

The second activity is the life cycle asset management of the acquired space. This includes the physical supervision of the buildings in the portfolio, fulfillment of contractual obligations to our customer agencies, ensuring continuation of operations cycle-asset management of the acquired space, ensuring continuity of operations, determining prudent investment in maintaining a property and ultimately, when and by what means an asset will be disposed of at the end of its useful life.

<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards AFB, California is conducting market research and seeking sources for  continuation of systems engineering test support for the 418th Flight Test Squadron for the execution and sustainment of the C-5 Avionics  Reliability Enhancement and Re-engine Program (RERP). 

C-5 modernization encompasses the Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program (RERP) denoted C-5 AMP/RERP. The full modernization effort incorporates a ?glass cockpit? with digital avionics, a new aircraft propulsion system, and reliability improvements. Modified commercial engines, nacelles, thrust reversers, and pylons will be integrated into the legacy C-5 airframe. The anticipated performance improvements are intended to optimize cargo carrying capabilities, to include fully loaded take-offs and landings on relatively short runways, and to meet the performance requirements of the Global Air Traffic Management initiative. Additionally, the re-engining is intended to provide significant reliability, maintainability, and availability improvements. A commercial engine support concept (including two levels of maintenance and warranties) will be integrated into the C-5 logistics support system infrastructure. Candidate subsystems for reliability enhancement include the flight control, hydraulics, environmental control, electrical, and fuel systems. 

Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing including your company name, address, telephone number, point of contact with e-mail address, business size, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS), Central Contractor Registration (CCR) number, Federal Cage Code, general description of the company with proven ability to meet requirements, and a description of similar contract, to include agency name, contract number, dollar magnitude, performance period, and point of contact with telephone number to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 11, 2008.

Reporting of maintenance related problems shall be via a contractor?s toll free number, which is available 24 hours a day, seven (7) days a week.  

Maintenance shall include travel, mileage, parts, materials and labor. The contractor is required to attend monthly technical meetings at the SSA?s Headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland to discuss on-going matters of importance and concerns relative to the telephone maintenance contract, if requested, and to participate from the contractor?s remote site in any telephone conference call with SSA staff and SSA Regional staff to discuss matters of mutual importance regarding the telephone maintenance contract.  

SSA is attaching a draft Statement of Work.  This SOW will use vendor response to assist in fine tuning and finalizing the maintenance SOW to be posted, listing the requirements requested by the government.   The vendor will be required to provide maintenance and on-going support services for existing telephone system expansions, relocations, move-add-change request, perennial time changes, various system reports and on-site or remote reprogramming changes to the systems on an as needed basis.

Additionally, the interested vendor shall be required to provide availability and access for the purchase and installation of approximately 500 telephone systems to the SSA during the life of the contract.  Additional system installation services, as required, for the term of the contract may also be provided. The SSA will guarantee installation of 45 of these new systems in the first contract year, of which the new systems are expected to be installed immediately and managed as a project by the vendor.  SSA plans to purchase an additional 55 telephone systems over the life of the project, with an option to purchase and install up to an additional 455 telephone systems at the discretion of the government.  These telephone systems will be basic telephone systems with no enhanced features (see attached draft maintenance contract with telephone system replacement section).  After the warranty period, the telephone systems will be added to the maintenance contract and maintained by the vendor.  The contract will be available for one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option. 

At the request of the SSA, the replacement systems provided by the vendor will:
-	Be capable of growth
-	May require station moves
-	May be de-installed and removed 
-	Have services related to the installation of modular/systems furniture, 
-	May require changes to the up-front and queue greetings, 
-	May require general telephone system reprogramming,
-	May require reprogramming of maintenance modems. 

SSA is initiating the Telephone Systems Replacement Project (TSRP) to replace all of the SSA owned telephone systems over the next 4-5 years.  The number of telephone systems maintained will decrease with the implementation and installation of TSRP. The new TSRP will be installing new Telephone systems, replacing the aging legacy systems.  As these systems are replaced, they will be removed from this maintenance contract, causing a gradual decrease in the quantity of systems being maintained during this 4-5 year period.  The TSRP vendor will be responsible for the removal and disposal of the de-installed legacy telephone systems.  The government will notify the vendor of the specific offices as installation dates are scheduled, with at least 30 days prior notice.  These offices will be removed from the maintenance contract, via an email from the COTR on a monthly basis throughout the replacement.  When systems are replaced by a vendor, other than the TSRP vendor (i.e. the maintenance vendor?s installs), SSA may instruct the vendor to recover the old telephone system parts to assist in maintaining the current telephone systems.

Vendors responding to this Request for Information (RFI) should be made aware that this is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or Request for Proposal.  This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government and responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by SSA to form a binding contract.  SSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or pay for any information provided as a result of this RFI.  SSA will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with any RFI submissions or follow up information that is requested.

SSA is requesting the following:

1)	Vendor capabilities to provide parts and technical expertise to support the aging systems or alternative process to maintain systems.
2)	Proposed business processes to perform maintenance in these offices located throughout the Continental U.S., Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and Alaska.
3)	Trouble Reporting processes and capabilities
4)	Suggestions for improvements on existing Draft SOW.
5)	Responses for partial capabilities, if submitting vendor cannot support all three manufacturer types.  
Information received will be considered solely to make informed decisions regarding a potential procurement. Interested sources that believe they have the ability to perform the services required should submit a detailed statement of their capabilities in writing to Michele Tubman, Contract Specialist, via email at michele.tubman@ssa.gov. Please reference SSA-RFI-MT001 in the e-mail subject line.  Responses must be received by 3:00 p.m. EST on January 24,2008.

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to request white papers for scheduling algorithms for next generation Electronic Warfare (EW) systems.  Responses to this RFI will be reviewed by the Government and may result in an invitation to submit proposals a gainst a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for a 2QFY08 award.  Award is not guaranteed and the Government does not intend to pay for information received.    <BR><BR>The goal of the next generation EW system is to simultaneously manage the Electronic Suppor t (ES) and Electronic Attack (EA) capabilities.  This system shall dynamically detect the addition of new hardware and manage the necessary resources and resource chains to ensure the hardware is utilized effectively for ES and EA purposes.   This system w ill have to prioritize, select, and apply ES/EA techniques for multiple disparate technologies, simultaneously.  This system will contain multiple diverse Signals of Interest (SOI) across multiple technology types and the underlying scheduling algorithms w ill need to coordinate ES and EA dynamically as new emitters are discovered.  These aforementioned techniques are surgical in nature with a goal of minimizing transmit time, minimizing transmit power, and maximizing system effectiveness.  These types of at tacks allow the system the flexibility to go off and accomplish other tasks.  <BR><BR>Given a specific set of resources, algorithms needs to be developed that can accept these surgical algorithms and schedule them to best utilize the set of available resou rces. Multiple disparate signals are being simultaneously scanned for and detected and if determined to be a threat, these signals will need to be attacked in accordance with the mission parameters.<BR><BR>The following assumptions can be made for the purp oses of the white paper.<BR>1.	The system will consist of hardware(s) that is open and software definable<BR>2.	The system will be aware of all available resources at startup but added hardware will need to be detected and managed<BR>3.	Priority level of t arget technologies and threats are given as part of the mission parameters but need to be managed as part of the scheduler<BR>4.	The following parameters are known for the ES/EA techniques<BR>a.	Tx Duration<BR>b.	Tx Power<BR>c.	Reaction Time<BR>d.	Revisit Time<BR>e.	Frequency<BR>f.	Modulation<BR>g.	Etc.<BR><BR>This white paper should include a Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate to develop, implement, and prototype the algorithms.  <BR><BR>Responses to this RFI are to be received no later than 29 Febr uary 2008.  Information is preferred in soft-copy form in either Microsoft? Word? and/or Microsoft PowerPoint?.  If a soft-copy cannot be provided, written information will be accepted.

The system shall also  support the Army logistics transformation initiatives such as GCSSA, CLOE, Net  centricity, and improve diagnostics by supporting Smart TPS development.  The  system must consolidate the capabilities and mission requirements of all  current army ATS into one test system. It will replace the Direct Support  Electrical System Test Set (DSESTS), IFTE BSTF (V) 3, and IFTE BSTF (V) 5.   The system will support the existing TPS hardware and software each of the  aforementioned testers without modification to the existing TPS hardware.   Initially the system should possess all of the technical test capability of  the DSESTS, BSTF (V) 3 and EOTF less electro-optics however it should be  readily upgradeable to EO test capability by simple integration of an Electro- Optics subsystem. The NGATS shall implement the Joint Service DoD NxTest Open  Architecture, be NetCentric compatible, and compliant with the DoD Common Test  Interface (CTI). The system shall use an open architecture and VXI  instrumentation while consisting of Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products  where availably and cost effective. The system shall permit rapid  reconfiguration and flexibility along with easy replacement of instruments as  they become obsolete. This system shall be compliant with current IFTE and  DSESTS ATLAS to increase backward compatibility with currently developed Test  Program Sets (TPS) and current industry standard commercially available TPS  development software packages.  National Instruments Test Stand for future TPS  development. The tactical configuration of the system shall be designed to be  housed and operated the standard ISO 20 form factor without modifications  which interfere with loading and handling by current standard commercial and  military container handling equipment.

<DESC>A.	 General Information<BR><BR>The Pacific Region-TRBO Region 12, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment facilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Requ est for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Exam Table Paper. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents t he clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program <BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Na val Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Ve ndor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For ad ditional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with  three 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is December 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered signific antly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will be come more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is a nticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availab ility. <BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Susan Hwang, TRBO Team Leader<BR>(808) 433-3686, susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Pacific Region is seeking product line items, in the category of Exam Table Paper, which at  a minimum includes the high volume lines below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $ 67,199.00. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. The top high volume u sage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below. <BR><BR>At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brand s, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name an d Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received by 4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline w ill be disqualified from participating. <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples f or clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC that their initial submission, q uotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military T reatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative. <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered- pricing discounts off of the Vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is deter mined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I: Technical/Company Evaluation Process <BR><BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company cr iteria from each vendor.<BR>Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. <BR> All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine t he acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of techn ical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate: (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumable; (2) based on the vendor s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such product or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be di squalified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and, (6) the vendors information provided is factually  correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Vendor must manufacture and/or distri bute a complete product line of Exam Table Paper. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage it ems are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, the following items are required: <BR><BR>"	18 x 125 in a crepe grade paper<BR>" 	21 x 225/230 in a crepe grade paper<BR>"	18 x 125 in an smooth grade paper<BR>"	21 x 225/230 in an smooth grade paper<BR><BR>Provide certification of all brands of this product line that you manufacturer or distribute with the initial submittal.<BR> 2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Exam Table Paper product line. Provided the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or sh ow a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the regional prime vendor Cardinal Health for distribution in this Region and provide certification of this with the initial submittal. (Note  that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified). <BR>4.	Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders ar e required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount of DAPA. (Note that vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>5.	Vendor must provide customer  service (telephonic and e-mail) for regional facilities. Identify company resources and capabilities for such support with the initial submittal.<BR>6.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region. Provide contact information, i .e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with the initial submittal.<BR>7.	Vendors product line must be latex free and indicated on the packaging and in the product literature. <BR><BR>Phase II: Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process<BR><BR>Th e multi-disciplinary TPRB clinical team will request samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will b e allowed 21 calendar days   from the date of notification to complete the delivery. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the 21st calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.<BR><BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert type scale, with a one to five rating. One (1) = Strongly Disagree, Two (2) = D isagree, Three (3) = Neutral, Four (4) = Agree, and Five (5) = Strongly Agree. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. <BR><BR>To determine acceptability, the TPRB clinical team, comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines,  will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. The TPRB clinical team intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical setting; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluation in either a non-clinical o r clinical setting or both.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Product unrolls easily (roll moves smoothly in cradle and edges do not fray upon dispensing).<BR> 2.	Product tears easily and evenly when removing soiled paper (paper does not bunch up or shred when removing soiled section).<BR>3.	Product protects table from moisture (maintains barrier and does not leak emesis, diarrhea, medications, irrigations, or dr essing change solutions)<BR><BR>Phase III: Pricing Analysis Process<BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in t he clinical evaluation group will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirements. Vendors will be provided seven (7) calendar days to submit t heir price quotes in a prescribed format via email. Price quotes must be received by 4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the 7th calendar day. Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will  result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/participation. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s) without discussion as noted above. However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussion and re quest revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. <BR>As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more importa nt. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing an alysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (3) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor. SKU review will assess the number of line items a vendor is able to supply to  the MTFs versus the number of currently used line items.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

incorporated entity; or

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
