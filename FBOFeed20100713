<a href="mailto:m.hudson-murray.ctr@randolph.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>ELGS/PNK formally announces the intent to award a sole source task order FA8734-10-F-0012 Government & Retirement Benefits, Inc. (GRB), under GSA contract GS34F-0047S Schedule 70 for approximately $9.5K.  To meet mission requirements, the objective of this acquisition is for the subscription of software for the Employee Benefits Information System (EBIS) for WebAssist licenses. Support requires the continuation (renewal) of the current WebAssist EBIS license for approximately 103 users. This license will allow the Benefits and Entitlements Service Team (BEST) counselors to continue to use this automated tool enabling the BEST to provide timely and accurate retirement estimates, deposit and redeposit calculations. By July 2010, BEST counselors will be providing retirement estimates, deposit, and redeposit calculations for approximately an additional 5,000 AF civilians. By July 2011, that number will increase to another 38,000 when BEST will be providing these services t! o all AF civilian employees. Justification for this follow-on contract is FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  These services are deemed to be available only from the original source for the continued provision of highly specialized services. The software product subscription and data rights are solely owned and cannot be purchased. The period of time required to perform a source selection as well as the ramp-up time required for a new contractor to customize software to meet the requirements would cause an unacceptable schedule delay and a substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The period of performance is five months to begin on 01 August 2010 through 31 December 2010. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all interested persons that identify to the contracting officer their intent ! and capabilities to satisfy the government's requirement with commercial services items and are received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract actions based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service or the manufacturer meets qualifications requirements at time of award, in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1 or 52.209-2.  An ESC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offers, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  Before consulting the ombudsman concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. In addition AFFARS 5352.201-9101, O! MBUDSMAN, will be included in this acquisition's solicitation and contract.  The ESC OMBUDSMAN is the ESC director, Commander's staff, and can be contacted at: ESC/DC Bldg 1606 9 Eglin Street, Hanscom AFB MA 01731 Telephone 781-1377-5106 Facsimile 781-377-4569 E-Mail: esc.ombudsman@handsom.af.mil.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION<BR>This is a request for information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  Responses to this notice shall not be construed as offers and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.  The U.S. government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partys expense.  Not responding to this RFI will not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued.  The release of Product ManagerForce Protection Systems (PM-FPS) documentation is limited to United States corporations and United States citizens.  The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the government to solicit for or award a competitive contract.<BR>PROGRAM BACKGROUND<BR>The Product ManagerForce Protection Systems (PM-FPS), under the Joint Program Manager Guardian and Joint Program Executive Officer for Chemical and Biological Defense, provides affordable, modular, scalable and supportable tactical force protection capabilities to forward deployed forces while simultaneously providing state of the art physical security equipment to Army installations worldwide.  In execution of this responsibility PM-FPS is seeking to leverage recent experiments and technology demonstrations to establish the Integrated Ground Security, Surveillance and Response Capability (IGSSR-C) program to produce uncluttered, accurate, and actionable, near real time (NRT) status and warnings for display on a Common Operational Picture (COP).<BR>Historically, equipment and systems procured for physical security of military installations have operated independently, requiring numerous operators to monitor the situation.  The lack of a common environment and integrated display also inhibits the full potential of wide area surveillance with overlapping sensor coverage, especially in high-threat environments.  Technology risk reduction in systems integration, data fusion, and automation have demonstrated the feasibility of producing a system that allows operators to focus more on responding to threats and less on equipment and data management.<BR>REQUIREMENTS SCOPE<BR>The United States Army Research Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), on behalf of PM-FPS, is seeking qualified business candidates, capable of building a security system that provides data fusion capability, automates selected functions, integrates advanced sensors using standard schema, and interfaces with legacy sensors and other existing force protection equipment.  A functional description of the desired capability is detailed in the attached document.  RFI responses will be reviewed, with other information, in forming the IGSSR-C acquisition strategy with emphasis on possibilities for acquiring data fusion and automation capabilities.  The review of responses is not for the purpose of narrowing down to one source or to eliminate sources.<BR>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS<BR>Interested parties are requested to provide an information package consisting of: <BR>Company Profile - not to exceed one page, including point-of-contact, and summary performance history.  If citing contracts, please focus primarily on DoD contracts and identify the customer, contract number, and total dollar value.

Describe experience with decision support systems, data correlation/fusion, and operational displays employing geographical information systems.  <BR>Description of Products Available -  through the company, not to exceed one-half page per product, single spaced, minimum 12-point Times New Roman (or equivalent), that support one or more of the functions identified in the functional description and that could be integrated into an enterprise system.  Identify the basic functions the product performs, interface standards, current uses, and any major test events or demonstrations at which it received an evaluation or assessment.  For software not previously delivered to the government or delivered only with limited data rights, identify any constraints on government procurement of restricted data rights (FAR 52.227-14, Alternate III).<BR>Respondents are urged to limit marketing material in order to provide more substantive information in their response.  The government will not review any pages beyond the limits stated for each section or information including appendices, marketing brochures, catalogs, etc.  The Army will evaluate the responses to help identify interest and the ability of the vendor community to provide support in the areas outlined in this RFI.  All information received in response to this notice will be marked PROPRIETARY and handled accordingly.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with applicable government regulations.<BR>FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION <BR>1.	Operational Employment. IGSSR-C should enable a layered approach to security and force protection operations in the Fixed Site and Semi-Fixed Site/Expeditionary Operational Environments throughout the full spectrum of operations.  The system should minimize additional logistics and support requirements at these operating locations, which are often constrained for such basic services as electrical power, space, environmental conditioning, and network access.  The system should not increase the number of operators required to perform FP functions.<BR>2.	Incremental design. The IGSSR-C acquisition strategy reflects incremental development to allow early deployment of an initial capability.  At least two increments follow to add new capability as additional resources are secured and lengthy testing and certifications can be completed.  Potential increments are: <BR>a.	Increment 1. Includes integration of FP sensors and sub-systems with fusion and automation enhancements to create an accurate FP COP, improve situational awareness, and enable a quick, precise response. Includes net-ready interoperability capabilities.<BR>b.	Increment 2. Adds interoperability with tactical, classified networks and systems. Improves CBRN integration using CBRN Common Systems Interface (CCSI). Adds additional fusion capabilities to improve situational awareness.<BR>c.	Increment 3. Additional fusion capabilities to include enemy Course of Action (COA) prediction and friendly COA analysis and recommendation.  Adds enhancements to Consequence Management capabilities<BR>3.	Standards.  Security Equipment Integration Working Group (SEIWG) Interface Control Document (ICD) 0100 series and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Common Systems Interface (CCSI) are the newest standards for exchange of security-related sensor data and control information.  <BR>4.	Data.  IGSSR-C should support both the standard XML schema for exchange of sensor data and proprietary interfaces for many legacy sensors.  The latter may require adapters to translate proprietary formats into XML.  Sensor types may include cameras, radar, gunfire location, tripwire, fence line, and point detection of magnetic, seismic, acoustic, electro-optical, chemical, and radiological signatures.  Most sensors process these signatures into object information (e.g., detection of a vehicle, person, or chemical) and do not report raw signature data.  Other data may include locations of friendly forces, terrain features, barriers, roads, defended assets, etc., as well as information stores of adversary and friendly capabilities.  <BR>5.	Control.  IGSSR-C should support the standard XML schema for exchange of control information.  This should allow simultaneous control of multiple remote equipment items, by either operator command or automated procedures.  Many legacy equipment items may require adapters to translate proprietary formats into and from XML.  Examples of remote equipment include unmanned vehicles, unattended sensors, remotely-operated weapons, and point-tilt-zoom cameras.  Each instance of IGSSR-C should allow multiple controls, which can be individually configured for different watch stations, and should resolve contention among operators and automated procedures for control of individual remote equipment items.  <BR>6.	Interoperability. To facilitate data exchange and communication with other FP C2 and information systems, IGSSR-C must comply with Global Information Grid (GIG) technical guidance and DOD Information Assurance requirements including availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation.  It must complete interoperability testing and certification in accordance with CJCSI 6212.01E, Interoperability and Supportability of Information Technology and National Security Systems.  IGSSR-C must also comply with Net Centric Data Strategy, Net Centric Services Strategy, and the principles and rules identified in the DoD Information Enterprise Architecture to facilitate enterprise ownership and sharing of data.   <BR>7.	Automation.  IGSSR-C should automate tasks to reduce operator workload.  Rules for automation should be tailorable for each instance of IGSSR-C to best suit local conditions.  Automation examples include selecting and focusing cameras on point sensor detections, movement of unmanned vehicles to pre-determined overwatch positions, system-generated messages and warnings, and display management based on priority of sensor detections for a particular situation such as change in Force Protection Condition.<BR>8.	Fusion. IGSSR-C should fuse multiple information sources, as described by JDL fusion levels 1, 2 and 3, to provide improved assessments of individual objects, situation, and threat.  Systems administrators will be able to apply the fusion rules best suited to the local conditions.  Examples of level 1 fusion include suppression of sensor activations from friendly activity, correlation of multiple detections of the same entity into one, and discrimination of friendly and hostile gunfire by correlating gunfire detection with friendly force locations.  An example of level 2 fusion is prediction of an adversarys path based on a sequence of point detections and terrain.  An example of level 3 fusion is recommendation of a defensive action based on an estimate of an adversarys intent and the resources available to respond.<BR>9.	Common Operational Picture (COP). IGSSR-C should include a Force Protection(FP) COP which can use a variety of map terrain backgrounds and be able to distribute data to populate IGSSR-C system information, detections, and warnings on other FP COP systems.  The COP should include FP Asset locations and nodes, sensor activations, graphics and control measures, and BLUFOR element locations and tracking. The COP should be tailorable, enabling individual operators to display only information relevant to their duties.<BR>10.	Displays. . In addition to the COP Situational Awareness display, the system should show camera views and access and display forms, references, checklists, and report formats. The system should support desktop and mobile laptop monitors for all display requirements.  Displays should allow windowing.  Each instance of IGSSR-C should support multiple displays which can be individually configured for different watch stations.<BR>11.	Scalability. IGSSR-C should be scalable, modular and tailorable to support an indeterminate number of attached sensors and remotely operated equipment over a variable geographic area.  The system will be capable of interoperating with displays for other IGSSR-C instances at adjacent commands. <BR>INSTRUCTIONS FOR RESPONDANTS<BR>Submit requested information by e-mail:<BR>To: bruce.a.macfarlane.ctr@us.army.mil<BR>Cc: brian.murphy3@us.army.mil<BR>Deadline for submission is 4:00 PM EST, July 28, 2010.<BR>Formats should be viewable in Microsoft Word 2007 or Adobe Reader 9.<BR>No telephonic discussions will be held.<BR>

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for MS-50 Dry High Proudction Console Helium LeakDetector.NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from VIC Leak Detection, VIC part #0139-910-00, ona sole source basis.In support of the international Low Impact Docking System (iLIDS) the NASA GRC Seal Teamhas been tasked with developing the iLIDS main interface seal and quantifying its leakrate. The Seal Team is currently in search of a helium leak detector that can accuratelyquantify gross helium leak rates associated with the candidate main interface seals. Thenew leak detector will replace an existing Varian model 979 helium leak detector.Although the 979 has a relatively successful record quantifying very small leak rates(&lt;1x10-8 atm-cm3/s) it has had very limited success in accurately and repeatedlyquantifying large leaks (&gt;1x10-3 atm-cm3/s). The Seal Team evaluated three helium leak detectors from two vendors. The leak detectorswere the Varian models 979 and VS and a Vacuum Instrument Corporation (VIC) model MS-50.The Varian model VS and the VIC MS-50 were demonstration units provided by theirrespective manufacturers and the Varian model 979 was the leak detector currently beingused by the Seal Team. Early in the evaluation the Varian VS was eliminated due to itsinability to measure helium leak rates greater that 9.9x10-4atm-cm3/s, which is below theleak rates of our test specimens. Therefore, no additional observations of the VS weremade.It should be noted that the Varian model 979 has been discontinued and its replacement,the VS, cannot quantify leak rates &gt;9.9x10-4 atm-cm3/s. The VIC MS-50 has demonstratedthe ability to accurately a repeatedly quantify gross leak rates in the10-3 atm-cm3/srange. Based on the iLIDS teams market research, the MS-50 is the only known helium leakdetector that meets the requirements for the test and evaluation of candidate seals todock to the International Space Station.  Vacuum Instrument Corporation (VIC) is theoriginal equipment manufacturer of the MS-50.  It is in the best interest of theGovernment to award this procurement to VIC without any further competition.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the SimplifiedAcquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13. This is under the authority of FARReference 13.106-1(b)1. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon July 19, 2010. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for Oxide/Oxide CMC Mixer Nozzle Hardware.NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from COI Ceramics, Inc., 9617 Distribution Avenue,San Diego, CA 92121-2307.We request that COI Ceramics, Inc. fabricate oxide/oxide CMC (ceramic matrix composite)mixer nozzle hardware reinforced with Nextel 610 fibers. This materials supplier wasselected for the following reasons: 	NASA GRC has obtained test samples fabricated by COIC, Inc.  The properties fromthose samples should be fairly representative of the properties of those in the mixernozzle hardware.  This oxide/oxide material is truly state-of-the-art for the temperatureregime and application of interest.	COIC has demonstrated the ability to make a similar component (with the desiredwall thickness and maintenance of overall dimensions).  Their ability to fabricate thisarticle, which engineers from NASA GRC have seen, led to plans for obtaining and testingsuch a component (CMC mixer nozzle hardware). 	COI Ceramics, Inc. has state-of-the-art CMC processing equipment and experiencefabricating oxide/oxide composite panels/specimens/ subcomponents that are reinforcedwith different types of Nextel fibers.	Results from testing several types of oxide/oxidecomposites are provided by COIC at their website: www.coiceramics.com	We have touredtheir facilities and found their processing ability to be state of the art.  We (GRC)have worked with them in the area of SiC/SiC CMCs, and have found that they consistentlyproduce high quality CMCs.  The nature of the effort (teaming) has led to us only beingable to use COIC as the CMC fabricator.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the SimplifiedAcquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13.

<a href="mailto:jason.mcclean@ang.af.mil">178 FW/MSC</a>
<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the water distribution and wastewater collection systems for the Ohio Air National Guard Base (ANGB) located at Springfield-Beckley Municipal Airport to the City of Springfield.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. The City (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems and will be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the government. The 178th Fighter Wing (FW) of the Ohio Air National Guard occupies 113.6 acres of leased land on the Springfield-Beckley Municipal Airport, located in central Ohio, approximately five miles south of the city of Springfield and approximately 50 miles west of Columbus.  The 178th FW occupies 9 administrative, 25 industrial, and 6 services buildings totaling approximately 367,000 square feet with approximately 400 full-time personnel.  A unit training drill is conducted twice a month and results in a surge of up to a total of approximately 900 personnel. Water is supplied by the City of Springfield and enters the base at two points.  There are two separate water distribution systems on the base.  System 1 is the main system and is looped with numerous dead-end branches.  System 2, is configured as a dead-end branched system. The distribution system consists of approximately 1,100 linear feet of PVC pipe, 6,200 linear feet of ductile iron pipe, and 8,500 linear feet of transite pipe. Pipe diameters range from two to twenty inches. Pipe is buried without the use of tracer wire or marking tape. The system also has 30 cast iron-gate valves, 28 fire hydrant assemblies, and one 12 by 14 by 8 foot deep masonry block manhole. Base personnel indicate the capacity of the current system is adequate for present and future needs. The Springfield-Beckley Municipal Airport (ANG) wastewater collection system operates via gravity flow with lift station augmentation (no force main).  It exits the base at 13 locations.  The wastewater collection system consists of approximately 1,600 linear feet of PVC pipe, 850 linear feet of cast iron pipe, and 6,500 linear feet of vitrified clay pipe.  Pipes range in size from four to eight inches. Pipe depth ranges from four to eight feet without tracer wire or warning tape. The system includes one lift station and 18 pre-cast concrete and 8 brick manholes. Base personnel indicate the capacity of the current system is adequate for present and future needs.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility systems will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The water distribution and wastewater collection systems being privatized are described as follows.  Competitive proposals were requested in 2001 and no offers were received on either the water distribution or wastewater collection system. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution systems, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the systems; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.  All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<BR><BR>Interested sources shall contact MSgt Jason A. McClean at jason.mcclean@ang.af.mil or 937.327.2310 (e-mail is the preferred means of communication).  <BR>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse intends to negotiate, evaluate, and award a purchase order on a sole source basis to Corrigall Consulting for professional services in the nicotine and addiction research field in the areas of ligand discovery, disease mechanism discovery and model development, and the translation of preclinical discovery to early-stage development.</p>
<p>Specifically, Corrigall Consulting will perform the following:</p>
<p>Task 1: Support NIDA efforts in the development of medications for smoking cessation, in the form of a Product Development Partnership or other mechanisms.</p>
<p>Assist in the development and editing of text documents for the potential PDP, including position papers, logistical documents, summaries, RFIs, RFAs or other FOAs; assist with the organization and coordination of stakeholder/partner meetings, and contributing to these meetings from the contractor's experience with NIDA/NIH, the nicotine and drug dependence field, and knowledge of activity in medication development for tobacco dependence; participate in management structures, ad hoc or regularly, that would be required to guide the PDP or related ventures (steering and/or oversight committees, project management teams, etc); assist with the development of initiatives that may be required to support the PDP or, in the event that it does not advance, initiatives that would continue to serve NIDA's interests in the development of medications for tobacco dependence; and, develop and advance a proposal for a NIDA-led consensus meeting to review the state of the science with respect to the development of medications for tobacco dependence, recommendations from which could usefully inform the drug discovery process broadly. Such a meeting could be led by the Institute of Medicine with NIDA guidance or, if budgetary constraints are limiting, the meeting could be an NIH State-of-the-Science Conference.</p>
<p>Task 2: Monitor, assess and facilitate progress in the National Cooperative Drug Discovery and Development Groups (NCDDDG) Initiative in collaboration with NIDA staff. This initiative currently comprises 4 funded (and 1 pending) cooperative agreement awards within NIDA.</p>
<p>Function as coordinator on all NIDA-funded and NIDA co-funded applications, and assist in planning through participation in regular executive committee conference calls with group investigators, participation in annual meetings, and maintaining liaison with NIDA program staff; assist in making the research findings from the groups available more widely, particularly by facilitating the translation of new ligands and novel ligand screening approaches to the broader research community and to the appropriate next stages of research and/or development; and, link activities within the NCDDDG program to other NIDA/NIH funded initiatives as warranted. In particular, the contractor will link emerging developments in the NCDDDG to PDP project management or other NIDA drug discovery activities.</p>
<p>Task 3: Advance the agenda for discovery research in the area of nicotine addiction specifically and broadly in drug addiction, and contribute to bridging the gap between mechanism discovery and early stage drug development. The latter dimension is being increasing abandoned by the pharmaceutical industry as a direct result of lack of progress in the former. NIDA has an opportunity to address the loss by targeting funding to specific research areas. Activities by the contractor will include:</p>
<p>Maintaining contact with nicotine researchers and scanning the published literature to keep abreast of potential lead developments, such as certain nicotinic cholinergic receptors subtypes, and novel neurochemical mechanisms; working with NIDA staff to develop research initiatives to explore further promising leads, such as novel nicotinic receptor subtypes which are emerging as potentially important candidates in tobacco dependence; publish scientific articles and reviews in target discovery and early translational research, consistent with the contractor's expertise (e.g., Lerman et al, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 2007; Corrigall, Psychopharmacology 2009); and, encourage researchers to apply fro targeted funding opportunities by personal interactions, through scientific meetings, and by assisting in the organization of workshops. For the contract period, workshops could be held at the Society for Neuroscience in November 2010 and the Wellcome Trust Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors meeting in May 2011.</p>
<p>The Contractor will report on the progress of all activities at least monthly to the NIDA Project Officer, by telephone conference call, face-to-face meetings, and/or written form.</p>
<p>Corrigall Consulting (William Corrigall) was a research scientist at the Addiction Research Foundation/University of Toronto in Toronto (now the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health) for 25 years. During this time he published seminal work on nicotine addiction using laboratory animal models and human experimental paradigms. He is a past president of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco. In May 2002, Dr. Corrigall joined NIDA as Chief of the Translational Research Branch and Director of NIDA's Nicotine and Tobacco Addiction Program. In this latter role, Dr. Corrigall has implemented major efforts that support NIDA's mission in drug addiction as it relates to tobacco. These include, establishing initiatives in translational (Translating Tobacco Addiction Research to Treatment RFA) and ligand discovery/development research (National Cooperative Drug Discovery Groups for Mood Disorders or Nicotine Addiction RFA), as well as sustaining NIDA's efforts in transdisciplinary tobacco centers (Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Centers RFA).</p>

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to increase the ceiling of a Sole Source Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Frontier Systems, Inc. of Irvine, CA based on FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements), for the procurement of a Military Utility Assessment (MUA) and integration of the A-160T UAS (Unmanned Aviation System). The increase in ceiling is due to the increase in testing requirements for the MUA and A-160T in support of the United States Special Operations Command Extended User Evaluation. The original cost and schedule of developmental activities to mature this system were underestimated. There has been emerging needs to evaluate additional capabilities in relevant operational environments. The system remains in the requirements definition stage, which necessitates further evaluation. The A160T UAS is proprietary to Frontier Systems Inc, and is currently the only manufacturer and developer of the A160T UAS. Orders will be comprised of engineering, systems engineering, development, integration, and testing necessary to provide mature and reliable A160T UAS with relevant payloads for military utility assessment and extended user evaluation. The effort will be focused on integration, demonstration, and potential transition of the VTOL UAV (vertical take off and landing of the unmanned aerial vehicle). No RFP is available for competitive bidding. However, interested parties may submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement, to include descriptive literature, with 15 days of this announcement to the contact person listed in this announcement, which will be considered by this agency. See Numbered Note 22.<br />

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:spencer.sessions@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific (SPAWAR SSC Pacific) intends to negotiate asole-source, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract with URS Group,Inc., San Francisco, CA, for a follow-on contract to N66001-05-D-5025 whichexpires 27 September 2010.
This contract will provide continued planning, development and implementationof improvements to the Navy's Very Low Frequency / Low Frequency (VLF/LF)broadcast communications systems. The Fixed Submarine Broadcast System(FSBS) Antennas Program of Record that supports the VLF/LF Antennas locatedat 10 sites worldwide, used for one-way communications to U.S. submarinesoperating below periscope depth. SPAWAR SSC Pacific, Code 55420, is thedesignated PMW-770 FSBS Antenna In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA) and isresponsible for executing the applicable in-service engineering services as itrelates to Radio Frequency (RF) hardware components for the Antennasthemselves and rooftop of the Helix Tuning House co-located at each antennasite. The FSBS Antennas project also performs site upgrades and variousresearch and development efforts to improve the VLF/LF communicationstechnology. Under this effort URS is to provide technical support, maintenance,and improvements to these VLF/LF submarine communications transmissionsites. The VLF/LF antenna systems have been in operation for over 25 yearsand their Radio Frequency (RF) hardware components have surpassed theirintended lifecycle and therefore require regular maintenance, replacement, andupgrades to preserve the FSBS broadcast reliability.
Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) andFAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services willsatisfy agency requirements.
No two of the ten VLF/LF transmit antenna sites are configured identically asthey were all built with different specifications and - in some cases -utilizingtowers originally configured to broadcast other types of signals. Therefore,thestructural, mechanical, and electrical engineering work is site specific anddoesnot lend itself to standardized maintenance or configuration managementsolutions. The learning curve gained by URS over the last 10 years hastherefore become invaluable to the FSBS program.  For example, the URSteam played a significant role in development of the standard composite feed-though bushing, which was assembled and tested at the EBHVTF and recentlyinstalled at NRTF Lualualei, Hawaii in March 2010.  While the contractor hadexperience with installing the new composite bushing at LF Niscemi, Italy andLF Awase, Okinawa, each of these three sites were configured differently withrespects to its helix tuning house and tower feed connections. Moreimportantly, Hawaii utilizes a two-tower broadcast design while Okinawa andItaly utilize a one-tower design. In order to accomplish these installations,URSrequired a thorough understanding of the engineering design principles behindboth kinds of VLF broadcast stations (1-tower vs. 2-tower designs aresignificantly different) and site specific understanding of each one.  Severalmore sites will require custom built solutions for new composite feed-thoughbushings in the next five years such as the feed-through bushings  in CutlerMaine that require a special 60 Hz pass through capability to allow thermalheatgenerated by the electricity to melt ice on each antenna panel.
Integral to the tasking on this requirement is the ability to continually testdevelopmental RF components at the SSC Pacific Edgar Beauchamp HighVoltage Test Facility (EBHVTF) located in Dixon, California. The EBHVTF is theonly facility available in the world with the capability to test antennahardwarecomponents at the high voltages and high currents at Navy bands in VLF (14-30 kHz) and LF (30-160 kHz) ranges.  A team of individuals at URS were thecontractors that built the EBHVTF facility and currently retains the most-up-to-date, firsthand knowledge of how the transmitter and test cells are configuredfor high current/high voltage RF components as well as on-the-air broadcasts.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interestedparties may identify their interest and capability to respond to therequirementor submit proposals. Information received will normally be considered solelyforthe purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Adetermination by the Government to compete the proposed contract basedupon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of theGovernment.
The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is541990, and the size standard is $7M. The anticipated period of performancewill be approximately five years. The maximum estimated value of the effort is$6,900,000. Questions concerning this sole source contract action may bedirected to Spencer M. Sessions at spencer.sessions@navy.mil. Questionsand/or responses are due by 16 August 2010.

<p><br />Proposal Submission Place:<br />Mrs. Afaf Abdel Azim<br />General Manager of stores and purchases<br />Egyptian Electricity Holding Company<br />P.O. Box 11517, Nasr City<br />Cairo, Egypt<br />Tel.: 202-22617957<br />Fax: 202-22634940</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Smart Metering Project.</p>
<p>The project was originally identified by the Egyptian Electric Utility and Consumer Protection Regulatory Agency, who designated it as a top priority. The project is designed to provide improvements to the distribution of electric networks by installing smart meters. The major tasks of the study include:</p>
<p>&#61607; Analysis of Available Information;<br />&#61607; Smart Metering Overview;<br />&#61607; Smart Meter Implementation Program;<br />&#61607; Smart Meter Integration;<br />&#61607; Cost Estimating;<br />&#61607; Economic Analysis;<br />&#61607; Financing Mechanism Analysis;<br />&#61607; Preliminary Environmental and Development Impact Assessment;<br />&#61607; Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Reviews; and<br />&#61607; Draft Final and Final Report Preparation and Presentation.</p>
<p>The overall project cost in the first three years is conservatively estimated at US$231-447 million with full implementation valued at over US$1.8 billion.</p>
<p>EEHC, Egyptian Electricity Holding Company (joint stock company), is in charge of all transmission and distribution, along with most of the generation activities in the country. EEHC will serve as the project Grantee.</p>
<p>The main objective of the project is to develop an action document for the implementation of smart meters in Egypt distribution sector. The document should take into account the current situation in the electric distribution sector, anticipated sector developments, and proposed initiatives.</p>
<p>The ultimate objective of the project is to install modern smart meters for as many of the country's 24 million customers as possible. The actual number of meters installed will depend on the expected economic benefits of the proposed program, funding mechanisms, technical limitations for such installations, and various externalities.</p>
<p>Projects of this nature have been considered and implemented in various other countries in the world. Total numbers of smart meters deployed worldwide today is estimated at over 70 million. It is projected that this number will grow to over 212 million by 2015 in the United States and Europe alone. Some experts suggest that China will replace 300 million electricity meters over the next five or so years.</p>
<p>Typical reasons cited for smart meter installations include:</p>
<p>&#61607; Efficiency and reliability gains;<br />&#61607; Environmental concerns;<br />&#61607; Improved customer service;<br />&#61607; Energy theft reduction; and<br />&#61607; Increasing energy market competition.</p>
<p>All but the last one are currently applicable to the situation with Egyptian distribution companies. The last issue related to markets may become pertinent if Egypt decides to privatize its distribution companies.</p>
<p>The feasibility study will culminate in the development of an implementation program for large-scale smart meter installation in Egypt. The program will include several implementation stages based on the following major factors:</p>
<p>&#61607; Availability of technology;<br />&#61607; Availability of resources for installation, organization, and maintenance;<br />&#61607; Cost implications and availability of funding; and<br />&#61607; Direct and indirect benefits of smart meter installation.</p>
<p>The program is expected to start in 2011 and last several years. The ultimate target is to cover as many of 24 million residential customers as possible within the four to five (4-5) year period. The feasibility study shall recommend the most feasible implementation options. These may include smart meter pilot programs for one or two distribution companies, followed by expansion into other, more rural distribution systems. Alternatively, the implementation program can start at all distribution companies and expand gradually.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$416,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.

Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

4.	Statutory Authority: The statutory authority permitting this action is FAR 6.302-1(c). The required International Business Machine (IBM) products are proprietary and the existence of limited rights in data, patent rights and copyrights makes the supplies and services available from only one source, IBM.  The proposed solicitation will include a purchase description to specify the IBM and other intricately related brand name, products, or features of products, peculiar to the one manufacturer (IBM) and shall not provide for full and open competition regardless of the number of sources solicited.  Other than full and open competition is applicable as described in FAR 6.302-1 (c), Application for brand name descriptions.
5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above: Only the brand name IBM hardware specified in paragraph 3 above will satisfy the Government's requirements. Using alternative products would compromise the integrity of the end product, increase testing and could potentially necessitate manual review of the product. It is also imperative to duplicate the production environment to resolve issues and provide feedback for both current and future products. The operating systems installed on existing IBM hardware are various versions of Windows and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. All of the hardware and software needs to support the current configurations have been tested within the current infrastructure of the Austin AITC.  Procurement of additional IBM hardware ensures the integrity of the lab such that applications will not be locked when conducting testing of emerging technologies on the operating systems. The systems will be maintained by Health Systems Engineering & Design (HSE&D) staff at AITC but will benefit all EIE systems engineering design and core services activities.

6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted to survey the marketplace to ensure competition for the brand name IBM hardware described herein.  The details are in the market research section of this document in paragraph 8 below. 
 
7.	Actions to Increase Competition:  All NASA Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurements (SEWP) IV Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) orders are placed under existing IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity) contracts, and thus are not required to be synopsized pursuant to FAR 16.505(a)(1) and FAR5.202(a)(6).  The SEWP IV GWAC is composed of five (5) groups of contracts.  At a minimum, to provide Fair Opportunity as required by FAR Part 16, all contract holders within any one individual group must be provided the opportunity to quote.  Instructions on the SEWP web-site state that if there is a brand name specific request, then the request for quotation (RFQ) should be submitted to all four (4) SEWP contract groups in order to full notify all interested parties, therefore, all four (4) contract groups will be solicited.

8.	Market Research:  Market research inquires from the SEWP IV website indicate that the required hardware described in paragraph 3 above is currently available from many SEWP vendors.  The requirements shall be solicited under the SEWP IV contracts pursuant to the memorandum issued by Robert T. Howard, Assistant Secretary for Information and Technology, on June 1, 2007.  The memorandum instructs VA offices to use the SEWP IV contract for all IT hardware and software acquisitions as of June 15, 2007. The required IBM hardware is widely available on the SEWP schedule by using the applicable search feature on the part numbers described in paragraph 3 above against the established catalog or price lists available at the SEWP IV website, http://www.sewp.nasa.gov.   The Contracting 
Specialist has conducted market research amongst SEWP IV holders on and has identified eleven vendors which will ensure sufficient competition. Three of the eleven contract holders are identified as SDVOSBs.   

9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: 
None.

10.	Technical and Requirements Certification:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>Through this Announcement, NASA seeks to select Allied Organizations for specificprize competitions (hereinafter Challenges) to be conducted under the CentennialChallenges Program of NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.Allied Organizations are responsible for the following elements as they relate toindividual Challenges:	Challenge Planning.	Sponsor Recruitment.	Competitor Recruitment.	Challenge Administration and Execution.	Challenge Publicity.NASA provides the monetary prize purse (which can be supplemented by outsideorganizations) but no funding for the conduct of the competition itself.  AlliedOrganizations must administer the Challenges with their own funding or they must raisethe funding needed to administer the Challenges through partnerships with sponsoringorganizations or through other means.  Sponsoring organizations are those entities that partner with an Allied Organization tocontribute funding for administrative expenses or in-kind support through separateagreements between the Allied Organization and the sponsoring organization.  Space Act AgreementsNASA anticipates entering into unfunded Space Act Agreements with selected AlliedOrganizations to manage the Challenges associated with each of the planned CentennialChallenges.  Selection of Allied Organizations will be through a competitive processbased on evaluation of submitted proposals.  Participation as an Allied Organization willbe contingent upon selection by NASA and negotiation of an appropriate agreement betweenNASA and the proposer.	The Space Act Agreement will detail the contributions andresponsibilities of NASA and the Allied Organization for a specific Challenge.	Theagreement will address intellectual property rights, concurrence on rules, teamagreements, media rights, insurance, registration fees and eligibility and typicallyinclude a term of 3 years.  NASA reserves the right to select for Space Act Agreementnegotiations all, some, or none of the proposals submitted in response to thisAnnouncement.  Respondents will be responsible for funding their own activitiesassociated with responding to this Announcement and conducting the Challenge. AlliedOrganizations may collect reasonable registration fees from competitors but the use ofregistration fees as a primary means to cover Challenge administration costs isdiscouraged.EligibilityDomestic non-profit organizations are eligible to submit proposals in response to thisAnnouncement.  Allied Organizations cannot compete in the Challenge that they manage. Allied Organizations and their officers and employees may not have a financial or otherinterest in any teams that compete in any Challenge(s) they manage.Organizations may submit proposals to manage one or more of the specific CentennialChallenges described in this announcement but a separate proposal must be submitted foreach Challenge.  Multiple organizations may form partnerships to manage a Challenge andmay submit a joint proposal.Centennial Challenges BackgroundNASA Centennial Challenges was established to conduct prize competitions to generateinnovative solutions to technical problems of interest to NASA and the nation.	Thosecompeting for the prizes can be individuals, independent teams, student groups, researchorganizations or private companies but they cannot receive government funding to supportany of their work related to the technical area of the prize Challenge.  The programseeks unconventional solutions from non-traditional sources and, thereby, hopes toidentify new talent and stimulate the creation of new businesses.  Unlike contracts andgrants based on proposals, prizes are only awarded after competitors have successfullydemonstrated their innovations.  Competitors retain ownership of their intellectualproperty. The Centennial Challenges in the past have typically required several annual competitionsto occur before the total prize purses have been claimed.  Competitions may be conductedin a first-to-demonstrate format or in a head-to-head contest format.  The competitionevents, especially in the head-to-head contest format, typically involve publicspectators, televised or Webcasted coverage and are high-visibility opportunities forpublic outreach and education.	Additional information can be found atwww.nasa.gov/challengesNew Centennial ChallengesThe specific Challenges for which Allied Organizations are sought with this Announcementare:1)	Nano-Satellite Launch Challenge - to place a small satellite into Earth orbit,twice in one week.  The prize purse is $2 million.2)	Sample Return Robot Challenge - to demonstrate a robot that can locate andretrieve geologic samples from a wide and varied terrain without human control.  Theprize purse is $1.5 million.3)	Night Rover Challenge - to demonstrate a solar-powered exploration vehicle thatcan operate in darkness using its own stored energy.  The prize purse is $1.5 million.Descriptions of each of these Challenges outlining NASAs objectives are provided in theappendix to this announcement.	Further refinement and creative enhancement of theChallenge concepts by the Allied Organizations, with concurrence by NASA, are encouraged.Selection CriteriaNASA will select Allied Organizations based on the following evaluation criteria:1)	Capabilities of the organization to administer the Challenge and competitionevents including ability to:a.	promote the technical and educational goals of the Challenge through creative useof public media including Web sites.b.	attract multiple competitors with wide geographic distribution.c.	encourage the participation of individuals, groups, students, and businesses,especially those outside the traditional aerospace community and those from minority andunder-represented communities.d.	formulate competition rules and plans in consultation with NASA and withappropriate public comment.e.	provide appropriate competition venues and supporting equipment.f.	select qualified judges.g.	conduct competitor registration.h.	establish agreements with competitors covering legal, insurance, and otherissues.i.	maintain communication with competitors and with NASA.j.	collect and report aggregate data on competitor progress and performance.k.	plan competition events and other meetings.l.	conduct competition events safely and impartially.m.	organize educational activities to enhance and broaden the impact of theChallenge.n.	report competition results to NASA and to the public. 2)	Experience of the organization in similar or analogous activities thatdemonstrate competence, integrity, commitment to safety, and ability to workcooperatively in partnering arrangements.3)	Ability of the organization to support Challenge administration through internalfinancial resources or firm commitments of sponsors.

Innovations in propulsion and other technologies as well as operations andmanagement for broader applications in future launch systems.	A commercial capability for dedicated launches of small satellites at a costcomparable to secondary payload launches--a potential new market with Government,commercial, and academic customers.DescriptionDeliver a payload with a mass of at least 1 kilogram and dimensions of at least 10x10x11centimeters to Earth orbit, complete at least one orbit past the launch site and deliverpayloads successfully at least two times in one week.  The specified payload matches the standard 1U CubeSat.	One orbit past the launch siteimposes an absolute minimum orbital velocity requirement and an injection maneuver toachieve orbit.	Repeatability within a time constraint deters one-time stunts that wouldnot lead to a useful launch capability.  This is anticipated to be a first-to-demonstratechallenge.Allied Organizations will have to verify that payloads have been placed in orbit viaground tracking or other means, which might be done through partnerships with NASA, theU.S. Air Force, private entities or through sponsorships.  Range safety costs andprocedures will be a critical issue for competitors, but some existing and new ranges mayoffer incentives to attract competitors.  The Federal Aviation Administration will havean important role in permitting and/or licensing of competitors.Prize Purse $2 million is available from the Centennial Challenges Program.  If additional prizefunds become available from the Government or other sources, a second-place prize andsupplemental prizes might be offered for the primary objective or additionalaccomplishments. Educational OpportunitiesCompetitors could offer payload space to student payloads.  University teams may attemptthe Challenge itself but a student-level competition for a suborbital flight to a veryhigh altitude (i.e. 100 miles) might be considered.  Such efforts should be coordinatedwith the NASA Student Launch Initiative and other existing programs.  Some additionalprize money may be available for student-level competitions.Sample Return Robot ChallengeObjectivesAn autonomous capability to locate and retrieve specific sample types from variouslocations over a wide and varied terrain and return those samples to a designated zone ina reasonable amount of time with limited mapping data.Description Demonstrate a robotic system to locate and collect a set of specific sample types from alarge planetary analog area and return the samples to the starting zone.  The roving areashould include rolling terrain, granular medium, soft soils, and a variety of rocks. Apre-cached sample and several other samples would be located in smaller sampling zoneswithin the larger roving area.	Teams will be given aerial/geological/topographic mapswith appropriate orbital resolution, including the location of the starting position anda pre-cached sample. The samples should be easily distinguished from other materials present at the site sincethe need for sophisticated scientific instrumentation for sample identification is not anobjective of this Challenge.  The task in this Challenge is envisioned to requiremultiple hours to complete.  Limits may be imposed for mass and power, etc.  Robots arefree to use whatever method of mobility, manipulation, and navigation they choose exceptGlobal Positioning System navigation, which is not a realistic capability innon-terrestrial environments.  The winning criteria may include the shortest time tocomplete the task and lowest system mass.In order to win a Level-1 prize, a robot must retrieve only the pre-cached sample. Robots should be autonomous, but periodic intervention with teleoperation would bepermitted with penalties imposed for its use.In order to win a Level-2 prize, a team must autonomously navigate at all times and mustretrieve the pre-cached sample and several additional sample types that may include rock,regolith, gas, liquid, etc. from separate large regions of the roving area that will beof different terrain types. Prize Purse $1.5 million is available from the Centennial Challenges Program.  This amount can besupplemented with funds from other sources.Educational OpportunitiesIn addition to Level 1 and Level 2, a simpler task for a Nationwide high schoolcompetition might be offered.  Some additional prize money may be available forstudent-level competitions.Night Rover ChallengeObjectives	A mobile system to collect solar energy, store that energy, and, later, use itproductively. 	Innovations in energy storage technology for space operations and, in particular,to meet the demands imposed by the daylight/darkness cycle on the Moon. 	Energy system innovations to benefit terrestrial applications, including vehiclesand renewable energy generation systems. Description Solar energy is a renewable source that would be available on the Moon and at otherdestinations in space.	To enable practical system demonstrations of diverse designsolutions by independent teams, the Challenge may be conducted in an ambient Earthenvironment.  The Challenge would be to demonstrate a portable energy collection andstorage system through several cycles of daylight and darkness.  During the daylightperiod, systems can collect photons or thermal energy from the sun.  During darkness, thestored energy would be used to move the entire mobile system toward a destination.  Thecompetitors may collect, store, and extract the solar energy in any form that theydesire. The winning system would be the one that moved the greatest distance during darkness inan allotted time period (over several day/night cycles) using only its own stored energy. A winning system must exceed the performance of a reference state-of-the-art system by aspecified margin.  Competitors with successful and appropriate system designs might beinvited to test their energy storage systems in NASA thermal-vacuum chambers todemonstrate applicability to the space and lunar environment. Prize Purse $1.5 million is available from the Centennial Challenges Program.  This amount can besupplemented with funds from other sources.Educational OpportunitiesA simple solar-powered, remote-controlled rover competition with an energy storagerequirement might be conducted for students along with the main Night Rover Challenge.	Some additional prize money may be available for student-level competitions.

Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLslinked below. Below is a draft version of the Statement of Work for this RFI:1. Purpose, Objective, and Background of Work to be Performed:The Independent Program Assessment Office (IPAO), within the Office of IndependentProgram and Cost Evaluation (IPCE), has the responsibility for enabling the independentreview (an unbiased, objective review of the maturity, health and status) of the Agency'sprograms and projects at life cycle milestones to ensure the highest probability ofmission success. The IPAO ensures the objectivity, quality, integrity and consistency ofthe independent review process required by the NASA Space Flight Program and ProjectManagement Requirements, NPR 7120.5, and NASA Systems Engineering Processes andRequirements, NPR 7123.1. This independent program and project review process is acollaborative effort between IPCE, the Mission Directorates, the Office of the ChiefEngineer, Office of Safety and Mission Assurance, Chief Health and Medical Office (asneeded), and the independent technical authority community at the NASA Centers and theNESC support of the Agency's Program Management Councils. The IPAO will ensure the reviewneeds of each of these communities are met while maintaining the integrity andindependence of the review process consistent with the Agency's governance model asdocumented in the NASA Strategic Management and Governance Handbook, NPD 1000.0. Specifically within the realm of schedule assessments and schedule risk analysis, theIPAO develops independent schedule assessments/schedule risk analysis and Joint(cost/schedule) Confidence Level (JCL) products for projects (particularly thoserequiring Congressional reporting) and for all programs as part of the independentreviews, particularly at the preliminary approval (e.g. pre-non-advocate review) andapproval (e.g. non-advocate review) key decision points.  Furthermore, IPAO isresponsible for developing an independent schedule assessments/risk analysis and JCL foreach designated review and facilitating the integration of the cost estimate and scheduleassessment/risk analysis into the overall program/project assessment. The objective of this statement of work is for the contractor to provide in situ (onsite) senior level schedule analysts, 3, to the IPAO to support the execution of IPAOresponsibilities.  Contractors will be located in situ (in place) within the IPAO officesat LaRC.2. Description of the Work to be Performed:  The Contractor shall perform the followingtask requirements:2.1  Kick-Off Briefing/Meeting.  Within 7 days of award, the contractor shall scheduleand host a kick-off briefing/meeting.  At this time specific direction will be given tothe contractor as to program/project(s) to be analyzed.2.2  Task Plan.  Within 15 days of this award, the contractor shall deliver a task planfor completing the efforts within this task.		2.3  Deliverables.The primary task will be to develop comprehensive schedule assessments/risk analysis andJCL of the life cycle schedule for the NASA programs/projects.	The contractor shallprovide in situ schedule assessments and risk analysis, technical assessment, and systemsengineering support to the IPAO as directed. The contractor shall support meetings, whichmay take place in different locations including NASA centers or contractor facilities,related to program and project reviews. The assessments will include development,production, and operations assessments. Working with the lead civil service IPAO scheduleanalyst and in full coordination with IPAO assigned cost estimators, Standing ReviewBoards and/or other IPAO sanctioned review teams, the contractor shall conductindependent schedule assessments/risk analysis, analogy estimates, and Joint(cost/schedule) Confidence Level (JCL) assessments.  To be able to perform the JCLassessments schedule analysts are expected to have an in-depth knowledge of Pertmasterand a working knowledge of additional probabilistic tools such as @Risk Professional forProject or Risk+. Schedule trades and sensitivity analyses shall be done as required. Thecontractor shall also support:	 research to improve the IPAO schedule assessmentprocess; identification and benchmarking of tools; recommendation of products;development of schedule estimating relationships (SER); and consultation and training onschedule risk analysis as required.Schedule assessments are performed to determine if the schedule submitted by theprogram/project has been developed using standard best practices. The schedule logic,activity durations and availability of resources will be assessed to determine if thepotential impact on schedule uncertainty.  Program/project schedule management policiesand practices will also be assessed to determine if they are using current analyticaltools and will provide adequate reports and information that can be used by managers tomake informed decisions. The schedule risk analysis will be performed to determine theimpact of technical or programmatic risks and uncertainties that are uncovered during theschedule assessment on the ability of the program/project to execute the schedule asplanned. The combined uncertainty and risk analysis will be used to supportrecommendations for the amount of funded schedule reserve the program/project should becarrying and as input to the Joint Confidence Level assessment.For each schedule assessment, as directed by IPAO, the contractor shall:-Develop an SRB independent schedule assessment and schedule risk analysis using aprobabilistic analysis to evaluate the discrete risks. The schedule analyst will also usea copy of the analytical model provided by the program/project, apply the discrete risksidentified by the SRB and compare the results with the SRB analytical results. -Provide comments to facilitate the development of the Schedule Analysis DataRequirements as part of the Cost Analysis Data Requirements (CADRe).-Provide the project's Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) ensuring all elements of schedulehave been captured and annotate those elements outside of the scope of this effort andthe accompanying rationale.-Provide a list of areas of uncertainty affecting the schedule estimate and include themin the schedule risk analysis-Provide the ground rules and assumptions affecting the schedule estimate.-Provide a data collection plan.-Provide rationale for selecting a particular set of estimating methodologies and therationale for not selecting other sets of estimating methodologies.-Provide a list of primary and cross-check methodologies for major schedule elements and,if applicable, provide rationale for significant difference (over 20%) between the SRBand program/project methodologies.-Provide, if applicable, estimate ranges, i.e., risk assessment and analyses, probabilitydistribution, and/or Monte Carlo simulation.-Provide assistance, as requested, in preparation for management presentations.-Attend, as required, IPAO staff meetings to receive and disseminate schedule reviewinformation to IPAO management.

<DESC><p>The United States Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Acquisition Management Division is requesting information from interested vendors who can provide high definition video-conferencing equipment, services, installation and maintenance for up to ten (10) locations across the US. Potential period of performance is 12 months base period with four one-year option periods. MSHA is conducting market research to gain an understanding of the capabilities and qualifications that exist in the marketplace as well as to finalize an acquisition strategy and potentially release an RFP. It is anticipated that any RFP released would be a small business set aside.</p>
<p>MSHA intends to improve consistency in enforcement activities and enhance the knowledge and skills of mine inspectors through the use of increased contemporary telecommunications technologies. Improved communication technology also will facilitate the effective engagement of MSHA's highly-decentralized field personnel in understanding and responding to key outcomes and initiatives of the Secretary and MSHA and reduce the variability sometimes associated with the delivery of live training sessions. The Telepresence solution will provide more consistent, effective, and cost efficient training to MSHA inspectors. Telepresence will eliminate variability associated with the delivery of multiple training sessions on the same topic and foster consistency in enforcement activities, improving MSHA's ability to prevent death, injury, and illness from mining.

<CONTACT>Miranda Canody, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-254-7151, Email Miranda.Canody@dhs.gov - Phorsha R Peel, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-254-7095, Fax 202-254-7785, Email phorsha.peel@dhs.gov
<DESC><p>The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) has cross-cutting responsibility for coordinating activities related to the threat of terrorists acquiring and using nuclear weapons to attack the United States. The office integrates all of DHS's work on nuclear-detection research, development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, and operational support.</p>
<p>Although the office's work is often seen as focused on detectors narrowly (i.e., devices), its responsibilities are actually broader. Nuclear detection, after all, is a system problem. Effectiveness may be limited by devices, but it may also be limited by the architecture of their deployment, situational awareness, communications, intelligence, cross-agency cooperation, responsiveness to threat indicators, and ability to disambiguate information quickly. Furthermore, and especially in the case of a continuing crisis, effectiveness may depend on sustainability of efforts, forensics, and the robustness of the system to damage. Significantly, effectiveness will depend on the ability to deal with adversary tactics, which will likely attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities. Although the Office is not directly responsible for the operations of the nuclear-detection system or reactions to detection by law-enforcement and other organizations, its efforts can materially affect what is feasible and achievable in both.</p>
<p>Adding to these challenges, DNDO must be concerned about the near, mid, and long term threats, which implies the need to invest in a mixture of R&amp;D activities to develop new systems, including potentially game-changing (transformational) systems, acquisition, and the engineering and honing of current capabilities. Given this diversity of responsibilities, DNDO's strategic planning is ultimately a challenging example of portfolio management: how best can it "balance" its activities so as to address all responsibilities appropriately, while exploiting all of the instruments available to it?<br /><br />DNDO is currently rethinking the answers to this question as part of a normal review, beginning with assessing the systems of systems that would be used to protect the global supply chain. These systems include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>1. The Materials Protection Control and Accounting (MPC&amp;A) program managed by the Department of Energy,</p>
<p>2. The Second Line of Defense Program (SLD), including the Megaports Program, managed by the Department of Energy,</p>
<p>3. The Container Security Initiative program operated by the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) component of the Department of Homeland Security,</p>
<p>4. The Radiation Portal Monitoring System operated by CBP, and</p>
<p>5. The Preventative Rad/Nuc Detection (PRND) program operated by the several state and local law enforcement organizations</p>

<DESC><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: </strong>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. NO award will be made as a result of this request. This request for information (RFI) is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has identified the need to improve the overall process for the development of requirements for software systems supporting the processing of patent and trademark applications. The USPTO is seeking customized training for its employees, including those within the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) as well as those employees within other business units of the USPTO. The USPTO has determined that its approach to requirements shall be based on the principles outlined in the book Software Requirements, 2nd ed., by Karl Wiegers (hereinafter referred to as the "Wiegers" approach or methodology). The USPTO has already trained some employees on the Wiegers approach.</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong> The USPTO has determined that additional training is needed for its employees involved in the development of software systems. Based on its past experience with requirements training, the USPTO has determined that providing a generic, "out-of-the-box" course to its employees is not effective. Instead, the USPTO has determined that the following customized approach would meet the training needs of its employees. In phase 1, a company providing the training will assess the training needs of the employees in the group to be trained as well as the current approach to requirements in the USPTO organizations from which these employees come. The contractor will provide a customized training workshop plan for the group to be trained. In phase 2, the contractor will provide training workshops that use specific USPTO projects as the basis for exercises in the workshops. In phase 3, the contractor will provide assistance to the workshop attendees in applying the skills from the workshop in real-world situations. In other words, the contractor will provide personnel who will act as a coach/mentor to the workshop attendees in order to assure that the workshop attendees have fully understood the training course and can apply the training. All phase 2 customized training workshops would be held at the USPTO's Alexandria, VA campus. Given the USPTO's choice of a particular approach to requirements and its specified format for the training, a contractor would need specialized skills in order to provide the customized training and any proposed contractor employee would be expected to have the skills to perform all phases of the requirements training to maintain continuity in working with the students. Any contractor would need to have staff licensed to teach the Wiegers methodology in its training courses and would need to have demonstrated experience in diagnosing the needs of the students and tailoring course materials to those needs. Second, any contractor would need to have staff with industry and/or government experience in developing software requirements using the Wiegers methodology, industry and/or government experience in teaching the Wiegers methodology, and the ability to add specific skills appropriate to each group's requirements. This combination of practical development experience and teaching experience is necessary in order for any contractor to effectively act as a coach/mentor to USPTO employees during phase 3 of the training to ensure the students can effectively implement the methodology in the student's project environment.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain comments, questions, and information regarding the implementation of the USPTO's requirements engineering training program. The USPTO is particularly interested in identifying companies capable of providing the services outlined above. From such a contractor, the USPTO is interested in an explanation of: (1) the contractor's past experience in providing customized training as outlined above to government and/or corporations; (2) the identification of contractor resources, including qualifications of proposed personnel and licenses to teach the Wiegers methodology; and (3) a brief explanation of the relevant work/teaching experience of the contractor and its qualified employee(s), (4) respondents' DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g.,small business, 8(a), HUBZone, etc) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code(s); (5) contract vehicles and (6) any other information that may be helpful in developing or finalizing the USPTO's acquisition requirements. This is NOT a Request for Proposal. Companies who desire to participate in this market survey are encouraged to submit all questions, comments, and information to satisfy the statement of OBJECTIVES.</p>
<p>All information should be submitted as a pdf file attached to an email addressed to the following email address: Requirements.Training.Program@uspto.gov. All submissions are limited to fifteen (15) pages. The contractor shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research. All requests for further information must be made in writing or via email; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. The government will review RFI submissions as they are received. The government reserves the right to close this RFI once they have received adequate response(s) to this RFI.</p>

<p>Requirement</p>
<p>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Roxbury, Massachusetts that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 10,240 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 8,905 contiguous ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (ABOAF).  The lease term requirement is for ten (10) years.  The space must be available for occupancy by October 1, 2010.  The delineated area is bounded on the North by Melnea Cass Blbd., on the West by New Tremont Street-Columbus Ave., on the South by Cedar St., and on the East by Washington St..</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Please send expressions of interest to</p>
<p>Jones Lang LaSalle Americas, Inc.<br />Brian Knies<br />601 Lexington Avenue<br />New York, NY 10022<br />212-812-5700<br />Brian.knies@am.jll.com</p>

<p>- Building name and address and location of the available space within the building;<br />- Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced;<br />- ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (ABOAF) to be offered and expected rental rate per ABOAF, fully serviced.  Indicate whether or not quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvement and state the amount, if any;<br />- Date of space availability;<br />- Method of rentable space measurement;<br />- Building ownership information;<br />- Amount of parking available on site and its cost.  Include whether expected rental rates include the cost of the required Government parking, if any;<br />- Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building; and<br />- List of building services provided.</p>
<p>The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.</p>

<DESC>The New Orleans District intends to award Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) a Sole Source, Firm-Fixed Price purchase order for statistical analyses of fisheries-independent data collected by the LDWF for the region influenced by the MRGO Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Study - Violet Freshwater Diversion Project.<BR><BR>The LDWF will relate the physical-chemical (i.e., water quality) and habitat (e.g., water flow, elevation) changes caused by the diversion to responses in the distribution, abundance and/or biomass of 15 commercially and recreationally important species in the region (e.g., brown and white shrimp, blue crab, oysters, red drum, spotted seatrout), as well as to the overall finfish-shellfish community structure of the region.  A suite of statistical methods and models that relate the diversion effects to population and community responses will be constructed and evaluated using all available data, including but not limited to: simple and multiple linear and nonlinear regression, multivariate analysis of variance or multi-response permutation procedures, canonical correspondence analysis, and spatial characterization and correlation of species distributions to fine-scale water quality measurements taken within the region.  The multivariate analyses will assess how species composition and/or trophic structure is influenced by diversion-induced fluctuations in habitat and water quality.  The regression models will evaluate the functional relationships between the species population responses and water quality changes. Geospatial maps of species distributions and abundance changes will be developed from a geographic information system (GIS) which will illustrate region-wide spatial and temporal shifts in species abundances as a function of diversion-related changes in water quality, flow and elevation.  <BR><BR>Results from the modeling and statistical analyses will describe functional relationships among the population dynamics and physical-chemical changes caused by a freshwater diversion.  These results to inform the aquatic model Comprehensive Aquatic Systems Model (CASM), provide quantitative estimates for the aquatic model calibration and results comparison; <BR><BR><BR>Interested parties shall notify Chris Nuccio at (504) 862-2704 by COB on 07/28/2010.  It is the Government's intent not to compete this procurement due to its proprietary nature.  THIS IS A SYNOPSIS AND SOURCE FOR SOUGHT COMBINED.

This acquisition is restricted. The NAICS code is 334220.<br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire "C-Band capable receivers" manufactured by L3 Communications Telemetry East (aka Microdyne). The current inventory of the AFFTC's Microdyne DR-2000 and RCB-2000 receivers were recently procured and installed under the ARTM I&amp;S Program, but they are only capable of telemetry data reception in the L and S telemetry bands. The DR-2000 Single Channel Telemetry Receivers and RCB-2000 Dual Channel Telemetry Receivers must be modified to provide the capability of telemetry data reception in the new C-Band telemetry spectrum that resulted from the 2007 World Radio Conference (WRC07). Adding C-Band capability to these receivers will allow the AFFTC full access to all available telemetry spectrum bands. The AFFTC requirement is for the C-Band tuner to tune both C-Band RF (4400-5150 MHz) and C-Band IF (400-1150 MHz) band.
<p>Contractors interested in this requirement should submit a complete technical package, which provides clear and convincing evidence that they can meet the Government's requirement. Anticipated Award date is October 11, 2010. Responses must be received no later than (NLT) 2:00 p.m., Pacific Standard Time, 15 days from NOCA issuance. Responses should be submitted via: e-mail timothy.palen@edwards.af.mil or by faxing, Fax #: 661-277-0470 (please call and verify that I have received the fax). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all responses received. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>DO NOT SUBMIT A QUOTE AT THIS TIME. <br />Please read the ENTIRE synopsis before submitting any response.
<p>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado has a Brand Name Only requirement for the purchase of Aruba Wireless Network Access Points and Accessories. This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-44, 8 July 2010. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 423430 and the size standard is 100 employees.</p>
<p>USAFA currently uses the Air Force CITS standard Aruba wireless network components. The Aruba wireless solution is certified and accredited for use on Air Force networks. The system is dependent on using Aruba network access controllers, firewalls and encryption devices to maintain network security. Only Aruba wireless access points are accredited to work with the Aruba network controllers.</p>
<p>Failure to procure the additional access points would limit coverage to customers and degrade the academic mission of USAFA. Currently students are taking on-line classes and some departments conduct on-line testing of students. Failure to acquire new AP's will limit that capability to only present departments.</p>
<p>Delivery is to be made to IT Accountability 5136 Community Center Dr East Loading Dock at the U.S. Air Force Academy.<br />FOB: Destination.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. DO NOT SUBMIT A QUOTE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>Any offerors believing they can provide an equal product that meets all of the features and functionality of the Aruba Network Wireless Access Points and Accessories may provide evidence for consideration. Evidence must support the offeror's claim they can provide an equal product. It is the offerors responsibility to prove their product is an equal by demonstrating their product, at a minimum, has the same features and functionality of the brand name product. Providing brochures, specifications and/or quotes alone is not enough for the Government to make a decision. The offeror should provide an understandable comparison between the two products. The Government is not responsible for developing the comparison from insufficient information provided. All qualified sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by this agency. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a brand name or equal procurement can be conducted. A determination that equal products exist based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received by 12:00 pm NOON Mountain Standard Time (MST) on 19a July 2010. Responses received after this will be considered late IAW FAR 52.212-1(f) and will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis. Contractors must have a current registration with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov and with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>
<p>Questions should be addressed to the Primary POC Karen Jackson, Contract Specialist, (719) 333-4060 or sent via e-mail to karen.jackson@usafa.af.mil. Alternate POC is Nicole Baert, Contracting Officer, (719) 333-8924, nicole.baert@usafa.af.mil.</p>
<p><br />5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (Apr 2010)</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen,</p>
<p>Kim Diercks<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-9018<br />email: kim.diercks@usafa.af.mil</p>
<p>Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

4.  Authority Cited:  (Identify the statutory authority, FAR title and FAR citation permitting other than full and open competition.  It may be one of the following.)
     1  (a)  10 USC 2304(c)(1) or 41 USC 253(c)(1); FAR 6.302-1:  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements OR

5.  Reason for Authority Cited: (State why this is the only source that can provide the required supplies or services.)
     1  (a)  Services can only be provided from the original source as this is a follow-on requirement for the continued provision of highly specialized services.
     	(i)  What harm will come to the Government if desired supplies/services are not provided on time?     The Office of Law Enforcement (OLE) will be faced with dedicating additional special agents from an already depleted workforce to complete labor intensive surveillance operations during complex criminal investigations that could be otherwise captured by a remote digital video surveillance system.
	(ii)  What harm will come to the Government if desired contractor doesn't receive the award?     R4 special agents will not be able to integrate and utilize existing Sensor iCam wireless surveillance equipment that is available for short term loan through the OLE Digital Evidence Recovery and Technical Support Unit (DERTSU), a national OLE technical equipment cache, while conducting complex investigations with very specialized and unique equipment.  
6.  Actions to Increase Competition: (State what actions will be taken to increase competition before subsequent acquisition of the supplies or services is required.)     R4 OLE will continue to search for vendors meeting specific remote digital surveillance system equipment requirements and national OLE specifications for this highly specialized and unique electronic equipment.  
7.  Market Survey:  (Describe the extent of the market survey conducted to identify all qualified sources and the results thereof.  "Market Survey" is defined as those attempts you made to ascertain whether other qualified sources exist.  The survey of the market place may consist of written, telephonic, or world wide web inquiries.)     R4 OLE contacted the DERTSU in conjunction with the EPA technical equipment lab along with the U.S. Forest Service technical investigations agent as well as telephonic and world wide web searches/inquiries to identify other sources for this specialized equipment.  One other vendor was identified which is a value added customer of Sensor iCam who received their equipment from the Sensor iCam and repackages it for resale.  Sensor iCam will sell the same equipment to the government for more than a $1,500.00 discount.  
8.  Procurement History:

<DESC>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is interested in continuing data collection in the seven original locations in the National Children's Study (NCS) Vanguard Study. This study serves as a platform to test acceptability and costs of the study for use in planning the main study. This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. The purpose of this small business sources sought is to identify small business organizations with requisite qualifications to provide the services stated herein. Based on capability statements received in response to this Sources Sought Announcement this acquisition may be solicited as a 100% small business set-aside. All small business organizations (SB, 8(a), SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) are encouraged to respond to this notice. This requirement is assigned a code of 541990 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the size standard for such requirements is $7 million. 

The NCS is a longitudinal cohort study that will examine the effects of environmental influences on the health and development of approximately 100,000 children enrolled from 105 distinct geographic areas across the country to form a nationally representative sample. Environment is broadly defined to include biological, physical, chemical, and social/cultural influences on childrens health and development.  Priority outcomes include obesity, diabetes, and physical development; injuries; asthma; pregnancy-related outcomes; child development and mental health; and identifying beneficial health effects.  

The Vanguard Study was launched in 2009 at seven Centers.  The overall study design of the NCS is to enroll women who are pregnant, or likely to become pregnant, during an approximate four-year enrollment period. To be eligible the women must reside in designated geographic areas. Children enter the study when they are born to an enrolled mother.  Each child in the study will be followed from before birth until 21 years old.  Accordingly, participants enrolled in the pilot (Vanguard) cohort will continue to be followed as a pilot cohort until the child is 21 years of age. Enrollment into the pilot cohort is expected to continue through December 2011 with a goal of beginning enrollment into the main study in January 2012. The NCS Main Study has an accrual target of 100,000 children from 105 study locations.  

An early step of the original Vanguard Study includes canvassing designated neighborhoods, going door to door to identify women who are potentially eligible for enrollment.  Once a woman is identified as eligible she is invited to participate in the Study.  Women who are pregnant as well as those who have a high probability of becoming pregnant are invited to enroll in the study.  Enrolled participants are followed with a series of home and clinic based data collection visits.  Additionally women, who are not pregnant at the time of the initial household screening but have a moderate or low probability of pregnancy, are followed with phone calls from the Study Center every 3 to 6 months. 

To be deemed capable of providing the current need for the study the small business offeror must submit a written capability statement that clearly demonstrates capacity in the following areas:

1. Experience: The offeror shall demonstrate previous successful experience based on studies of the relevant size and breadth, providing specific detail related to each appropriate task.

Study visits could include collection of interview data, physical measurements, biological specimens and environmental samples. Women and children enrolled in the pilot study must be followed longitudinally to meet study goals.  The offeror should be capable of performing already scheduled data collections with participants.  Offerors must also be capable of following a large number of women by telephone to identify new pregnancies.  Once a pregnancy is identified the offeror must be capable of enrolling expectant mothers as new participants. 

5. Relationships with the community: The offeror shall demonstrate the existence or ability to rapidly form working relationships with important entities within Study Locations e.g. hospitals, providers of prenatal care and members of the community such that they (the research team) are recognized and trusted within the community.

<DESC>The National Park Service contemplates issuing a sole source award to PaperThin, Inc. for consulting and support services for their Commonspot Content Management System. To enable a closer relationship, PaperThin and NPS will enter into a more engaged Support Services relationship.
The goals for this engagement are to: Ensure that PaperThin's extensive experience and best practices are made available to NPS/DOI. Provide strategic technical consultation on architectural issues related to the inner workings/architecture of CommonSpot. Ensure that NPS/DOI utilize CommonSpot's framework to its fullest capabilities and deploy websites and applications rapidly and efficiently in a supported manner. Create a communication pipeline that allows issues/questions to be identified and resolved faster and ultimately to create a process of growth that steers the NPS/DOI CommonSpot implementation away from future issues.
The NPS currently uses PaperThin's CommonSpot software and recently began expanding use of the software for full integration of all hosted websites within the NPS framework (both public and private).  NPS requires PaperThin's unique knowledge to ensure that the NPS configuration and system architecture meet with the best practices of the product and all development work is completed in an optimal way that will meet scalability and system requirements.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.

<DESC>Authoring Instructional Materials (AIM) Program
<p>SYNOPSIS</p>
<p><br />Naval Air Warfare Systems, Orlando Training Systems Division, in support of Authoring Instructional Materials (AIM) program, intends to issue a contract modification to Columbus Technologies and Services, Inc. (CTS), under contract N61339-05-D-0026, on a sole source basis to one known responsible source who can meet the immediate requirement within an acceptable timeframe until the full scope of the requirement can be solicited competitively. This contract modification will temporarily extend the period of performance (POP) from 31 August 2010 until 31 March 2010. Although more than one source may be able to fulfill the requirement, this would create substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through a competition for the short-term extension of services. In addition, award to any other source would result in an unacceptable delay of work in fulfilling the agency's requirements. An acquisition strategy is simultaneously being developed to define the requirements for a competitive source selection. A Request for Proposals is anticipated to be issued on or about 15 September 2010.</p>
<p>This contract extension will extend the POP ensuring uninterrupted support to the AIM System Support Office (AIMSSO) for the scheduled AIM software release in August 2010, AIM Helpdesk support and AIM User Training, as well as future task orders and this will enable NAWCTSD sufficient time to recompete this requirement. Uninterrupted support to the AIM program and its user community is imperative until the recompete process is completed and transition to the newly awarded contractor occurs. The targeted award date for the recompeted contract is 4/1/2011 with a 30 day mobilization period for transition of software packages. The seven month extension of the POP will allow task orders addressing any emergent requirements to be written and will ensure proper support by the current contracted software team to the user community and AIMSSO. The ability to write task orders through 3/31/11 will also allow for planning a smooth transition to the awarded contractor as software configuration management will be a top priority in order to maintain the integrity of the AIM software code.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. While interested parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirement or submit a proposal, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responses received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be reviewed and considered by the Government. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the contracting specialist, Christina Garcia, at christina.garcia@navy.mil, or call at (407) 380-4098. Alternate point of contact (POC), Rebeca Gonzalez, at rebeca.gonzalez@navy.mil, or call at 407-380-4524.</p>

<DESC>HQ INSCOM intends to extend a firm fixed-price contract for four (4) months to Jupiter Corporation to provide adjudication support services in planning, data gathering and analysis, technical writing, graphics and production capabilities, and documentation coordination. Expected period of performance is September 1, 2010  December 31, 2010. Jupiter Corporation is performing the required services under contract number W911W4-10-P-0021, which will expire on August 31, 2010. Continuation of services by Jupiter Corporation are required, severance of the on-site contractor would impact the flow of work, requiring new staff training, DoD, Army and CCF policy familiarization. The current contractor's expertise is needed to continue the processing of Research, Recertify, and Upgrade (RRU) and Incident Reports (IR) in the Joint Personnel Adjudicative System (JPAS). The above source is deemed to be the only source available because an award to a source other than the original provider would result in a substantial duplication of cost which would not be recovered through competition. The competitive follow-on requirement is expected to be awarded on or about 15 January 2011. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The estimated value is $425,101.00. POC for this action is Charles R Dunaway, charles.dunaway@mi.army.mil,703-428-4466. Please submit responses by Wednesday, 21 July 2010 no later than 4 p.m.(EST).

If the Government determines, after evaluation of quotes that only one offeror is capable of providing the services at the level of quality required the contract will be award to that offeror. Individual awards will be for the items or combinations of items that result in the lowest aggregate cost to the Government, including the assumed administrative costs as determined by the Contracting Officer. All quotes received shall be evaluated by lowest price technically acceptable per line item. All submitted offers must annotate if their quotes can be consider in part.
<p>1) Award will be based on the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable meaning award will be made to the lowest evaluated price quotation meeting or exceeding the acceptability of standards for non-cost factors.</p>
<p>2) Initially offers shall be ranked according to price. Including any option prices if applicable. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) to confirm the extended amount for each. The extended amounts will be added together to determine the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p><br />3) After the cursory review is performed, the government will start evaluation with the lowest price offeror per CLIN, to determine technical acceptability using the submittals qualifications of the Halon Fire Extinguisher Maintenance PWS. If the lowest priced evaluated offer per CLIN is judged to be technically acceptable and is determined to be responsible, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offeror. If the lowest priced offeror per CLIN is not judged to be technically acceptable, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to be technically acceptable or until all offerors are evaluated. The Contracting Officer shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>Award Examples: <br />Example 1: <br />If contractors -A&#8214;, -B&#8214; and -C&#8214; bid on CLINs 1, 2 and 3 and contractor -C&#8214; has the lowest priced offer per CLIN and is judged to be technically acceptable and is determined to be responsible then one contract for CLINs 1, 2 and 3 will be awarded to contractor -C&#8214;. <br />Example 2: <br />If contractors -A&#8214;, -B&#8214; and -C&#8214; bid on CLINs 1, 2 and 3 and contractor -A&#8214; has the lowest priced offer per CLIN on CLINs 1 and 2 and is judged to be technically acceptable and is determined to be responsible then a contract will be awarded for CLINs 1 and 2 to contractor -A&#8214;. And if contractor -B&#8214; has the lowest priced CLIN offer on CLIN 3 and is judged to be technically acceptable and is determined to be responsible then a contract will be awarded for CLIN 3 to contractor -B&#8214;. <br />Example 3 <br />Considering contractor -A&#8214; bids on CLINs 1, 2 and 3, contractor -B&#8214; bids on CLIN 3 and contractor -C&#8214; bids on CLINs 1 and 3.

LOAD REDUCTION: &nbsp;The Federal Government will not be penalized in any way for pursuing energy conservation projects that reduce all utility load requirements. <br /><br />2.B.9. ENERGY CONSERVATION MEASURE:&nbsp; The Energy Policy Act of 1992, recent Executive Orders, and Presidential Directives require Federal agencies to meet a number of energy and water management goals, among other requirements.&nbsp; The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) supports two methods of project financing:&nbsp; Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESCs) and Super Energy Savings Performance Contracts (Super ESPCs).&nbsp; Implemented energy projects save energy, taxpayer dollars and contribute to a cleaner and safer environment. <br />a) The term Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) means any specific energy related or water service intended to provide energy savings and/or demand reduction in Federal facilities.<br />b) The term Energy Management Service (EMS) means any project that reduces and/or manages energy demand in a facility as well as energy audits and any ancillary services necessary to ensure the proper operation of the energy conservation measure.&nbsp; Such measures include, but are not limited to, operating, maintenance and commissioning services (Energy Conservation Measure and Demand Side Management Measure are considered equivalent terms). To be considered an EMS measure, the measure must satisfy all of the following requirements: <br />1) The EMS measure must produce measurable energy reductions or measurable amounts of controlled energy and/or water use;<br />2) The EMS measure must be directly related to the use of energy or directly control the use of energy or water;<br />3) The preponderance of work covered by the EMS measure (measured in dollars) must be for items 1 and 2 above; and<br />4) The EMS measure must be an improvement to real property or any action that is necessary to ensure the functionality of the EMS measure.<br />&nbsp;<br />2.B.10. RENEWABLE ENERGY REQUIREMENT of EPAct 2005 and Executive Order 13423: &nbsp;The authority for this requirement is based on Section 203, FEDERAL PURCHASE REQUIREMENT of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15852) and Executive Order 13423, Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management (72 FR 3919; January 24, 2007), and the instructions and guidance distributed by the Chairman of the Council for Environmental Quality for the implementation of the Executive Order. &nbsp;<br />Energy Policy Act of 2005: &nbsp;("EPACT 2005;" Pub. L. 109-58) requires, in part, that the President, acting through the Secretary of Energy, shall seek to ensure that, to the extent economically feasible and technically practicable, of the total amount of electric energy the Federal government consumes during any fiscal year, the following amounts shall be renewable energy: <br />a) Not less than 5 percent in fiscal years 2010 through 2012 <br />b) Not less than 7.5 percent in fiscal year 2013 and each fiscal year thereafter</p>
<p>Executive Order (EO) 13423 requires that agencies: &nbsp;Ensure that (i) at least half of the statutorily required renewable energy consumed by the agency in a fiscal year comes from new renewable sources, and (ii) to the extent feasible, the agency implements renewable energy generation projects on agency property for agency use.&nbsp; There are no geographic restrictions related to the RECs provided to meet this requirement. <br />Overview of Renewable Energy Sources and Conversion Factors:&nbsp; The EPACT 2005 and EO13423 Requirements will be based on the "total amount of electric energy the Federal government consumes during any fiscal year" for all facilities, those subject to EPACT 2005 goals and excluded, domestic and international. This is consistent with Federal energy management requirements in Title V of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act ("NECPA"; Pub. L. 95-619), which specifically apply to Federal buildings, meaning: "any building, structure, or facility, or part thereof, including the associated energy consuming support systems, which is constructed, renovated, leased, or purchased in whole or in part for use by the Federal Government and which consumes energy; such term also means a collection of such buildings, structures, or facilities and the energy consuming support systems for such collection."<br />&nbsp;<br />2.B.11. DEFINITIONS: &nbsp;All definitions are for the interpretation of this agreement: <br />i. Billing Period - A period consisting of not less than 27 days and not more than 35 days. Bills for shorter or longer periods than defined herein shall be prorated on the basis of the number of days divided by 30.<br />ii. Burner-tip - Indicates the point of use at USP Lee.<br />iii. City Gate - The point where interstate pipelines deliver gas into NGDC facilities.<br />iv.

(1)   The offeror's past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System - Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier's past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier's overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*	5.  Red:	Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier's percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

<DESC>The Navy Exchange Service Command (NEXCOM) is soliciting proposals to enter into a license agreement which the successful offeror will establish and operate a casual dining restaurant near the Navy Exchange Pearl Harbor Mall at Naval Station Pearl Harbor in Hawaii in accordance with the attached solicitation.
It is our desire to establish an agreement for a nationally known casual dining restaurant that would best complement food service alternatives in the area, considering not only the immediate market area, but the island of Oahu as a whole.  The desired restaurant will be located in an extremely high traffic area of Oahu located across the parking lot from the Navy Exchange ("the Mall"), the flag ship store in the Navy Exchange system, and the Commissary, existing retail facilities that presently generate annual sales of approximately $197 million and $91 million, respectively.  There are five million customer visits to the Mall per year, a customer base of not only Navy patrons, but 60% of which consists of Army, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard shoppers.  There is a high concentration of military housing in the area, three Navy Exchange gas stations that generate $27 million in annual sales and various high sales volume food outlets in adjacent malls (Moanaula, Pearlridge) including a Chili's and a Ruby Tuesdays.  The Navy Exchange also plans to construct and open additional retail facilities nearby in 2012, a furniture store and an auto service station, at a combined estimated cost of $55 million.

Additional FAR and DFARS clauses required by the regulations will be included.

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, has determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples. 

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>Award will be made to the offeror(s) proposing the best value to the Government considering technical capability, price, delivery and past performance. The USCG anticipates award of a firm fixed price purchase order(s). This is an unrestricted solicitation.</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.

Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>Alternate Parts will be authorized if they are an approved alternate under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) catalog system, which improves interoperability between NATO and commercial cataloging systems.

Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

<p>12. Description:</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-10-Q-200139 is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-43. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The USCG anticipates award of a firm fixed price purchase order. This is an unrestricted solicitation. The requirement consists of various spare parts that will be utilized on United States Coast Guard SRR/HH65 aircraft. They are listed on the EXCEL Spreadsheet attachment labeled "HSCG38-10-Q-200139 Line Items". This spreadsheet shall be utilized to submit your quote along with anticipated delivery timeframe.</p>
<p><br />Award will be made to the offeror(s) proposing the best value to the Government considering technical capability, price, and past performance. It is anticipated that MULTIPLE FIXED PRICE PURCHASE ORDERS will result from this solicitation.</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>Alternate Parts will be authorized if they are an approved alternate under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) catalog system, which improves interoperability between NATO and commercial cataloging systems. Alternate parts must satisfy all form, fit, and function requirements of the original parts and conform to the approved configuration of the United States Coast Guard HH-65 aircraft and be approved by USCG Engineering prior to award.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. Certificate of Conformance must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>There are multiple Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) associated with the parts contained within this solicitation. Offerors must be able to provide necessary certification including traceability to a manufacturer, manufacturer's COC, FAA 8130, and its own certificate of conformance to ensure parts are in airworthy condition, suitable for installation on U.S. Coast Guard aircraft. Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>Vendor must possess appropriate FAA certification and must be an OEM approved source. Certifications shall be required prior to award. The contractor must have access to the most current original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specifications. Drawings or specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government. Offers should indicate nomenclature, part number, unit price, and extended price, plus the FOB point, any discounts for prompt payment, business size standards, and minority classifications. Earlier deliveries are desired and will be accepted. F.O.B. Destination is requested as the F.O.B. point. Deliver to USCG Aircraft Logistics Center, Receiving Section, Bldg. 63, Elizabeth City, North Carolina, 27909-5001. Packaging, packing, and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Packaging material shall not consist of the following: popcorn, shredded paper, Styrofoam of any type, or peanut packaging. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate National Stock Number, Part Number, Nomenclature, Quantity, Purchase Order and Line Item Number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required. The internal packaging material shall be sufficient to prevent damage during shipment, handling, and storage. Each unit shall be packaged to protect against electrostatic damage. Preservation protection must be sufficient to prevent corrosion, deterioration, or decay during warehouse storage for a period of one year but no preservation coating will be applied directly to the component. Only new items are acceptable. The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this request for quotation and are incorporated by reference:</p>

<p>FULL TEXT CLAUSES<br />52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters. <br />CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010) <br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- <br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- <br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ] , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); <br />(C) Are / are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; <br />(D) Have [ ] have not [ ] within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(End of provision) <br /><br />52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items (JUN 2008)<br />52.212-2 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items. (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />Technical Capability<br />Price<br />Past Performance<br />Technical capability and price are significantly more important than past performance. Award will be granted to the offeror that provides the Best Value to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (AUG 2009). <br />ALT I (APR 2002)<br />An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) through (i) of this provision.<br />52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items (JUN 2010)</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695. <br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 23 JULY 2010, 10:00 a.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 23 JULY 2010.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />___________________________________________________________</p>

<DESC>13 July 2010:&nbsp; The purpose of this modification is to add question/answer.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; 24. Item 0007 (AMX FG2251-61RGB) is a flush-mount device, intended for wall or furniture installation; however in the drawings it is depicted as a desktop style to be placed on the lectern. Is this touch panel to be wall mounted, and if so, where?
<p>Answer: The drawing is correct in depicting a desktop type touch panel. Item 0007 should be revised to AMX F 2250-61RGB NXT-1200VG RGB KIT. Desktop design but otherwise the specs are the same.</p>

<p>PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition. The FAR Provision 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items, and 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items are incorporated by reference. The provision at 52.212-2 applies to this acquisition and is provided in full text. FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999): (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF, OR SUBMIT A WRITTEN RESPONSE TO, THE FOLLOWING TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS: The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) Understanding of the Requirement/Technical Capabilities = 40 points: The offeror shall document that they have the necessary technical capability to complete the requirements in the Statement of Work (SOW). The offeror shall be evaluated on &amp; show documentation of: (a) Staffing plan adequate to complete the requirements listed in the attached Scope of Work. (b) Licensure AND Board Certification (general radiology) and Initial Training in mammography (minimum of 3 months) (to be utilized when technology/capability is available). (c) Initial Category I Education (minimum 60 hours, 15 of these must be within the last 3 years) (d) New Mammography Modality Training (8 hrs - digital) (to be utilized when technology/capability is available). (e) Continuing Experience (3,000 General X-ray, 600 Ultrasound, 600 Mammograms, 125 CT, and 100 MRI readings during the past 12 months) (f) Continuing Education (15 Category I CMEs) (g) Radiologist(s) with experience as a Lead Radiologist for FDA/ACR accreditation activities. (h) Internal staff to conduct Medical Physicist surveys for the Review Work Station &amp; to establish local network firewalls &amp; procedures to ensure patient confidentiality &amp; security consistent with Federal requirements. Note: mammogram requirements are in place to accommodate that capability when it becomes available. (2) Past Performance = 30 points: Past performance shall be used to assess the experience &amp; quality of the offeror's past experience with the same or similar tasks in past rural orders. The offeror shall list contracts similar in complexity &amp; scope as the requirements in the SOW. The offeror shall include the following information for each contract successfully performed: (a) Name of ordering agency &amp; Contracting Officer (b) Contract number (c) Type of contract (d) Total contract value (e) Brief description of work (f) Use of technology to provide interpretations to a remotely located agency (g) Identify the contract that you consider the most successful &amp; the reason(s) for this determination ; describe process for corrective actions if problems arose; describe process for communication with the ordering agency for recommendations for improvements. (3) Cost = 30 points: The Indian Health Service will make a separate determination of price reasonableness. The primary consideration in evaluating this criterion is which offeror can perform the task in a manner most advantageous to the government. Under best value principles, there is no requirement that a task order be awarded on the basis of lowest proposed cost. The award primarily on the basis of estimated costs may encourage the submission of unrealistically low estimates and increase the likelihood of cost overruns. Estimated costs must be reasonable for the tasks to be performed. If consideration is narrowed to choosing among proposals with approximately equal technical criteria as determined by the technical evaluation, cost information can become the determining criteria. Technical Criteria will be 70% and cost will be 30% determining factors for this award. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options(s). (c) A written notice of award of acceptance or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center, 308th Air Armament Systems Wing, 308th Air Armament Systems Group, 692nd Armament Systems Squadron, intends to solicit and award multiple sole source contracts under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Raytheon Missile Systems, Tucson, AZ to procure the following efforts: <br /><br />a. Miniature Air Launched Decoy Jammer (MALD-J) Increment II risk reduction activities, prototyping and contractor competitive down-selects of a supplier for upgrades to the jammer module. The risk reduction program will develop new jammer techniques and a jam resistant Integrated Guidance and Navigation System to handle the additional jammer power output. This Technology Development Phase will include initial ground testing, captive flight testing, and a free flight demo.<br />b. MALD-J Increment II Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase (EMD). This effort further develops the Increment II concept and produces hardware for testing. During this period developmental captive and free-flight testing will occur.<br />c. Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) for MALD and MALD J, including LRIP 5, LRIP 6, and Full Rate Production (FRP) for MALD-J and MALD-J Increment II to include FRP 7 and FRP 8.<br /><br />The MALD-J is an expendable unmanned air vehicle deployed from an F-16 fighter or B-52 bomber aircraft at standoff ranges to penetrate enemy airspace to stimulate, decoy, confuse, jam and/or saturate an enemy integrated air defense system to enhance aircrew survivability during combat operations. The only known responsible source that can satisfy these requirements is Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS) the original MALD producer and sustainment provider because it solely possesses the critical vehicle information and qualified vehicle design to meet Government's requirements. No Technical data package is available from the government. FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii) requires that all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. All responses must be received 15 calendar days after date of post. The AFFARS clause 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement. The AAC Ombudsman is Colonel Charles S. Greenwald, AAC/CV, 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL 32542, (850) 882-5495, Charles.greenwald@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has a requirement for the management and operation of a correctional facility to house a population of approximately 3,000 low security adult male inmates that are primarily criminal aliens with one year or less remaining to serve on their sentence. This population is currently housed in various IGAs and MOUs throughout the Southwestern United States, concentrated primarily in Texas. The funding for this project will come from current budgeted funds expended for housing and medical care of these STS inmates in the existing IGAs and MOUs. This requirement may be fulfilled through a single award or multiple awards resulting from this solicitation. The solicitation may result in an award or awards up to approximately 3,000 beds. The BOP anticipates that each facility or complex of facilities will house a minimum of 900 beds to a maximum of 3,000 beds. The inmates shall be housed in a secure correctional institution or institutions located in the Southwestern United States. The facility(ies) must be located in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, or Arizona.
<p>Proposed institutions shall meet BOP standards as set forth in the resulting solicitation/contract. Effective at the date of NTP, offerors are prohibited from housing non-BOP inmates within the same fence perimeter; however, multiple populations at a prison complex with separate fence lines is acceptable. Shared services within each fence line is not acceptable.</p>
<p>An offeror awarded a contract must be ready to accept inmates at an existing facility within 120 days after contract award at the rate specified in the resulting contract. An existing facility is defined as an institution ready to accept inmates, or for which construction expansion began, prior to the date of this notice. Expansion of a facility or new construction of a facility initiated after the date of this notice is prohibited.</p>
<p>Potential offerors must submit all potential places of performance to be proposed to the Contracting Officer by 06/11/2010. In addition, offerors must submit a digital aerial photo of the proposed facility with their completed Intent to Propose response.</p>
<p>The BOP intends to award a firm-fixed price, Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity type contract. The Government will be required to order and the contractor required to furnish at least the established minimum quantity of 90% of the accepted number of contract beds for each contract year. Additionally, the contractor will be required to house a daily population of up to 15% over the accepted number of contract beds for each contract year. The contract award(s) will have a potential term of 10 years, consisting of one four-year base period and six one-year option periods. Contract performance will be governed by a Performance Work Statement based on the American Correctional Association/Standards for Adult Local Detention Facilities.</p>
<p>Award selection shall be made on a best value basis for the Government. The non-price evaluation factors, when conbined, are significantly less important than price. The BOP has established a decisional rule criterion requiring all offerors to clearly demonstrate they have verifiable corporate experience operating a secure correctional/detention institution for a continuous three-year period as of the date the Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued. Information will be required from offerors regarding both existing and anticipated environmental impacts and the environmental condition of the proposed site where the institution is located. Environmental documentation and other related information will be required with the submission of the proposal in order to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). A NEPA analysis will be performed for each proposed contract action. The BOP anticipates that NEPA will be satisfied through the preparation of an Environmental Assessment prior to contract award.</p>
<p>This requirement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis, open to both large and small businesses. Faith Based and Community Organizations can submit offers equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the BOP.</p>
<p>The solicitation&nbsp;posting date is&nbsp;05/21/2010, with&nbsp;the closing date for receipt of proposals on 07/30/2010. The solicitation will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunity website http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The site provides downloading instructions.

<DESC>Amendment 02
Question - Are "Primary Tasks" (A) through (G) listed in order of importance?
Answer - Primary tasks (A) through (G) are not listed in order of importance.

Question - Although geotechnical engineering services are named in the title of solicitation N62470-10-R-2039, we do not see geotechnical services listed specifically under the primary tasks anticipated for this contract.  We assume that the geotechnical services required under this contract will be associated with the other described services, such as pavement testing, civil engineering, etc.  Is this a correct assumption?
Answer - Yes, the geotechnical engineering services under this requirement are envisioned to support the civil design tasks.

Question - Evaluation Factor 1. Specialized Experience states "The Contractor shall provide a maximum of six (6) projects..." We understand that it is the Navy's intent that contractors provide only six (6) projects in SF330 Item F (unless in a Joint-Venture). However, in responding to this item in SF330 Item H, are contractors limited to only discussing those same six (6) projects, or are they allowed to present additional experience to fully address the evaluation factor? We would propose that contractors be allowed to summarize additional experience to fully convey their ability to perform the contract's wide range of services throughout the required geographic areas.
Answer - The offeror may submit under Item H any other information it deems appropriate; however, for purposes of Evaluation Factor 1 only six (6) projects will be evaluated.
 "The Contractor shall provide a maximum of six (6) projects substantially completed between June 2007 and June 2010, that best demonstrate specialized experience relevant to the work proposed under this contract; knowledge of local codes, laws, permits and construction materials and practices in the contract area; and knowledge of and extent of experience applying sustainability concepts, including low impact development and DoD criteria."
Question - Evaluation Factor 1. Specialized Experience states "For submittal purposes, each task order on an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract is considered a separate project." Would the Navy allow contractors to present either a (1) task order or (2) an IDIQ contract summary as a separate project? We have several IDIQs encompassing multiple TOs and scope items that will show our relevant experience much better than a single TO.
Answer:  An IDIQ contract summary will not be considered as a separate project.  As stated in the synopsis:  "For submittal purposes, each task order on an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract is considered a separate project."

Question - Does this include roofing and waterproofing?
Answer - No, roofing and waterproofing are not included

<DESC>Modification 0002Government Response to QuestionsSolicitation Number:  10HQ37-NoSolicitationF-Natural Resource Management-remediation Mercury Contamination
Question:
I looked over the diagrams for the stilling well.  I would like information concerning the dimensions of the stilling well and inquire to what depth they are buried.  I had called earlier and realized that I had inquired about the dimensions of the manometer and not the stilling well. Answer:
Stilling well dimensions vary but typically for this work are 4-ft by 4-ft steel-reinforced concrete or 24-inch to 48-inch diameter corrugated metal pipe structures.  The depth they are buried varies with the size of the stream drainage area.  These could be up to 20-30 ft of burial in extreme cases.
Question:I'm writing in response to USGS Solicitation Number 10HQ37 - Remediation of Mercury Contamination.  For background, GZA has gained significant experience in assessing and remediating sites impacted through the inadvertent release of mercury from manometers at compressor and metering stations along several major natural gas pipelines that transect the southern, central and north-central United States.  The number of pipeline sites we have assessed totals approximately 300.  So that we may provide you a complete capability statement and cost estimate, we would like to know approximately how many stilling well sites the USGS will address under this scope.   
Answer:
10 sites that USGS will potentially address under this scope, to include Ohio and Wyoming.
Question:Can you please let us know the addresses in Michigan for the mercury testing in wells?
Answer:

Irregular Warfare entities have become less dependent on state sponsors for logistics and operational expenses and more dependent on loosely formed, often trans-regional networks which provide lines of communication, fighters, funding, equipment, training, and safe havens that are both trans-regional and regional in nature.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL TO PROCURE 
USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Based on the following justification, the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action is hereby approved pursuant to authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(C)(1) under FAR 6.302-1. 


Justification

1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity  

AGENCY:
Dept of Veterans Affairs Medical Center
Battle Creek VA Medical Center
5500 Armstrong Rd
Battle Creek, MI 49015

CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:
Dept of Veterans Affairs Medical Center (90CSC)
2669 Cold Spring Road; Indianapolis, IN 46222


2.	Nature/Description of Action

This action being approved is for the implementation of the initiative to eliminate homelessness among the veteran population.  The Homeless Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program provides residential treatment services that address the causes and effects of homelessness in a community based setting.  The community based setting provides a safe, sober environment, which supports recovery and meets the needs of homeless veterans.

This document sets forth the justification and acceptance approval for one of the exceptions to full and open competition allowed under Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1(a)(2).

3.	Description of Supplies/Services

The Battle Creek Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center requires residential treatment services that address the causes and effects of homelessness in a community-based setting in an 18-bed facility provided by Volunteers of America-Michigan in the Berrien, Cass, and Van Buren Counties. The existing contractor can no longer provide the needed services and VOAMI has agreed to purchase all the assets from the existing contractor in order to relieve that contractor of their obligation to the Government.  

Requirements include provision of direct services in a safe, sober environment, which supports recovery and meets the needs of homeless veterans.  The Battle Creek Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center expects Volunteers of America-Michigan to provide services which include the following basic residential services:

     	(1)  A supervised environment which will be staffed on a 24-hour basis;

     	(2)  Room and board;

     	(3)  Laundry facilities available for residents to do their own laundry; and

  Required Therapeutic and Rehabilitative Services include:

(1)  Structured activities; i.e., resident participation in group sessions dependent upon resident preference and the VA case manager and residential treatment setting staff recommendations;

(2)  A variety of group activities, including physical activities, as appropriate;

(3)  Health and personal hygiene counseling;

(4)  Monitoring of medications;

(5)  Supportive social service, in collaboration with the case managers, VA or other community resources;

 (6)  Professional counseling as required, including emphasis on self care skills, adaptive coping skills and, as appropriate, vocational counseling, in collaboration with VA or community resources;

 (7)  Opportunities for immediate learning and/or development of independent living skills with a goal of achieving a more adaptive level of psychosocial functioning;

(8)  Support for an alcohol and/or drug-free lifestyle; and

(9)  Opportunities for learning, and internalizing knowledge of the illness and/or recovery process;

(10)  Improving social skills and improving personal relationships.

4.	Identification of Statutory Authority

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(C)(1).

5.	Demonstration of Contractors Unique Qualifications

The existing contractor can no longer provide the needed services and VOAMI has agreed to purchase all the assets from the existing contractor in order to relieve that contractor of their obligation to the Government.  The proposed contractor is the only residential treatment program that is geographically located to purchase the existing contractor's assets which ensures a seamless transition to the veteran clients that are currently residing at that facility; they are the only contractor that is able to continue the current services that the veteran clients are currently involved with; and they are the only contractor capable to provide fee basis services to veteran clients referred by VA in BERRIEN COUNTY/NILES, MICHIGAN AND SURROUNDING AREAS.  

Continuity of care is top priority to the veteran clients that are currently residing at this facility, and is critical to their success.  In addition, VOAMI has shown the ability to work and understand the veteran population in the Berrien, Cass, Van Buren and surrounding Counties.  They have specific expertise in areas of residential services to the homeless Veteran population. 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure a Variety of Potential Sources

A market survey was not conducted in this instance due to the circumstances of the existing vendor's situation.  The ongoing therapeutic relationship between the existing contractor and the veteran clients is critical; VOAMI has agreed to purchase the assets of the existing contractor and maintain the current therapeutic relationship to ensure a seamless transition for the veterans.  In the interest of the veteran clients continuity of care is critical for their success in the program.  VOAMI is the only contractor in this geographical area that is able to provide and maintain the continuing care of the veterans without having to relocate them.

The existing contractor can no longer provide the needed services and VOAMI has agreed to purchase all the assets from the existing contractor in order to relieve that contractor of their obligation to the Government.  Continuity of care is critical to the success of our veteran clients; this provider is able to ensure continuity of care with the given circumstances.  In addition, this provider has shown the ability to work and understand the veteran population served with specific expertise in areas of residential services to the homeless Veteran population.

<AWARDEE>SAIC-Frederick, Inc., Miller Drive, Bldg. 428, Frederick, MD 21702-1012 US
<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION: This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars and is awarded under Contract No. HHSN261200800001E with SAIC-Frederick, Inc., the Operations and Technical Support contract for NCI-Frederick. The Contractor's DUNS number is 159990456.
<p>The purpose of this action is to fund the following ARRA project:</p>
<p>Janus Infrastructure Development and Implementation for the FDA - Collaboratively build and use the standards, infrastructure, tools and policies needed for FDA to receive, process and analyze data in a standardized electronic format, including analyses across multiple studies.</p>
<p>Justification for Non-Fixed Price Type of Award: This award is priced as an "Other Than Fixed Price" action. Work assigned to SAIC-Frederick, Inc. is pursuant to the terms and conditions of Contract No. HHSN261200800001E, a cost-plus-award-fee prime contract for operations and technical support to the NCI-Frederick. The use of a separate fixed price award to SAIC-Frederick, Inc. is not appropriate because this is Research and Development work issued under an existing cost reimbursement contract.</p>
<p>Justification for Noncompetitive Award: This ARRA funded award is being made as a within scope modification to an existing contract awarded noncompetitively to SAIC-Frederick, Inc. pursuant to a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition signed by the DHHS Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Management and Policy on January 17, 2007.</p>
