The language of the exclusion is included in the attachment.</p>
<p>NC3A is serving as the NATO procurement agency for this project, which is being funded within the framework of the Infrastructure Committee. NC3A has been authorized to use the one step/one envelope International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure. The successful bid pursuant to this IFB will be that bid that is the lowest price, technically compliant bid, in accordance with the evaluation criteria.<br /><br />The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-12870-NEDS and all correspondence concerning this IFB should reference this number.

Bidders may decline to do so, withdraw their bid, and excuse themselves without penalty.</p>
<p>The successful bidder will be required to handle and store classified information up to the level of NATO SECRET and only companies maintaining the appropriate facility clearance will be eligible to bid on this project. In addition, contractor personnel visiting or working on operational sites will be required to hold individual security clearances of at least NATO SECRET. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the NATO contracting agency the NATO clearance certifications needed for performance of the contract.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for a NATO ICB procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Acquisition and Assistance Field Branch (Pittsburgh), Post Office Box 18070, Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA, 15236-0070, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to 3dMD, LLC, 100 Galleria Parkway, Atlanta, GA 30339 for NOTICE OF for 3-D Scanning System.
<p>3dMD is unique in the field of ultra-fast 3D surface image capture and analysis for human subjects by virtue of: I ) Lighting -3dMD's image reconstruction technique reliably ensures quality geometry regardless of room lighting conditions or intense directional and/or reflected light. The image capture process is robust enough to work indoors or outside, including direct sunlight. Other 3D capture technologies must have "studio-like" conditions (blue-screen backgrounds, special lighting, sensitive mirrors, distance calculators, etc.) for equipment that is not meant to be used in high-throughput environments such as required by the CDC project. 3dMD9s cameras can be used in rugged, third-world environments and transported as checked airline luggage in regular suitcases. 2) Modularity and flexibility - While 3dMD manufactures a range of anatomy-specific imaging systems (i.e. 3dMDcranial System), each 3dMD system is constructed from a foundation of modular imaging components that serve as portable building blocks. This not only provides an easy upgrade path for adding components to increase capture volume, it also gives the user complete flexibility by quickly moving the components to reconfigure the capture volume for a wide range of standard and custom anatomical requirements. This "building block" approach enables easy on-site changes without sacrificing accuracy (10.2 mm) or the ability to keep common data sets across a research team. This is especially important if CDC will be working in concert with other government agencies and projects. 3) Proven Reliability and optimized workflow- With hundreds of global customers, 3dMD has been continuously developing and refining its sophisticated 3D technology products for 12- plus years. 3dMD9s systems are the most widely used ultrafast, high-precision 3D surface imaging devices in leading teaching institutions, hospitals and private practices worldwide and have an outstanding reputation for accuracy, speed, and dependability. Recognized for its commitment to scientific innovations in the field, 3dMD continues to provide advanced imaging systems to customers that are simple to use and reliable enough to withstand the pressures of imaging large numbers of patients in busy work environments day in and day out. 3dMD only utilizes medical quality machine vision photo sensors to ensure reliability, consistency and fidelity of its output images. 4) Compatibility, the 3dMDcranial system is fully compatible with other 3dMDcranial systems in use and also with a wide range of application software. 3dMD has an exclusive strategic relationship with Materialise who supply software which is widely used throughout the academic world ensuring that both companies are committed to cross support of each other's technologies. 3dMD also supplies the 3dMDvultus software developed in conjunction with leading clinical experts which has unique functionality important to these projects. 3dMDvultus requires highly accurate 3D surface images which are only available from 3dMDface or 3dMDcranial systems. 5) This system will be used to collect 3-D scan data for the project titled "Frequency of Fit Testing". In this project, face size and shape of 220 subjects will be monitored for a period of three years and respirator fit changes will be measured. Facial dimensions will be measured with traditional tools, however, inter- and intra-measurer errors are typical larger than 1 mm, i.e., 2-3 mm. There are other scanners available such as the Cyber ware head scanner. However, the cameras of that scanner rotate around the subject and a small movement from the subject can cause up to 2 cm gap in the scan data. The Cyber ware head scanner doesn't capture the chin and back of the head well. It is important to detect facial changes as small as less than 1 mm. The chin has been identified as an important site for respirator leakage. The 3dMD is the only system that meets these strict requirements we need for our project to capture mini scale size changes to face size and shape, including the back of the head.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to GLORIA GRUBER, Reference Number 000HCCLG-2009-69882, Phone Number 412-386-4967, Fax 412-386-6843, E-Mail ggruber@cdc.gov,</p>
<p>All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with 3dMD, LLC ,100 Galleria Parkway Atlanta, GA 30339 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.2.4 and AMS Policy 3.2.1.2.1 - this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors.

It is contemplated that this requirement will be competed under full and open competitive procedures.  The anticipated contract period is three (3) years, a base year with two one-year option periods.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

PURPOSE:

The FAA requires copies of certification letters for interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

c.	Demonstrate experience/capability for the requirements and each of the tasks in the attached Statement of Work (SOW).  
	d.	Respondent's access to additional resources, skills, subcontractors, etc, if necessary to perform the contract.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for national maintenance services and logistics support of the Integrated Communications Switching Systems (ICSS), Rapid Deployment Voice Switching Systems (RDVS), Enhanced Terminal Voice Switch (ETVS), Small Tower Voice Switch (STVS), the Digital Voice Recording System (DVRS) and associated Administrative Telephone Systems (ATS).
The full scope of the maintenance contract include requirements for logistics and component repair service; provisions for consumable items and materials; exchange and repair services; test bed systems; maintenance engineering services; system moves/changes/and relocation tasks; system position expansion tasks; and system functional enhancement tasks.
The ICSS and RDVS, initially manufactured by Litton-Amecom, Inc., and Denro, Inc., provide voice communications switching in Air Traffic Control Facilities and Automated Flight Service Station facilities. These systems also provide voice communications among flight service specialists, air traffic controllers and aircraft.  Further clarifications of these services are detailed in the attached Statement of Work (SOW).
Both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of this equipment, Litton-Amecom and Denro Systems, are now subsidiaries of Northrop Grumman.  As the successor OEM, Northrop Grumman maintains proprietary rights to hardware/software design, firmware and drawings required to properly fulfill this requirement.  Potential sources must provide documentation to the FAA showing that their company is capable of providing maintenance services for these Northrop Grumman proprietary systems.
The current maintenance contract ends March 26, 2010.  The period of performance for the new contract contemplated in this market survey will be March 27, 2010 through March 26, 2011 with four (4) additional one year options.  The total potential value of this award (to include all option years) is approximately $30,000,000.00

<DESC>Scope of Work:  Project to treat exotic, invasive plants in the Swanson Oil and Gas FieldBackground:  There are now 110 exotic plant species recorded on the Kenai Peninsula, of which 43 are considered invasive and 63 occur on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge.  A survey by Refuge staff on 29-31 August 2007 revealed at least 32 exotic plant species growing on pads, roads, tank settings, and right-of-way corridors within the Swanson Oil and Gas Unit.  As many as 14 different exotic plant species occurred on some pads.  Observations of yellow sweetclover, common tansy, and cattail within the Swanson Unit are the first and only sightings of these species on the Refuge.  In addition, two hawkweed species (Hieracium caespitosum, Hieracium umbellatum) found within the Swanson Unit are particularly aggressive invaders and appear to be spreading from the northernmost pads including the area of planned access for the East Satellite project. White sweet clover (Melilotus alba), another aggressive invader which is being dispersed throughout Alaska by vehicle tires, is well distributed within the Unit.  Reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea), which potentially threatens the Swanson River, also occurs at several sites within the Unit. There is a small window of opportunity to control and perhaps even eliminate these species from the Unit through the use of herbicides and better management practices.
Proposed treatments:  There are at least 175 acres on 60 pads that are infested with hawkweeds, white and yellow sweetclover, and reed canary grass.  In addition, there are several infestations along access roads and power lines outside the pads themselves, including at least 5 acres of reed canary grass distributed in seven colonies.  The most comprehensive approach is to visit and treat infested areas of all 60 pads and the roads that connect them for a period of two years and a third only applying foliar products.  This scope of work addresses only the first year (2009).
Herbicides to be used include Roundpro to treat reed canary grass on approximately 15 acres; Transline as a foliar application to treat hawkweeds and sweet clover on approximately 120 acres; and Casoron on approximately 40 acres as a pre- emergent applied in the spring before plant green up and seed germination (see attached table for application rates).   Other chemicals may be considered as warranted.
The herbicides will be applied with a surfactant or carrier to help the herbicides to set and penetrate the stem and leaf surface.  The pads will be graded as early in May as possible in order to apply the pre- emergent so the product can break down and set; the pads may also have to be watered down after the pre-emergent is applied to prevent run-off.   In June or July, the hawkweeds will be treated with a foliar application which also acts as a post and pre-emergent.  The reed canary grass will be foliar treated in spring and weed wacked and foliar application in the fall. The white sweet clover will be treated in May through September with both post and pre-emergent. 
Responsibilities:  The contractor will be certified by the State of Alaska (DEC) as a pesticide applicator. The contractor will be responsible for preparing, transporting, and storing and applying all chemicals.  The contractor will provide their own application equipment including backpack sprayers, holding tanks, and appropriate safety equipment.  All treatments will be applied in a timely way and in coordination with appropriate staff at the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge (KENWR).   KENWR will be responsible for pre- and post-treatment monitoring to assess efficacy.  

Table 1.  Four EPA-registered berbicides and two surfactant proposed for use on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge.  A target species refers to a plant species of competing vegetation that is controlled in favor of desired species. A non-target species refers to any plant, animal, or organism that a method of application is not aimed at, but may accidentally be injured by the application.

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal(RFP) for development of a conceptual telescope design to meet the requirements of theJoint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM).  The JDEM is a space-based, medium aperture, widefield, optical telescope with visible and near-infrared (NIR) imaging and spectroscopyusing HgCdTe detectors.  JDEM will survey the sky to accurately measure the magnitude and redshift of a largesample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), spectroscopic redshifts of a large sample ofgalaxies for Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) studies, and accurate shape parameters andphotometric redshift measurements of a large sample of galaxies for Weak Lensing (WL)studies.	The Telescope Assembly portion of the observatory is expected to be a Three MirrorAnastigmat (TMA) with multiple tertiary mirrors that will provide the optical train tothe Government developed JDEM instrument.  The JDEM telescope is expected to have aprimary mirror size of 1.5 meters in diameter and operate at a temperature of less than243 Kelvin.  The JDEM observatory is expected to be launched aboard a NASA provided EELVto an orbit around the Sun-Earth second Lagrange point (L2) and operate for a minimum of5 years.	NASA contemplates evaluating and selecting multiple offers (approximately 2) based on theproposals as submitted and providing each of the study participants a not to exceed costof $400K for a five month study.  This study activity is intended to determine feasibletelescope concepts based on the preliminary requirements.  The study will assess thecritical thermal, optical, mechanical and dynamic environments that drive the performanceof the JDEM telescope, as well as the critical cost, schedule and technical performancedrivers.  NASA will provide preliminary mathematical models of the spacecraft andinstrument for use by the study participants in the development of integrated models oftheir telescope conceptual designs.  The models will provide preliminary information onspacecraft and instrument interfaces and forcing functions, including mechanical,thermal, optical and dynamic considerations.  The study will also request results oftrade studies performed in the course of the study, the results of integrated modelingperformed for the proposed design concept, and a description of the telescope integrationand test flow along with a recommended optical test flow at temperature.  Cost andschedule estimates for the design, build and test of the JDEM telescope will also begenerated.  It is anticipated that the information relative to this concept study,including a draft Statement of Work, will be posted to the JDEM website athttp://jdem.gsfc.nasa.gov.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541330 and 500, respectively.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about July 1, 2009 with an anticipatedoffer due date of on or about July 31, 2009.An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over theInternet.

<DESC>RECOVERY   PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE

THIS PROJECT IS BEING FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009. This pre-solicitation notice is hereby issued in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.704. 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) Micro Milling Machines. Micro Milling machines are high performance CNC machine tools that are optimized to fabricate small scale high precision parts. Micro machine tools are based on the concept that small high precision parts should be machined on small high performance machine tools. 

The Fabrication Technology Division (FTD) of NIST depends upon a number of machining processes to competitively create products designed by NIST research staff. A machine tool, the piece of equipment used for mechanical machining, is a flexible device that is capable of creating a wide range of parts from metal, plastic, glass, composites, ceramics and other materials. Modern CNC machine tools are sophisticated, servo-motor driven, computer controlled devices that can operate in a fully-automated manner. Our existing CNC machine tools are too large, and too inflexible for adequately being able to handle micro-scale part machining and micro-scale cutting tools. Micro-scale parts are only a few millimeters across and thus scale poorly with the large working volumes of our traditional milling machines. Micro scale manufacturing machines are designed to fabricate small scale parts that require positional accuracy of ~ 2 microns and have dimensional feature sizes of <=.06mm.
The current technology of micro milling machines available in the industry are a better solutions for many micro machining applications and successfully fabricate small high precision parts from a wide range of materials ranging from plastics, metals, glass, and ceramics. They have shown to be a cost effective solution for both prototyping a high volume applications.

With this new machining technology FTD will be able to support the research developments in Nanomanufacturing and work in the Advance Metrology Laboratory (AML), which requires the fabrication of precision instruments and devices with dimensional feature sizes of less than or equal to 0.06mm (0.00236).  Over the past year, FTD has received a numerous requests from AML research staff to fabricate micro sized components that exceed the capabilities of their current CNC machining centers.  CNC Micro-Milling machines would enable the shops to fabricate ultra precision parts in the Main Shop and the AML Contact Shop requiring +/- 0.0005mm positioning accuracy. 

The Fabrication Technology Division (FTD) provides a wide range of engineering, fabrication and technical services to support the creation of unique measurement instruments and scientific apparatus needed by researchers in the NIST's Measurement and Standards Laboratories. FTD provides the mission critical engineering and manufacturing expertise and equipment needed to produce specialized parts and subassemblies for the extraordinary variety of one-of-a-kind instruments conceived by NIST scientists and engineers. 

FTDs primary line of service is metal fabrication, mechanical engineering, and electromechanical assembly. This service is used to engineer and fabricate high precision components and assemblies for use in one-of-a-kind measurement instruments conceived by NIST scientist and engineers.  FTD depends on its installed base of manufacturing technology to support the many service needs of its customers. This manufacturing technology base includes a full family of automated and conventional milling machines, lathes, grinders, electrical discharge machines, boring mills and other related manufacturing equipment. This acquisition is necessary to support research developments associated with the Enhancing Manufacturing Competitiveness initiative and various Nanomanufacturing research activities in the Advance Metrology Laboratory, which requires the fabrication of precision instruments and devices with dimensional feature sizes of less than 0.06mm (0.00236). 

Delivery terms shall be FOB DESTINATION.  The delivery schedule shall be stated in the request for quotation.  

The NAICS code for this requirement is 333512 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is being procured using full & open competition.  This requirement is not set-aside for small business.

Simplified Acquisition Procedures shall be utilized under the authority of FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.

One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.

Potential Offerors will be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related Amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted.  It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each potential Offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solicitation; the Government will not be maintaining a mailing list.  Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to todd.hill@nist.gov, and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.

<DESC>Introduction

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.   The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases has an interest in identifying innovative approaches to effectively treat bacterial infections with antimicrobials that minimize the development of drug resistance.

Description 

This BAA targets infectious diseases where improved treatment strategies could reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance and preserve the effectiveness of existing antimicrobials.  A central goal of this solicitation is to target disease areas experiencing the greatest antimicrobial selective pressure, and within these areas, develop strategies that test the safety and effectiveness of different therapeutic approaches/regimens that reduce the probability of the emergence of drug resistance by minimizing unnecessary drug exposure.

Contracts to be awarded under this BAA will support the design and conduct of Phase III and/or Phase IV clinical trials of new strategies for the use of licensed, off-patent antimicrobial therapies to reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance in selected infectious diseases.  

For the purposes of this BAA, the disease areas that may be supported under this BAA are limited to the following:

	Acute otitis media
	Pneumonia
	Bacteremia

Both community-associated and hospital-associated infections in these disease areas are eligible.

Eligible strategies may include, but are not limited to:

	Different dosage or frequency, supported by PK/PD data, where optimal treatment is well defined, e.g., the use of penicillin in penicillin-resistant  pneumonia; or
	Withholding of antimicrobials (altogether) for certain diseases and identifying eligible populations for this type of strategy; or
	Shorter treatment duration for the disease areas listed above.

It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about June 30, 2010.    

The NIAID estimates that the total cost (direct and indirect costs combined) for a single award is approximately $20 million.  However, it is anticipated that the total cost for the award(s) may vary depending upon the scope of the project and the technical objectives of the award(s).  The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research.  In no event shall the period of performance proposed by an offeror exceed five (5) years.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.   This BAA will be available electronically on/about June 30, 2009 and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fbo.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC><p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) seeks to procure on a sole source basis the QIAxel multicapillary electrophoresis system with QIAGEN Inc., 27220 Turnberry Lane, Suite 200, Valencia, CA 91355. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.5 01-(a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items. The North American Industry Classification System Code for this acquisition is 333298 and the business size standard is 500 employees. <br />The NINDS Neural Coding and Computation Section (NCC) is in need of an automated electrophoresis system for analyzing DNA fragments from restriction digest and PCR reactions for plasmid construction, as well as genotype verification. The QIAxcell is a multicapillary electrophoresis system which uses the QIAxcel analyzer, a unique multiplexed fluorescence detection design including an array of light-emitting diodes and micro-optical collectors, QIAxcel Gel Cartridges, BioCalculator software, and a computer. The QIAxcel's high detection sensitivity down to 3-5 bp for fragments smaller than 0.5 kb allows more accurate results and higher confidence in data detection compared to conventional slab gel methods. Sample consumption of less than 0.1 ul per analysis saves precious sample for further downstream analysis. QIAxcel system can allow cartridges to be used for up to 6 months; up to 96 samples can be analyzed in parallel. The QIAxcel system speeds up DNA and RNA analysis applications by eliminating slab-gel analysis while streamlining entire sample purification and analysis workflow. QIAxcel instrument was previously known as eGene and has been successfully used by many laboratories at the NIH. <br />In order to maintain compatibility with ongoing studies/experiments, it is crucial for the NINDS-NCC to acquire the QIAxcel system which is available only through QIAxcel Inc. <br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NINDS to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

The Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be issued in August 2009.  The solicitation will close and Bids will be opened in September 2009.
A contract will be awarded in accordance with FAR Parts 14 & 36, Sealed Bid Selection procedure.  This solicitation will be issued as N40085-09-B-7041.  This solicitation is 100% SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.

Project Description: The contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, materials, equipment, tools, parts, supplies and transportation necessary to abate an environmental hazard in Building 448, Naval Base New London, Groton, CT, caused by the asbestos containing spray-on fireproofing. The project also repairs or replaces components of the HVAC system, installs a fire sprinkler system, replaces suspended ceilings and light fixtures removed during the asbestos abatement, installation of fire sprinklers, building roof replacement and interior painting. This project involves the abatement of asbestos containing spray-on fireproofing materials that have been applied to structural steel. Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) components including air handling units, coils, piping, ducts, controls, and circulating pumps will be replaced or repaired. A fire sprinkler system will be installed in the section of the building that was constructed in 1971. The entire building roof will be replaced. Suspended ceilings and light fixtures required to be removed for asbestos abatement shall be replaced and interior painting performed. The project may also include: interior space renovations, interior demolition, and installation of fire alarm systems.Building 448 is a four story building constructed in 1971. A three story addition was added in 1979 increasing the building space to 61,745 sf. The structural steel in the original four story section of the building was coated with a sprayed on fire proofing material which contained asbestos. When the addition to building 448 was built in 1979 it included a fire sprinkler system.Although predominately intact and undamaged, the asbestos fire proofing material does release enough material to accumulate fibrous asbestos dust on the suspended ceiling system. Access to spaces above the suspended ceiling is restricted due to the potential to encounter asbestos containing materials. Approximately 73% of the HVAC system is comprised of original components from 1971 and1979. These HVAC components are either at the end of their service life. A 2002 HVAC study recommended the replacement of: three major air handling units, chilled water pumps, piping, controls, air cooled chiller, ductwork, high velocity reheat boxes, and electrical wiring.  The built up roofing is missing aggregate in sections which exposes the roofing surface.  Sections of the roof and flashing have blisters, holes and tears which allow water penetration. Water from roof leaks has damaged ceiling tiles. Roofing materials appear to be original from initial construction. The roofing materials may contain asbestos. An asbestos survey of the building has been performed.There will be one option which will consist of upgrading electrical systems.  This shall include the demolition and replacement of the electrical distribution system, main switchboard, interior distribution transformers, panel boards, receptacles, lightning protection system and wiring, and empty conduit system for communication drops for NMCI, Niprnet, Siprnet and a CCTV system for exterior doors on the SCIF floor.All work must be completed and ready for use not later than 480 calendar days after notice to proceed.The total price magnitude is estimated to be more than $10,000,000.00.The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is 236220 with a size standard of $33.5M.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) will utilize other than full and open competition to award a contract for production, integration, testing and engineering support services for the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar transmitter group and Missile Fire Control System (MFCS) MK 99 for DDG 113-115 to Raytheon Company, Integrated Defense Systems (Raytheon IDS) in Tewksbury, MA. The Government anticipates procuring DDG 113-related long lead material and other non-recurring engineering (NRE) efforts in FY09. Options for DDG 113 equipment procurement in FY10 and DDG 114-115 equipment procurements in FY11 will be executed as separately priced options.
Raytheon IDS will be responsible for the production and test of the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar transmitter group, which consists of RF driver and amplification cabinets, a RF monitoring cabinet, high voltage power supplies and isotransformers. In order to test and deliver a fully integrated MFCS MK 99, Raytheon will design and manufacture the MFCS MK99 CWI elements, which consist of MK 82 Director antennas, waveguide elements between the transmitter and antenna, and a data conversion cabinet, and integrate the MFCS elements that are delivered under separate contracts (e.g., MK 82 Director/MK 200 Director Controller). Raytheon will also be responsible for testing of the fully integrated MFCS MK99. If all options are exercised, the maximum quantities procured will be three AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar transmitter groups and three MFCS MK 99 shipsets.
After production, the Radar transmitter group and MFCS MK 99 will be shipped to the Production Test Center (PTC) in Moorestown, NJ for integration with the remainder of the Aegis Weapon System (AWS) and system level testing by Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems and Sensors (LM MS2). Raytheon IDS will be responsible for providing technical and engineering services at the PTC during integration and test, and at shipyards during construction or as a result of sea trials and other relevant special studies. 
Raytheon IDS is the only existing source with the in-depth technical expertise, knowledge, resources and infrastructure required to produce the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar transmitter group and MFCS MK 99 without adverse impact to the USN shipbuilding and ship deployment requirements. Raytheon IDS has been the prime production contractor for the AN/SPY-1 transmitter group since the first contract was awarded for the AWS effort in 1969.  They have also been the principal subcontractor to LM MS2 for past Transmitter and MFCS modification developments and are the design agent for the MFCS MK 99.  Under separate contracts, Raytheon IDS is developing Radar transmitter group and MFCS upgrades for Aegis AMOD Upgrade and BMD 4.0.1, all of which will be part of the DDG 113 - 115 AWS configuration.  As such, Raytheon IDS understands the system functionality and requirements in order to produce these systems to satisfy AWS requirements. 
In considering the schedule requirements for deliveries, it is critical to note that the complete AWS must begin testing at least nine (9) months in advance of the ship's Required Delivery Date (RDD). In order to deliver a fully functionally tested AWS by the RDDs for each of these ships, the Navy must award this procurement on a sole-source basis.  If the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar transmitter group or MFCS MK 99 contracts were to be awarded to another company for any of the three ships, the schedule to develop Level III Technical Data Packages, conduct the competition, perform production qualification, and integrate and test the complete AWS would cause the delivery to miss the respective RDD by a significant amount of time.  
For the reasons stated above, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), NAVSEA intends to award a contract for the production, integration, testing and engineering support services for the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar Transmitter Group and MK99 Missile Fire Control System (MFCS) for DDG 113-115 to Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) in Tewksbury, MA. Parties interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Raytheon directly. See Note 22.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) will utilize other than full and open competition to award a contract for production, integration, testing and engineering support services for the MK 7 Aegis Weapon System (AWS) for DDG 113-115 to Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems & Sensors (LM MS2) in Moorestown, NJ. The Government anticipates procuring DDG 113-related long lead material and other non-recurring engineering (NRE) efforts in FY09. Options for DDG 113 equipment procurement in FY10 and DDG 114-115 equipment procurements in FY11 will be executed as separately priced options.
LM MS2 will be responsible for production and fabrication of the AWS AN/SPY-1D(V) arrays (4 per shipset), including an integrated Multi-Mission Signal Processor (MMSP), Aegis AMOD Upgrade equipment (AAU), and Combat System Support Equipment (CSSE) for DDG 113-115.  In addition, LM MS2 will be responsible for the production of an MMSP to be installed at the Surface Combat System Center (SCSC), Wallops Island, VA to support combat system certification and life cycle support.  LM MS2 will also be responsible for integration of the AWS elements delivered under separate contracts (e.g., Missile Fire Control System MK99, AN/SPY-1D(V) radar transmitter group, computers and displays) and system level testing at the Production Test Center (PTC) in Moorestown, NJ. LM MS2 will be responsible for providing technical and engineering services at the PTC during integration and test, and at shipyards during construction or as a result of sea trials and other relevant special studies. If all options are exercised, the maximum quantities procured for three complete AWS shipsets and SCSC will include twelve AN/SPY-1D(V) arrays, four MMSPs, three AAU sets and three CSSE sets. 
LM MS2 is the only existing source with the in-depth technical expertise, knowledge, resources and infrastructure required to produce, integrate, and test the MK 7 AWS without adverse impact to scheduled AWS deliveries in support of the USN shipbuilding and ship deployment requirements.  LM MS2 possesses unique experience in AWS design, development, production, assembly, and testing, and currently provides the necessary services to deliver fully functionally tested AWS ship sets to the fleet.  LM MS2 also provides installation material, ancillary equipment, provisioning items, technical data, and provisioning technical data.  As such, it understands the system functionality and requirements in order to produce systems that satisfy the AWS requirements and is compatible with existing components and infrastructure of the ACS. All previous AWS production contracts for this equipment have been awarded to Lockheed Martin MS2 (or its antecedents) since the authorization of the first Aegis Cruiser. Furthermore, LM MS2 has developed an extensive infrastructure (e.g., production facilities, qualified supplier base, special test equipment, data networks, system test environments, producibility engineering workstations) at its Moorestown, NJ facility to support AWS production.  
In considering the schedule requirements for deliveries, it is critical to note that the complete AWS must begin testing at least nine (9) months in advance of the ship's Required Delivery Date (RDD). In order to deliver a fully functionally tested AWS by the RDDs for each of these ships, the Navy must award this procurement on a sole-source basis.  If any element of this procurement were to be awarded to another company for any of the three ships, the schedule to develop Level III Technical Data Packages, conduct the competition, perform production qualification, and integrate and test the complete AWS would cause the delivery to miss the respective RDD by a significant amount of time.  Similarly, the award of an MMSP production contract to meet the SCSC requirements to another company would significantly delay combat system certification. 
For the reasons stated above, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), NAVSEA intends to award a contract for the production, integration, testing and engineering support services for production, integration and test of the MK 7 Aegis Weapon System (AWS) for DDG 113-115 and an MMSP at SCSC, Wallops Island, VA to Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems & Sensors (LM MS2) in Moorestown, NJ. Parties interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact LM MS2 directly. See Note 22.

Quotes received prior to the award datewill be considered by the Government.A determination by the Government not tocompete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solelywithin the discretion of the government. Information received will normally beconsidered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct acompetitive procurement. The design of this part is unstable. Engineering,manufacturing, or performance characteristics indicate that the required designobjectives have not been achieved. Major changes are contemplated because thepart has a low process yield or has demonstrated marginal performance duringtests or service use. These changes will render the present part obsolete andunusable in its present configuration. Limited acquisition from the presentsource is anticipated pending configuration changes.

Only the source(s) previouslyapproved by the government for this item have been solicited. The time requiredfor approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayedpending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you mustsubmit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the"https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx" Naval Inventory Control Point PhiladelphiaSource Approval Information Brochure. This brochure identifies technical datarequired to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of thesame or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your requestfor source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with youroffer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for sourceapproval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the SourceApproval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by theSource Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under thissolicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submittedhereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude theability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, awardof the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>NSN 7R-2915-015353778-AT, REF NR 817300-33, QTY 14 EA, DELIVERY FOBORIGIN. This part requires engineering source approval by the design controlactivity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique designcapability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualifiedsource(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). Theapproved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technicaldata that are not economically available to the Government, and the data orknowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternatesource must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualificationprocedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity havingjurisdiction over the part in the intended application. Hamilton Sundstrand(cage 73030) is the only approved source of repair. The subject item requiresGovernment source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flightcritical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate tosupport acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previouslyapproved by the government for this item have been solicited. The time requiredfor approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayedpending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you mustsubmit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the"https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx" Naval Inventory Control Point PhiladelphiaSource Approval Information Brochure. This brochure identifies technical datarequired to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of thesame or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your requestfor source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with youroffer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for sourceapproval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the SourceApproval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by theSource Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under thissolicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submittedhereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude theability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, awardof the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

POSITION DESCRIPTION:  SENIOR COMMODITY AND LOGISTICS SPECIALIST, 	USAID/ETHIOPIA

A.  BACKGROUND

USAID/Ethiopias Health, AIDS, Population and Nutrition (HAPN) Team implements programs in health, with HIV/AIDS constituting the largest portion of the health program, at over $200 million for FY 2008.  The health portfolio covers child survival (immunization, Integrated Management of Childhood illnesses, nutrition), reproductive health (family planning, safe motherhood), and infectious diseases (tuberculosis, malaria). HIV/AIDS activities are implemented through the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which includes programs in primary prevention of HIV, Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT), Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC), palliative care, antiretroviral Treatment (ART), HIV/AIDS counseling and testing (HCT), and other care and support programs.  USAIDs malaria activities are implemented with funding from the Presidents Malaria Initiative (PMI) in the areas of Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs), Intermittent Presumptive Treatment (IPT) and case management using artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT).

Along with the GFATM, PEPFAR/Ethiopia is by far the largest donor for HIV/AIDS programs in the country, and around 60% of the total PEPFAR budget is managed by USAID.  Supply chain activities managed by USAID include the single largest agreement in the PEPFAR portfolio.   USAIDs health program in Ethiopia is also substantial, with the Agency again well placed as one of the largest donors.  The largest proportion of USAID/Ethiopia health sector funding, over $120 million in fiscal year 2008, is provided through PEPFAR. This multi-agency program is implemented under the leadership of the U.S. Ambassador to Ethiopia, and is guided by a national Executive Committee.  The USG PEPFAR team maintains close links to Ethiopias national AIDS coordination structures within the MOH, in particular the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Office (HAPCO) and the Programming and Planning Department (PPD), as well as other key line Ministries including the Ministries of Education; Youth and Sports; and Women and Social Affairs.

Though Ethiopia has enjoyed many successes related to HIV/AIDS, there remain many challenges to addressing this disease threat, as well as in improving the health of Ethiopians.  National HIV prevalence in Ethiopia is estimated at 2.1%, with prevalence of 7.7% in urban areas, and 0.9% in rural areas.  With 85% of the population in rural areas, about half the countrys estimated one million HIV positive individuals are dispersed in a vast area twice the size of Texas or France, with poor infrastructure and communications.

It is within this context that the MOH has launched an energetic and highly ambitious plan to reach the goal of universal access to primary health care services, including HIV/AIDS, by 2010.  The initiative involves a five fold increase in the number of health centers, from around 650 currently to a target of 3,200.  The universal access HIV targets are utilized for national planning purposes, but large funding gaps to cover commodities needed to reach these targets, as well as other critical inputs such as human resources for health, exist.

The MOH has developed well-designed, and in some cases costed, five-year master plans for Pharmaceutical Logistics, Laboratory and Health Management Information Systems (HMIS).  USAID strongly supports all of these critical components for systems strengthening.

The countrys central medical stores, PFSA, previously a parastatal, has recently been brought fully back into the public sector, with the mission of fully supplying MOH sites with all needed commodities.  The national reference laboratory, EHNRI, works with quantification of laboratory reagent needs, including rapid test kits (RTKs), lab reagents and supplies, with support from the Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative (CHAI), and from PEPFAR through SCMS. Other important donor partners in supply chain management are UNICEF, which procures HIV commodities for the MOH, particularly with GFATM monies, while also providing TA for the PLMP, and the World Bank, through the health sector development program, Protecting Basic Services.  USAID collaborates closely with all these partners.

BASIC FUNCTION

USAID/Ethiopia requires the services of a Senior Commodity and Logistics Specialist to provide technical, management, and coordination services in all areas of HIV/AIDS commodity procurement and supply chain management in support of USAID/Ethiopias HIV/AIDS program. The Specialist will also liaise and work closely with USAID/Ethiopias broader health program in the area of supply chain management, promoting synergies between the programs.  The activities will include providing technical input and oversight of implementing partners efforts in forecasting and quantification of national and Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) HIV/AIDS commodity needs, as well as direct procurement, warehousing, distribution, information management, monitoring and reporting. The Specialist will guide implementing partners efforts supporting capacity building in these areas, with special focus on supporting implementation of Ethiopias national Pharmaceutical Logistics Master Plan (PLMP).  The Specialist will be a member of a multi-disciplinary, HIV/AIDS team implementing U.S. Government (USG) programs under the Investing in People program area.  The Specialist will be responsible for providing guidance to the USAID team, as well as implementing partners and other stakeholders, in making strategic technical and programmatic decisions regarding supply chain management and related areas.  The Specialist will also be responsible for ensuring that procurement and supply chain monitoring and evaluation systems meet USAID and PEPFAR management and reporting requirements, that activities are well coordinated with all partners to meet Ethiopias commodity and supply chain needs, and that reinforcing Ethiopias sustainable capacity in these functions is aggressively pursued.  

The Senior Commodity and Logistics Specialist will be required to represent USAID/Ethiopia and its technical assistance program with the Government of Ethiopia (GOE), international organizations and other stakeholders in the area of HIV/AIDS supply chain management.   Since supply chain management strengthening efforts in Ethiopia are largely cross-cutting, many capacity building efforts promoted by the Specialist will indirectly support other health programs including tuberculosis (TB), malaria, reproductive health, child survival, etc.  S/he will work closely with PEPFAR/Ethiopia and USAID/Ethiopia supply chain implementing partners (and other USAID and USG partners as appropriate), providing technical assistance and other support to ensure the uninterrupted supply of essential HIV/AIDS commodities.  Facilitating and overseeing the efforts of USAID/Ethiopia implementing partners, s/he will work with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and other stakeholders to improve the functions of forecasting, procurement planning and inventory control, financing, distribution and customer service in relation to HIV/AIDS commodities.  The Specialist will also assist the MOH and other stakeholders in advocating for improved supply chain management, including additional human and material resources (e.g. through support in developing supply chain-related portions of funding proposals).  The Specialist will be USAID/Ethiopias representative on PEPFAR, MOH and donor technical working groups and other centralized working groups relevant to health sector supply chain logistics.

The Senior Commodity and Logistics Specialist will be responsible for the planning, implementation, management, monitoring, results reporting, advocacy and performance improvement of USAIDs HIV/AIDS commodity procurement and logistics activities, as well as coordinating these activities as needed with other USG agencies implementing health and HIV/AIDS programs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p><br /><strong>PURPOSE</strong><br />The purpose of this initial notice is to formally announce the General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Design and Construction Division (9PC) requirement for a highly qualified General Contractor (GC) to provide construction services to construct a Pedestrian Bridge and a new five (5) level Employee Parking structure in support of the San Ysidro Land Port of Entry (LPOE) Expansion and Reconfiguration Project in San Ysidro, California.

<p><strong>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</strong><br />The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Design and Construction Division (9PC) has a requirement to procure services from a highly qualified General Contractor (GC) to provide construction services to construct a Pedestrian Bridge and a new five (5) level Employee Parking structure in support of the San Ysidro Land Port of Entry (LPOE) Expansion and Reconfiguration Project in San Ysidro, California.<br />The Port currently has an existing pedestrian bridge which is used jointly by both the public and the Port staff.  The bridge's current design combined with heightened security concerns have led to the determination that it no longer operates efficiently and will need to be demolished.  It will be replaced by the new Pedestrian Bridge located north of the existing, aligning East to West over the Interstate 5 freeway.  The new Pedestrian Bridge itself will consist of four specific structures that will help accommodate pedestrian movement throughout the port.  These structures are defined for this project as follows: the East-West Pedestrian Structure, the North-South Pedestrian Structure, the West Pedestrian Approach Ramp Structure and the East Pedestrian Ramp Structure.</p>
<p>The new five (5) level employee parking structure will be located to the west of the Interstate 5 freeway and consist of one parking level at grade and four above.  There will also be a supporting speed ramp and vertical pedestrian circulation.</p>
<p><strong>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</strong><br />The project design and construction documents will be complete on Wednesday July 1, 2009 at which time they will be made available.  In an effort to accelerate document dissemination, GSA would like to begin the process of identifying interested GC's.  Therefore those who are interested in receiving the documents for this project must complete the Document Security Notice (DSN) attached to this notice.  Once completed, the DSN should be emailed to the Contract Specialist, Chris Lee at christopher.lee@gsa.gov.

<DESC>Statement of Work
The Structural Engineering firm shall provide structural engineering design and services for the evaluations of the design documents of the SPEAR 3 seismic retrofit, Building 140 and the exterior portion of the Booster Ring including but not limited to the calculations and drawings. The seismic retrofit designs of Building 140, Booster Ring, and SPEAR 3 were based on Uniform Building Code 1997 (UBC 1997) in conjunction with SLAC Seismic Specifications. The purpose of this work is to perform a comparison analysis of the designs to determine whether the designs will comply with the seismic design requirements of California Building Code 2007 (CBC 2007). Provide a complete redesign of the retrofit as necessary.
3.0 Scope of Work
The structural design shall be performed by a registered California structural engineer with experience and familiarity with the concrete shielding design. A meaningful comparison needs to carry out a typical previous design not only to evaluate the overall seismic forces but also the requirements of connection details to delineate the differences of the two codes.

The proposed purchase order is needed to support the increased work load at SOC. It is critical that SOC continues to use B&K systems to maintain compatibility and consistency in measurements and calibration standards with the existing systems. If another source is utilized for purchasing these sound monitoring, calibration, and generating systems, the schedule and technical impacts to the research efforts would likely significantly delay the development of field and clinical therapies to protect against and reverse hearing loss in the warfighter.

The solicitation will now be 100% Hub-Zone Set-Aside competitive acquisition for Hub-Zone qualified businesses.  The solicitation number will still be (W911QY-09-R-0024).    The U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division has a requirement for the production of the Army Combat Shirt (ACS).

1 Chelsea Street
New London, CT 06320-5506

2.  Research Opportunity Title
 
Recovery of Heavy Oil on the Sea Floor 

3.  Program Name

Recovery of Heavy Oil

4.  Research Opportunity Number

BAA Number HSCG32-09-R-R00024

5.  Response Date

Proposals due July 31, 2009


6.  Research Opportunity Description

6.1 Background
Coast Guard regulations found in Title 33, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 154 and 155, require that certain vessels and facilities that transfer oil or hazardous materials have response plans that include methods for the detection and recovery of Group V heavy (submerged) oils.  However, the Coast Guard and industry do not have a consistent and reliable method to detect and recover submerged oil.  Once spilled, heavy oils can penetrate water intakes at power plants and other facilities, at times requiring these facilities to shut down.  Heavy oils can also harm wetlands, beaches, shellfish and other marine life, as well as property such as boats and docks

This is the second step in the process of developing an entire recovery system to find and recover oil on the sea floor in a variety of conditions.  Previous work has been done in almost all of the components and many references are listed below. Included are some of the latest efforts during the most recent spills and research being performed including the final report for the first step of the evaluation of detection techniques by RDC.  But because this type of spill occurs infrequently, limited documentation is available to determine how successful the recovery was, how well the configuration worked and recommendations to make the system better.  This type of information is needed for planners and responders, especially those responsible for Group V oils.  

6.2 Scope

The scope of this BAA includes Phase I (Design Concepts) and Phase II (Prototype Development).  Phase I will be fully funded and Phase II will be an option that may or may not be exercised by the Government.

6.3 Phase I (Design Concepts)
	The contractor shall develop a proof of concept solution and a final design for a complete system.  This system will include everything needed from the recovery on the bottom to the separation of any water and/or silt or sand that may also be collected.  The contractor shall identify whether the design is for a vessel or designed to be deployed stationary in a current flow (i.e. used to corral oil that is moving along the bottom towards a sensitive location).

The design concept shall demonstrate as many of the following capabilities as possible:
1)	Presence of heavy oil on the sea floor identified with 80% certainty 
2)	Oil location geo-referenced to within 5 meters in accuracy
3)	Minimal dispersion of oil or bottom material into the water column
4)	Provides real time data/feedback 
5)	Provides recovery for all sea floor conditions (silty, rocky, and gravel bottom types; vegetation and shellfish-covered bottoms; and over flat and sloped areas and areas with rapid substrate changes) 
6)	Operates in fresh and sea water conditions equally well
7)	Operates in water depths of up to 200 feet
8)	Minimal maintenance requirements (easy to maintain and calibrate)
9)	Easy to operate and requires minimal training 
10)	Easily de-contaminated and durable
11)	Equipment operation not adversely affected by exposure to oil
12)	Operates in water currents at the surface of up to 1.5 knots
13)	Deploys and operates in up to 5 foot seas
14)	Operable during the day and night
15)	Sets up within 12 hours of arriving on site -- Special requirements shall be identified
16)	Viscosity  Operates in the range of 2000-100,000 cSt
17)	Includes a decanting system that can handle the heavy oil and any oil that refloats in the recovery process
18)	Process to complete polishing the resultant water for disposal
19)	Minimal impacts to benthic resources that may be disturbed

Design packages shall include:
1) A description of each of the components
2) The background and level of development of each (e.g., new, adapted from other application, used on spills before, used in test before, etc.) 
3) The operation of the system (how the components work together) and any limitations (e.g. visibility, limits of viscosity, temperature).  The design package shall identify the recovery capability amount of oil in barrels per day (24 hour) and the viscosity range used for this calculation
4) Specific developmental activities that are needed to complete final design
5) Specific tests or limitations on equipment (e.g. special power requirements, minimum depth of water, space needed, etc.)
6) Proposed schedule and costs for Prototype Development

6.4 Phase II (Prototype Development)
Testing will be conducted by an independent test facility selected by RDC and will be supervised by Coast Guard personnel.  The Oil and Hazardous Material Simulated Test Tank (OHMSETT) in Leonardo, NJ, is the anticipated initial test facility; see information at www.ohmsett.com).  Testing will occur in the large tow tank or equivalent.

Offerors have the opportunity to be creative in their selection of technical approach.  A combination of technologies that meet the requirements may also be proposed.  This system may be designed to perform in a stationary mode (i.e. currents move the oil to the collection site) or a mobile mode (system moves to recover).

or (860) 271-2886.  Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

8.  Additional Information

This announcement is restricted to designing a concept (Phase I), followed by development of a prototype system and that portion of advanced technology development related to a specific system or hardware procurement (Phase II).  Awards made under this BAA are for scientific study and experimentation directed towards developing a system to detect/recovery heavy oils on the sea floor.  The technological concepts proposed under Phase I shall not change under Phase II.  Phase II is for development and deployment of Phase I technologies.

Any hardware or software developed under a contract resulting from this BAA will be retained by the Offeror.  The Coast Guard does not expect to own the detection/recovery capability (i.e., proofs of concept or prototypes).  

II. AWARD INFORMATION 

Award of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts.  Award(s) will be made to the Offeror(s) whose proposals are considered to be of the highest technical importance to the Government in accordance with the evaluation criteria, taking into consideration the available funding.  It is anticipated that cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) completion form contracts will be awarded.  

The period of performance of the awards will typically be:

Base award (10 months)  Phase I
Option 1 (one year)  Phase II 

RDC anticipates a budget of $1,000,000 for the total program (Phases I and II).  RDC plans to fully fund up to $500,000 for approximately three to five Phase I contracts that will most likely range from $50,000 to $150,000 per award.  The anticipated date of award is approximately October 1, 2009, subject to the availability of funds. It is anticipated that 2-3 of the original vendors from Phase I will be awarded the option contract (Phase 2) to build a prototype system.  The awards will most likely range from $150-200K. The anticipated date of award is approximately October 1, 2010.

III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION

All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Government.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of technology of this proposal for exclusive competition among those entities.

Volume II: Cost Proposal
 
The Cost Proposal shall consist of a cover page and two parts, Part 1 and Part 2.  Part 1 shall provide a detailed cost/fee breakdown of all costs by cost category by Offerors fiscal year and Part 2 shall provide a cost/fee breakdown by task/subtask using the same task numbers as in the Statement of Work.  Clear and separate costs shall be provided for Phase I and Phase II.  For proposal pricing purposes, Offerors should assume a contract start date of on or about October 1, 2009.  The cost proposal should be limited to the minimum number of pages necessary to satisfy the specific requirements set forth below.  Submission of computer-generated data is not desired but if it is essential to support the cost proposal, it may be submitted as an addendum and must be clearly cross-referenced to the material it supports in the cost proposal.

Cost proposals should represent the Offerors best response to the solicitation.  Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between promised performance and cost or pricing data must be fully explained in the proposal.  Failure to explain any significant inconsistencies may demonstrate the Offerors lack of understanding of the nature and scope of the work required.  Accordingly, the cost proposal must be sufficient to establish the reasonableness, realism and completeness of the proposed cost/price.  Further, any modifications made to the initial proposal must likewise be thoroughly supported in writing regardless of whether such changes are made during negotiations or at the time of a proposal revision.

The Government contemplates the award of cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) completion form contracts resulting from this BAA.  The Government does not anticipate that the condition for adequate price competition in FAR 15.403-1(c)(1) will exist.  Submission of cost or pricing data in accordance with FAR 15.408, Table 15-2 is, therefore, required as part of the cost proposal if the cost proposal value is $550,000 or greater.  If the proposed cost is less than $550,000, then information other than cost or pricing data may be requested as described in FAR 15.403-3.

The learning experiences must be interactive and learner centered where cadets take an active role in the learning "phases". The learning phases will reveal students' existing knowledge and misconceptions of key concepts; explore, experiment, process, reflect, and apply knowledge; and model or perform the desired behavior based on clear conditions and standards. The course must contain multiple assessments methods to capture cadet progress and learning outcomes (e.g. traditional and performance-based systems). The assessment tasks must serve as tools for verifying and documenting that cadets have mastered the intended learning objectives and outcomes. Assessment tasks will provide feedback to cadets and instructors that guide classroom instruction and improve cadet performance. Questioning strategies (such as reflection) to maximize learning, engagement, and critical thinking must be included. The course must also contain higher level thinking skills and activities designed to engage and broaden the student's minds and tap into their natural curiosity about space enabling them to sharpen their thinking skills. The material shall consist of digital and hard copies of 1) a Student Textbook with electronic version of the textbook (in PDF and MS Office 2003 or later format) bound to the inside back cover of the hard copy textbook, 2) an Instructor Guide (IG) (containing Lesson Plans for all lessons included in the Student Textbook, with accompanying PowerPoint slides embedded into the lesson plans adjacent to suggested script for instructor use and an answer key for the end-of-chapter "Checkpoint" questions found in the text), plus corresponding DVD/CD bound inside the back cover of the hard copy IG containing all IG material cited herein to be included in the IG plus the PowerPoint slide files for each lesson, an Instructor's Test Bank, an answer key file providing answers to the test bank items/questions found on the DVD/CD, instructions and handouts/resource information/presentation slides/etc. for teachers needed to support any interactive in-class or student-centered learning activities called for by the lessons, plus any video files needed for each lesson (files on the DVD/CD will be in Word and PDF formats for the text files, PowerPoint format for the slides [using Microsoft Office Suite programs (MS Office 2003 or later) for all text and PowerPoint files], and any appropriate video file formats). Video files to be used in conjunction with other materials for teaching lessons may be included in a CD/DVD organized such that teachers can easily locate each video file intended for use for a particular lesson or such videos may be embedded into the electronic lesson plan files on the DVD/CD.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Government is requesting that interested concerns furnish the following information:</p>
<p>(1) Company name, address, point of contact, voice and fax telephone numbers and e-mail address.</p>

PLEASE DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF A SOLICITATION, AS ONE DOES NOT EXIST.
<p>The purpose of this market research (Source Sought Synopsis) is to determine if there are sources that can supply an existing requirement. The Government is seeking, qualified, experienced sources, with information to provide two (2) 3-D interactive computer models, one simulating on-base conditions and one illustrating off-base conditions. In order to maximize teaching effectiveness, Incident Management Course instructors require the development of three-dimensional (3-D) interactive teaching aids to be used in conjunction with script-driven, contractor-created realistic scenarios. To have the intricate descriptive aspects related to the aforementioned &lsquo;conditions' supplied by the government. Develop a multi-scene on-base accident/incident scenario along with one for off-base incorporating motion and video in both. 3-D model dimensions should be scaled to the existing map in accordance with instructors' direction using photogrammetric, traditional measurements and CAD file drawings. Finished scenarios will simulate actual accidents/incidents to the highest degree possible so that students' experiences and responses are genuine. In order to enhance realism, scenarios are to integrate authentic touches such as fog, fire, smoke, recognizable characters, composited images, video, voice-overs, music, sound effects and the like according to government-provided scripts and/or story boards. Commercial-grade off-the-shelf software will be used to provide solid modeling and animation technology that simulates generic on-base and off-base terrain in three dimensions. In addition, the contractor is to work with IMC instructors to develop interactive, script-driven exercise scenarios for use in teaching best practices to accident/incident responders. Some examples of possible scenarios follow:<br />a.) A Chinook (helicopter) crash on an highway close to a military installation. b.) An F-15 (fighter aircraft) crash in an off-base reservoir. c.) A report of animal rights activists on the base runway. d.) A major fire on an AF base. The anticipated period of performance is 1 September 2009 - 31 August 2010 with four (4) option years. A site visit is tentatively scheduled in June 2009.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Government is requesting that interested concerns with background in accident reconstruction and training aid development furnish the following information:</p>
<p>(1) Company name, address, point of contact, voice and fax telephone numbers and e-mail address(s).</p>
<p>(2) Type of business, i.e., small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned, HubZone, serviced-disabled veteran-owned small business, large business, etc.</p>
<p>(3) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code</p>

The NAICS Code is 541512.  The small business size standard is 25M. The U.S Food and Drug Administration has a need to establish a modern, state-of-the-art, fully-electronic system that creates, coordinated, integrated, streamlined, consistent, reliable, and accurate operations for the management FDA Advisory Committee processes. This requirement is to design, develop, and implement a FDA Advisory Committee Tracking and Reporting System (FACTRS).  The system will accommodate all FDA Advisory Committee business processes.  This includes functionality that incorporates electronic records management, workflow, and process automation. Records management consists of document creation, check-in, routing, review, signoff, storage, and retrieval.  Document review shall include options to edit, version, and return submitted review documents and options to communicate within the system to the reviewer any specific comments on deficiencies in submissions.  Automation shall include the generation of reports, and the auto-population of forms and template documents. The system shall provide electronic notifications to staff of necessary review actions and deadlines, and shall allow for electronic signature. FACTRS shall serve as a data driven system which reduce data and business process redundancies and allow for both complex ad hoc and standard data quarries. FACTRS must integrate with other FDA legacy and enterprise solutions to obtain necessary information to manage the program, such as personnel information on Advisory Committee members or internet access for public submissions of nominations to the Agency. The system shall offer access to information for all operational units involved in Advisory Committee management which is currently unavailable. It shall allow the Agency to respond to inquiries, required reporting, and unanticipated requests for data in a timelier manner and with the reduced risk of inconsistent and inaccurate data reporting. FACTRS shall provide a structured, electronic system with access to data that would support the research of current business processes and drive ongoing advancements in the management of the FDA Advisory Committee program at all levels of the organization.  The work shall be built on appropriate existing legacy or enterprise systems components that provide the functionalities described above to meet the business needs of FDAs Advisory Committee program. System Design and Development support is required to produce systems and business application software that integrate hardware, software, data, network and other technologies consistent with FDA IT Standards.  Review and analyze the requirements, gathered to date and update to be accurate and comprehensive and provide analysis for stage gate review. FDA is seeking senior and mid level analyst, developer and documentation specialist expertise to perform the FACTRS application design, development, and system unit testing in accordance to FDA IT Standards with the Appian Business Process Management System (BPMS) the primary development tool. It is required to follow the HHS Enterprise Performance Life Cycle (EPLC) framework which consists of ten life cycle phases.  The EPLC is a mechanism that assures that systems under development meet the established requirements and support the FDA mission functions.  It provides a structured approach to managing information systems projects, beginning with the planning processes and ending with the implementation. It is required to review the Systems Requirements Specification (SRS), update as appropriate, and conduct a successful requirements analysis stage gate before proceeding to the design phase. Within each phase, activities, responsibilities, reviews, and deliverables are defined.  Exit criteria are established for each phase and stage gate reviews are conducted through the IT governance process to ensure that the projects management quality, soundness, and technical feasibility remain acceptable and the project is ready and approved to move forward to the next phase.  The scope primarily involves the design and development phases, but limited work in other phases will be performed. This will be a web-based environment primarily based on, but not limited to: Appian BPMS software, Java and JavaScript code, Oracle 10g database server, Microsoft Exchange mail server, Adobe PDF fillable forms. System and Data Integration  Application shall be integrated with other ongoing projects in the Agency, sharing data and/or code between projects such as, but not limited to: Common Electronic Document Room (cEDR), Automated Employee Process System (AEP), Commissioner  Fellowship, Advanced Submission Tracking and Retrieval (FASTAR), AIMS, and CASPER. The work shall adhere to FDAs Enterprise Architecture (EA) and Architecture Review Team (ARM) standards, and incorporate them to meet future requirements resulting from government initiatives, migration to new data standards and changes to internal OIT requirements. Provide all resources to accomplish knowledge transfer for thorough understanding of all FACTRS system components with the intention that those mentored can support the FACTRS system independent of the design/development contractor. Perform maintenance and technical support related to testing, problem determination, remedy, and configuration management. It is required to have key personnel that have Appian development experience and able to provide Appian development expertise.  It is anticipated that travel may be required to attend conferences and symposiums to provide interface and attain knowledge necessary for the performance of the requirements.

A copy of the standard is available from Global Engineering Documents (1-800-854-7179). Stage Gate Reviews are required at the end of each phase to provide for independent review and approval of key elements of the IT projects development or operation.  Stage Gate Reviews consist of an independent confirmation by IT governance organization that all documents and contract deliverables are satisfactorily produced and adequately met all exit criteria for the phase to permit advancement to the next phase. It is required to produce all required documentation and perform all activities necessary to complete the phase as identified in the Enterprise Performance Life Cycle Framework (EPLC).  In addition, be responsible for providing documentation of known issues and plans to mitigate the risks, if any, and facilitate the preparation and execution of the stage gate.

<DESC>This notice is issued by NASA/JSC to post a sources sought synopsis via theinternet and solicit responses from qualified interested parties.  This effort is a follow-on contract.  The current contract was a sole source procurementawarded to the Charles Stark Draper Laboratories, Inc.	At the time of the procurement,Draper was the only company to have provided this capability to JSC.   This sources sought notice is for market research purposes only and to also allowIndustry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, aswell as promote competition. Summary:NASA/JSC is seeking Potential Offerors/Contractors to support the Aeroscience and FlightMechanics Division (AFMD) in the development, maintenance, and application of Guidance,Navigation, and Control (GN&C) simulation and analysis tools to support the operation andsustaining engineering of the International Space Station (ISS), including VisitingVehicle (VV) proximity operations, docking, and mated configurations. The PotentialOfferors/Contractors shall also support AFMD in the development, maintenance, andapplication of GN&C simulation and analysis tools to support space flight and technologydevelopment programs including the Orion Project, the Autonomous Landing and HazardAvoidance Technology (ALHAT) Project, and future exploration and science programs.NASA/JSC is seeking companies with demonstrated experience in the design and operation ofhuman spacecraft, and designing and developing innovative and practical solutions tocomplex GN&C problems.	One recent example of an innovative solution is the ISS ZeroPropellant Maneuver (ZPM), a creative implementation of optimal trajectory designrequiring expert knowledge of the ISS momentum manager controller, ISS gravity gradienteffects, and on-orbit aerodynamic forces. In order to be implemented on the ISS, the ZPMhad to work within the constraints of existing ISS avionics and software (e.g.,Timeliner), and be fully compliant with ISS flight rules and operational timeconstraints.For the ISS Program, the Potential Offerors/Contractors shall analyze ISS assembly andstage operations to determine control system stability and performance against programrequirements and objectives. Design or feasibility analysis shall be performed to assessdesign and mission changes. Verification analysis shall be performed to verify/certifycontrollability, estimate fuel and momentum usage, determine attitude time histories forplanned operations, and support flight or operational readiness statements. The potentialfor Controller/Controller and Controller/Structure dynamic interactions shall be assessedby the Potential Offerors/Contractors using frequency domain linear analysis and timedomain simulation. This planned effort, shall support investigations of on-orbitanomalies and ISS system failures impacting ISS GN&C system performance or operations.The Potential Offerors/Contractors shall develop or modify simulation and analysis toolsand/or system models, as necessary, to reconstruct flight anomalies or failures todetermine root cause. The Potential Offerors/Contractors shall develop new ControlStructure Interaction (CSI) analysis methodology and engineering solutions, toaccommodate ISS changes and new VV operations, or to improve the operational efficiencyof the ISS. In addition, the Potential Offerors/Contractors shall provide softwaresustaining engineering of the User Interface Language, also known as Timeliner,including the software Kernel (core features) and Adapter (ISS adaptation) for the ISSonboard and ground elements. The Potential Offerors/Contractors shall work closely withthe ISS Prime Contractor for flight software in the integration of the updated Timelinersoftware into releases of the command and control software and the payload executiveprocessor.For the Orion Project, the Potential Offerors/Contractors shall provide an independentassessment of the content and quality of the Orion prime contractors GN&C FlightSoftware (FSW) design, development, test and verification activities and deliverables.The Potential Offerors/Contractors shall work closely with the joint NASA/Orion primecontractor Architecture Working Group (AWG) by collaborating in the design, developmentand implementation of the top-level GN&C executive FSW architecture. The PotentialOfferors/Contractors shall also assist in the flight implementation of the FSWarchitecture in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) environment, as well as itsfunctional equivalent in the Matlab/Simulink environment. The execution of this task bythe Potential Offerors/Contractors requires a very high level of technical expertise inthe FSW domain. Potential Offerors/Contractors shall also provide design and analysissupport to the Orion Orbit Mode Team (OMT) in four key areas: (1) Rendezvous, proximityoperations, and docking, (2) Flight control, (3) Navigation, and (4) Guidance andtargeting. All of these applications require an understanding of linear systems theory,celestial mechanics, estimation theory, and the limitations of flight computationalresources. A high level of proficiency with linear covariance analysis and theavailability of contractor-supplied linear covariance tools are essential to thesuccessful execution of major architectural trades for the Orion navigation system. These contractor-supplied linear covariance tools must be made available for use by allparticipants on the joint GN&C Mode Teams, including other contractors. PotentialOfferors/Contractors support for Orion flight control is required to provide expertiseand experience with complex multi-effector, multi-string propulsion system design,development, test and operational expertise.  The development and oversight of Orionflight control algorithms requires in-depth knowledge of individual thruster on-timetechniques in both an analytic and high fidelity six degree of freedom setting. Forwardwork in this area will involve fault detection, isolation, and recovery (FDIR)development of mixed effector string components.  FDIR development shall leveragePotential Offerors/Contractors experience with the operation and maintenance oftime-critical, human-rated spaceflight vehicle control systems, such as the SpaceShuttle.For the ALHAT Project, the Potential Offerors/Contractors shall develop, test, document,deliver, integrate, and maintain autonomous guidance, navigation and control (AGNC)software to support simulation and flight testing of onboard hazard detection andavoidance and precision lunar landing technologies. The Potential Offerors/Contractorsshall develop, document, deliver, integrate, and maintain the Autonomous FlightManagement (AFM) software providing the functions of: (1) Landing Point Designation(LPD), (2) sensor management, (3) operator command and data interfaces, and (4)Multi-State Excursion Assessment (MSEA) for the descent trajectory corridor. ThePotential Offerors/Contractors shall maintain and document a stand-alone AGNC sandboxanalysis tool to support AGNC development, integration and testing, as well as to verifythe functionality of the integrated ALHAT simulation environments. The PotentialOfferors/Contractors shall develop, test, document, deliver, integrate and maintain anALHAT Derived Navigation Filter (ADNF) to support integrated flight tests of the ALHATSystem, or subsets of the ALHAT System, on an aircraft platform. The ADNF will be basedon the navigation filter developed for the ALHAT simulation environments, but adapted toreflect the differences introduced by the environment, test platform, and navigationsensors associated with Earth-based testing. The Potential Offerors/Contractors shallperform linear covariance analyses to determine the sensitivities of trajectory andnavigation dispersions to variations in environments, trajectories, sensors, effectors,and other parameters. The Potential Offerors/Contractors shall support NASA/JSC in thedevelopment and maintenance of systems engineering products for the ALHAT Projectincluding the Project Technical Requirements Specification (PTRS), Operations Concept(OpsCon), Verification and Validation (V&V) Plan, and Reference Architecture Document(RAD).

<DESC>Background:

NHTSA is representing the U.S. Government in negotiating Global Technical Regulations (GTRs) on Passenger Vehicle Brake Systems, Tires, Glazing, Child Restraints, Child Restraint Anchorage Systems, Alternative Fuel Systems, and Electronic Stability Control.  NHTSA has had many final rulings for FMVSS in the past translated, including ESC and Fuel Integrity.  This is an ongoing process in which current and future FMVSS become potential candidates for future Global Technical Regulations (GTRs).  During this process, NHTSA will need to translate several documents including FMVSS, GTRs, and supplementary document related to them, into various languages including but not limited to Arabic, Chinese, French, Spanish, Russian, and Hindi.  They will then be submitted to the United Nations Compendium of Candidate of Global Technical Regulations and will fulfill the U.S.s obligations in developing GTRs.   


Objective:

This purpose of this contract is to translate several Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), Global Technical Regulations (GTRs), and other related documents, into several languages including Arabic, Chinese, French, Spanish, Russian, and Hindi.   These documents are very technical in nature and use a great deal of engineering terminology.   

General Requirements:

The scope of work is to translate several Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), Global Technical Regulations (GTRs), and other related documents, into several languages including Arabic, Chinese, French, Spanish, Russian, and Hindi.  There may also be relevant supplemental documents that would need to be translated, but should be consistent in terms of technical language to the FMVSS and GTRs.  

Specific Requirements: 

It is critical that the translations be accurate and free of any grammatical mistakes; as misuse of words can cause a loss of meaning when translating documents of a technical nature such as the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards into other languages. These documents will be used to create legislation in the various countries; therefore they must be as accurate as possible.  The turn around time would need to be between 1 and 4 weeks.  


Format of Corporate Capabilities Statement:

Any interested organizations should submit the Corporate Capability Statement which demonstrates the firms ability and interest in no more than 10 pages to perform the key requirements described above.  All proprietary information should be marked as such. 

All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of their business organization, e.g., Large business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned-Business, 8(A), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit organization, in their response. Interested offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Notice no later than 15 calendar days from date of posting. E-mail is the preferred method when receiving responses to this Notice.

NICHD anticipates the clinical studies conducted by the Network will focus on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), safety and efficacy of therapeutics (drugs and devices) used in children. Studies performed in the CTN will encompass a large range of conditions that affect children and may include, but not be limited to, studies of drugs and devices used in the following therapeutic areas: gastrointestinal diseases, including gastroesophageal reflux disease; cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension and hypotension; infectious diseases, including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection; respiratory diseases, including asthma; metabolic disorders, such diabetes and obesity; oncology; neonatal research; rare diseases; and drugs or devices used in the treatment or prophylaxis of chemical or biological agent exposures. 

These studies will be conducted with pediatric patients, who encompass a large range of severity and age, including: out-patient ambulatory care through intensive care, and pre-term infants through adolescents.  The results of these clinical trials will be used primarily to improve the Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) pediatric labeling of drugs. NICHD hopes to initiate studies in 6-12 therapeutic areas (anticipating 2-4 therapeutic interventions per therapeutic area). NICHD currently has a data coordinating center (DCC) under separate contract that provides data-management, data monitoring, auditing, electronic data submission to FDA and regulatory document support to/for ongoing and proposed clinical trials, and therefore will not be a requirement of this contract.

Potential sources must demonstrate and document the following in their capability statements: 1) ability to manage a clinical Network that will be complex and capable of performing multiple pediatric trials; 2) past experience in formulations development 3) researchers with experience in pediatric drug development; 4) ability to coordinate diverse clinical trial activities with other contractors, including the DCC and the NICHD repository;  5) ability to design, perform and analyze results of pre-clinical studies and pediatric clinical trials(both domestically and internationally); and 6) ability to identify and subcontract with investigators/clinical sites who will  recruit neonates, infants, children, and adolescents in the various pediatric therapeutic areas described above.

SOLICITATION NUMBER: 	263-09-500
ISSUANCE DATE:	June 16, 2009
CLOSING DATE/TIME:	July 19, 2009
POSITION TITLE:	Regional Development Outreach & Communications Specialist
MARKET VALUE:	GS-14 
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	2 years with possibility of extension. 
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/Cairo, Egypt
SECURITY ACCESS: 	Secret
AREA OF CONSIDERATION:	U.S. Citizens or U.S. resident aliens who are able to obtain the 
		required security clearance.

Note: A candidate who is otherwise qualified, but does not meet full requirements of the position, may be appointed as a trainee and be required to serve at a lower grade level for the period of one year.

A. 	ORGANIZATIONAL LOCATION OF POSITION:
Although the position requires extensive travel to the Middle East, the incumbent residence will be in Cairo, Egypt.  Cairo is the largest city in Africa and the Middle East.  It has a number of urban problems such as severe pollution, and traffic congestion.  However, it is relatively crime-free and offers many cultural and recreational opportunities, including major museums, important historical sites, and most sports.  The Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea are easily reachable and provide opportunities for most water sports, especially snorkeling and scuba diving.


B.	POSITION TITLE OF DIRECT SUPERVISOR:
The Regional Development Outreach and Communications Specialist will be supervised by, and will report to, the Deputy Director of the OMEP office (Office of Middle East Programs) at USAID/Cairo, Egypt.

C.	OVERVIEW:
The Regional Development Outreach and Communications (DOC) Specialist is located in the Office of Middle East Programs (OMEP) at USAID/Cairo.  The DOC Specialist reports to the Deputy Office Director of the OMEP Office, but will have extensive interaction with the various USAID Mission Directors in the Middle East region, stretching from Morocco to Iraq.  S/he maintains regular contact and collaborates with the DOCs in bilateral USAID Missions and with relevant U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Officers (PAO) to ensure that Embassy personnel, including senior staff, are properly apprised of USAID regional public activities and projects.  S/he also serves as principal liaison with USAIDs Bureau for Legislative and Public Affairs (LPA) in Washington (USAID/W).  

USAID manages over $1 billion of the U.S. Government (USG) development program across the Middle East region.  The USAID portfolio includes a broad range of economic growth, democracy, and social sector program activities.  

The Regional DOC Specialist supports USAID in the achievement of its objectives by producing and disseminating public information about regional Middle East activities for transnational and country-specific consumption, in collaboration with USAID bilateral Mission DOCs.  The Regional DOC is responsible for collecting, investigating, managing, and distributing information associated with USAIDs regional Middle East program.  The Regional DOC serves as OMEPs primary point of contact and liaison for public and media information inquiries.  The Regional DOC also serves as the primary contact for USG interagency regional outreach and diplomacy efforts in the Middle East, and as the primary USAID outreach contact for USAID non-presence countries in the region. 

The Regional DOC Specialist is also responsible for designing and managing regional media programs that support USAIDs regional strategic goal of promoting a culture of democracy.  

USAID activities in the Middle East are complex and politically sensitive.  In this capacity, the incumbent is responsible for strategically planning, developing, implementing, and administering the regional DOC program to promote better awareness and understanding of United States foreign assistance to the region, along with related policies and achievements, among key audiences of the host country, in the United States, and throughout other donor countries.

D.	WORK DESCRIPTION:

Duties and Responsibilities of the Position	% OF TIME

a.  Regional Coordination of USAID Mission DOCs in the Middle East 	15%

Responsible for the overall coordination and regional aggregation of outreach and communications efforts in the 7 USAID missions in the Middle East from Morocco to Iraq, and the regional Office of Middle East Programs.  Coordination includes tracking outreach and communications activities in all USAID-assistance in the Middle East, synthesizing like activities into a regional message of USAID assistance to the Middle East, providing surge assistance, as needed, to bilateral USAID missions planning and executing large scale outreach or communications activities, and reporting to Washington (LPA and ANE) on emerging trends and high profile activities.  

b.  USAID Regional DOC Strategy:	20%

The Regional DOC develops, reviews, and implements USAID's Middle East Communications Strategy, in coordination and consultation with the bilateral USAID missions outreach strategies.  The goal is to promote USAIDs new regional Middle East program to external and internal audiences, while also facilitating information access and sharing amongst the bilateral missions and regional program, and strengthening the missions reporting functions.  The Regional DOC also incorporates the USAID role in non-presence countries into the regional communications strategy.

An important aspect of this responsibility is for the Regional DOC to be a counterpart in USG interagency efforts for regional communications and diplomacy in the Middle East.  The Regional DOC will carry out a liaison role, as well as provide USAID input to interagency efforts, and to communicate back to other USAID missions and offices.

The DOC strategy should take into account the cost/benefits of particular inputs to outputs, to optimize communications tools and distribution to the broadest audiences possible.  The incumbent counsels OMEP on the selection, targeting, and placement of potential DOC materials in keeping with USAID's Strategy.

The DOC must also take into account the need to identify and focus on key sectors that have a natural appeal to local interest as well as USG policies; the importance of ensuring that publicity material used will be non-controversial; and that the material is visually appealing, well-defined, and contains a human interest element.  S/he will also be responsible for putting in place policies and procedures for OMEP communications that clarify roles and responsibilities within the USAID and inter-agency community, as well as with implementing partners, including templates for various communications tools, standards for creating and finalizing DOC materials, and guidelines for planning and managing events.

c.   Media Relations:	10%	

1.  The Regional DOC is responsible for all USAID media activities including reporting on the media, preparing summaries of significant articles and broadcasts, and monitoring media trends that affect the USAID regional Middle East program, including trends in USAID non-presence countries.  Maintains close, frequent professional contact with the highest levels of the media to fulfill this requirement as well as coordinates with USAID bilateral missions, various embassy PAOs, and USAID/W LPA. This may include arranging interviews, briefings, working with USAID bilateral mission DOCs regarding tours of USAID projects and escorting journalists; and keeping records of activities.

2.  Keeps abreast of USAID events to ensure that appropriate press coverage is provided.  Advises OMEP staff if press coverage is not recommended for any culturally sensitive event.   

3.  Reviews the daily press to keep abreast of coverage that relates to USAID activities; advises OMEP of the same.

4.  Plans, researches, drafts, and/or edits press releases and fact sheets for USAID/OMEP.

<DESC><p>This publication serves as a notice of intent to negotiate a sole source contract with Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC) to conduct studies to develop bycatch reducing fishing gear.
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC), Fishery Resource Analysis &amp; Monitoring Division (FRAM) has a requirement for a study to develop bycatch reducing fishing gear as follows:</p>
<p>The Fisheries Resource and Monitoring Division is charged with conducting research and scientific analysis on the groundfish fisheries within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) off the coast of Washington, Oregon, and California. The project objective is to expand the conservation engineering side of the NWFSC's Habitat and Conservation Engineering (H&amp;CE) group in order to provide an increase in conservation engineering information available to managers and the fishing industry for developing fishing gears to reduce bycatch in the West Coast groundfish fishery.</p>
<p>The Northwest Fisheries Science Center's Habitat and Conservation Engineering group has provided a foundation for increasing the scientific information and outreach used to inform managers, and developing fishing gears to reduce bycatch in the west coast groundfish fishery.</p>
<p>In addition, the current PSMFC lead on this project has developed important working relationships with various sectors of the commercial fishing industry, agency and academic research collaborators, and Oregon State University Marine Extension, relationships which facilitate the studies of bycatch research. These relationship would be lost if this ongoing work was not continued with PSMFC.</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with the period of performance commencing approximately August 1, 2009 with no option periods. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990 with a corresponding size standard of $6.5M. <br /><br />This notice represents the only official notice of this solicitation. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by the due set forth in this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. It is the Government's belief that only Pacific States Marine Fisheries can provide these services. However, other potential sources with the expertise and required capabilities to provide these services may submit such data which demonstrates the technical requirements stated above in duplicate no later than 10 calendar days from the date of the posting of this announcement. This data must include sufficient information to allow NOAA to evaluate the proposal relative to the technical requirements stated above. Offerors should include a description of significant collaboration and subcontracting that will be required to provide technically acceptable deliverables. No cost or pricing data is required. Responses shall be faxed to Crystina Elkins at (206)526-6036 or provided by e-mail to Crystina.R.Elkins@noaa.gov. THIS NOT A SOLICITATION. A Justification for Other Than Full &amp; Open Competition (JOFOC) is attached.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) at Orlando, FL  has a requirement to provide life cycle training support to the Device 19G4/19G4A software based trainer for the Surface Warfare Officers School (SWOS) located in Newport, RI.  In support of this mission, the Government has contracted to TJ Incorporated of Christmas, FL under contract N61339-05-C-0162 to provide a phased approach to upgrade, modify and refurbish these devices to bring the Device 19G4 and Device 19G4A up to current DDG-51 Class configuration standards.  These modifications require the development of software to compass the full scope of all of the system modifications.  Subject contract has a period of performance scheduled to end 31 January 2010, however has reached its ceiling and cannot be further modified.

It is the Government's intent to issue a sole-source contract to TJ Incorporated to convert the current 19G4A trainer to include touch screen capabilities.  The Government is not in possession of the software currently under development by TJ Incorporated and is therefore unable to provide it to another contractor as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  It is the Governments intention to establish a sole-source vehicle with TJ Incorporated as the 19G4A trainer must be operational no later than 31 January 2010 to prevent training lapses which would result from continuance of a non-operational trainer.  

The applicable authority is FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.  FAR 6.302-1 (b) (2) states services may be deemed to be available only from one responsible source when limited rights in data exists. 

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. No contract or task order will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. All inquiries and concerns must be addressed by email to the Contract Specialist, Andrea Gordon-Eubanks at andrea.gordon@navy.mil.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.  Responses to this notice must be submitted by 30 June 2009.  A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in a future procurement.

<DESC>This is a request for market research only.  The government does not intend to award a contract as a result of this announcement.  

The U.S. Department of State (DoS) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) has as one of its responsibilities the provision of a wide array of support to criminal justice sector development programs worldwide.  Program countries/areas include Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, Liberia, Lebanon, Haiti, the West Bank, and Kosovo.  INL currently has three indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) CIVPOL contracts under which task orders are competed for individual programs as requirements are identified.  The contracts provide criminal justice advisors, security personnel, life support, office and living facilities, vehicles, and associated equipment and supplies. 

The current contracts expire soon and INL intends to award up to five successor IDIQ contracts titled Criminal Justice Program Support (CJPS) that are of much the same nature in order to continue to provide this support.  It is expected that criminal justice support programs in Iraq and Afghanistan will be provided under other, separately awarded contracts.  It is possible that support to relatively small programs in those countries could be provided under the CJPS contracts.

This Request for Information (RFI) describes the Governments approach for a follow-on acquisition, CJPS, which builds on the CIVPOL program and expands the opportunities for wider industry participation.  The Government also expresses its interest in the participation in the solicitation process, either directly or as subcontractors, of smaller organizations with specialized capabilities and experience in various criminal justice disciplines.
The purpose of this RFI is twofold:
	Provide information to industry explaining the Governments CJPS acquisition approach.
	Solicit comments from industry which address:
	Acquisition approach
	Extent to which industry can meet the Governments requirements.
	Contracting approach
	Staffing
	Field support
	Pricing structure 
	Program management
	Transition requirements

Where responders differ with the Governments current approach as presented in this RFI, we specifically request suggested alternatives that would be equally effective in meeting the Governments objectives.

This RFI is being issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI.  Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and the Government's use of such information.

Respondents are encouraged to be as specific as possible in addressing any and all sections of the RFI and to provide suggestions for alternative approaches and solutions.  Feedback of a general or non-specific nature is less useful and will have limited utility in refining the acquisition strategy and impacting the content of the RFP.

Interested parties may respond to this RFI in accordance with the instructions provided in Table 6-1 of the attachment.

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity proposes to award to Hiroshi Ishida, Silver Spring, MD, on a sole source basis, a non-personal service contract to provide a Senior Scientist to develop and validate in vivo models that are predictive of the potential for test compounds to cause hemolytic toxicity in G6PD deficient human subject.   This is a continuation of an ongoing study on contract number W81XWH-08-P-0530.   Competing this requirement and awarding to any other source would result in substantial delays and disruption of a study already in place and would also increase the overall cost to the Government.  This procurement shall be under other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.    After the publication of this announcement for fifteen (15) days, solicitation W81XWH-09-T-0369 will be posted for five (days)at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/. The Point of Contact (POC) for this action is:  lottie.morris@amedd.army.mil.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity proposes to award a modification to Contract No. W81XWH-06-C-0414 with Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, Inc. (HMJF), located at 1401 Rockville Pike, Suite 600, Rockvile, MD, 20852, on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The modification will be for a period of six months to establish a bridge between Contract No. W81XWH-06-C-0414 and the follow on contract to be awarded under full and open competition.  The modification to the contract is for the continuation of on-site (Kenya, Uganda, and Cameroon) analytic and management support specific to the requirements of the DoD-GEIS and the U.S. Army Medical Surveillance Activity (AMSA) for the management and execution of the specified DoD Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Tasks outlined in the DoD Pandemic Implementation Plan.  Competing this requirement and awarding to any other source would result in substantial delays and disruption of these services already in place and would also increase the overall cost to the Government.  The Government believes that HMJF is the only contractor with the expertise to support the Department of Defense Global Emerging Infections Systems (DOD-GEIS) mission to guide our preparedness and response to an influenza pandemic with the intent of (1) stopping, slowing, or otherwise limiting the spread of a pandemic to the United States; (2) limiting the domestic spread of a pandemic, and mitigating disease, suffering and death; and (3) sustaining infrastructure and mitigating impact to the economy and functioning of society.  HMJF offers the unique capabilities to manage and provide oversight of the implementation of a program for a comprehensive DOD avian/pandemic influenza surveillance for pandemic influenza by offering the following to the Government: 1) HMJF maintains a leasing department that can procure needed space, conduct renovations, and outfit facilities to support a 24/7 operations center for avian influenza on a short term basis without encumbering the government to a long term venture which is consistent with the militarys leadership guidance; 2) HMJFs non-profit status serves as a cost saving measure to provide the support infrastructure to effectively manage a comprehensive worldwide surveillance program; 3) HMJF provides the administrative core staff for the management and oversight of the AI/PI program; 4) HMJF has established a communications center for coordinating the global surveillance and research efforts related to avian influenza/pandemic influenza (AI/PI); 5) HMJF provides surveillance capabilities for domestic and international monitoring, including efforts using the Global Emerging Infections System (GEIS).  Such efforts are integrated with other ongoing surveillance systems along with the integration of pandemic and response planning in the Department of Defense with the planning of other Federal departments, including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of State, and USAID; collaborating (as appropriate) with international entities engaged in pandemic preparedness and response.  Additionally, HMJF has demonstrated a capability for acceleration of medical research and development related to pandemic influenza.  This notice is not a request for a competitive quote.  Parties purporting to have the requisite credentials to perform these services must furnish in writing, factual information which clearly supports and demonstrates evidence that another source is capable of meeting the Governments requirements and that competition of the requirement would be advantageous to the Government.  If no written responses are received within at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this response, a modification to Contract No. W81XWH-06-C-0414 will be awarded without further notice.  The Point of Contact (POC) for this action is:  dana.herndon@us.army.mil .<BR><BR><BR><BR>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. <br />(i) All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 estimated amount of $500.00 is for evaluation purposes only and will be used to evaluate each offeror's proposal for taxes, fees, and surcharges. Upon award, the awardee must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Only those taxes, fees, and surcharges that are documented as applicable and allowable will be accepted; the resulting contract will be modified to add those actual fixed prices. Moreover, contract CLIN X004 must be modified for actual prices prior to the awardee invoicing for CLIN X004. The awardee may neither request nor invoice for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt and for any taxes not added by modification. <br /><br />(ii) The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs.

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1, including applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges added by a modification after contract award. The contractor may submit, on a yearly basis, a request for equitable adjustment for taxes, fees, and surcharges to include supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

<SUBJECT>Legacy for Children Longitudinal Follow-Up Study
<SOLNBR>2009-N-11192
<RESPDATE>071509
<CONTACT>Darlene Seminko, Contracting Officer, Email DSeminko@cdc.gov
<DESC><p>This Centers for Disease Control and Prevention solicitation is for the Legacy for Children<sup>TM</sup> Longitudinal Follow-up Study. Legacy is a multisite, randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the potential for improving child developmental outcomes through parenting programs designed to promote self-efficacy and a sense of community. Two research sites, the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), and the University of Miami participated in the study. The first contract was to implement the intervention and assess and follow the children prenatally or from birth until age 5. In the first phase of the study, 615 participants were enrolled into the study and randomly assigned into intervention and comparison groups. Eligibility was mainly based on indicators of low income and on geographic location.
<p>Some interventions that resulted in initial significant improvements in outcomes found the effect to fade at later age points (e.g., Infant Health and Development Program), whereas other interventions documented significant positive findings many years after the intervention was completed (Perry Preschool Project, Abecedarian Project). To properly understand the potential impact of Legacy for Children<sup>TM</sup> on children's long term healthy development, we must follow children beyond the preschool years.</p>
<p>The purpose of this new contract is to establish ongoing outcome evaluation for this early childhood intervention program (Legacy), following children into the school years. The goal of this study is to test the long term efficacy of an early intervention model intended to promote child development through influencing parenting behavior. Three assessment periods are proposed-- ages 8, 10, and 12 years-- in order to capture cognitive, behavioral and socio-emotional outcomes during the early and middle school-age years, as well as the beginning of adolescence. These assessment periods parallel those from other parenting intervention studies and are critical periods when learning and behavioral/ socio-emotional problems emerge. Identifying these problems and assessing the impact of the early parenting intervention on these key developmental outcomes is an important step towards prevention of childhood disorders.</p>
<p>Results from this study will provide data to influence state and national policies and to guide services for young children and their families. The collected data will inform the public whether these intervention services, delivered during the early years of life, can influence long-term educational and social outcomes such as school performance, employment, dependence on social services, antisocial and criminal behavior, and family unity.</p>
<p>The project being proposed is a phased contract consisting of three phases. <br />Phase 1: Preparatory work and start up, 12 months<br />Phase 2: Data collection and Assessment: 6-7 years<br />Phase 3: Project completion, 6 months, following completion of at least age 12, assessment</p>
<p>The proposed staff should have substantial research experience in childhood intervention with knowledge of applied research methodology. In addition the offeror should have experience in working with at risk and ethnically diverse populations; especially in determining appropriate assessment methods for maintaining sample size with these populations. The Principal Investigator should be experienced in child development; longitudinal research and evaluation methods; assessment methodology; data collection/management and be available for providing adequate input to the research activities.</p>
<p>The contractor shall, acting independently and not as an agent of the Government, provide all labor, supervision, equipment, materials, supplies, travel, transportation and perform all work necessary to perform the study.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a full and open competition. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Procurement and Grants Office (PGO). The CDC intends to select a single award from this solicitation for a cost plus fixed fee contract. The period of performance is date of award to March 09, 2018. All deliverables to be disseminated to the programs or the public will comply with Section 508 (29 U.S.C. 794d) standards and requirements of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p>The complete solicitation package is available for downloading. Contractors shall e-mail all solicitation inquiries and questions to Darlene Seminko at DSeminko@cdc.gov no later than Friday, June 26, 2009. Answers to questions shall be posted on Fedbizopps by Tuesday, June 30, 2009. It is the contractors responsibility to view additional postings and changes to this solicitation.</p>
<p>All proposals are due on July 15, 2009 by 5:00 P.M. EST. Please send an original and 5 copies (and one e-mail copy to DSeminko@cdc.gov) to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Procurements and Grants Office, Attn: Darlene Seminko, MS E-09, Suite 3723, Solicitation # 2009-N-11192, 2920 Brandywine Road, Atlanta, GA 30341.

SECTION K - REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companies ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.

Project Title: Use of Social Media to Supplement and Evaluate Risk Communication
Efforts with Respect to Food-borne Outbreaks

Background

When health hazards arise involving FDA regulated products, including human foods, pet
foods, drugs, vaccines and medical products, the public learns about them from media
coverage based, to a substantial but not exclusive degree, on information released from local, state and federal government agencies such as FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  In these situations, FDA strives to communicate appropriate hazard information to the public. In the face of often considerable uncertainty, FDA provides information on how to identify, avoid and control the immediate hazard as well as on its ongoing attempts to manage the hazard situation. FDA tries to responsibly balance the public health imperative to give the public needed information with considerations to not unduly alarm the public about the magnitude or extent of risk or to implicate innocent parties. These situations present an extremely difficult risk communication challenge, and FDA is continually trying to learn from previous efforts and improve its performance.

As part of their risk communication efforts, FDA and CDC issue periodic consumer
advisories on the Internet, refer consumers to government Web sites for detailed product
information, maintain dedicated blog(s) and/or other social media communities, as well as preparing frequent and timely press releases and conducting news briefings for electronic and print media.

In recent years, the rise of social media on the Internet, including especially user-generated content such as blogs, forums, message boards, wikis and podcasts, has created new opportunities to interface with the public with respect to emerging hazard situations
involving FDA-regulated products. The recent outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium due to peanut butter and peanut paste made at a peanut-processing plant in Blakely, Georgia
illustrates FDAs use of social media. As part of their risk communication efforts, FDA and CDC issued periodic consumer advisories on the Internet, referred consumers to government Web sites for detailed product information, maintained a dedicated blog and a Twitter device, in addition to preparing multiple press releases and conducting news briefings for electronic and print media.

The increasing presence of social media promises new capabilities to monitor the
effectiveness of FDAs ongoing risk communication efforts. However, best practice
recommendations for conducting effective communications are that communicators assess the impact of using various communication channels, especially new channels, to determine their value and how best to take advantage of these channels.

Objectives

The purpose of the study will be to conduct both historical and real-time monitoring and analyses of a representative sample of social media Web sites. The historical study will be about the early-2009 peanut products outbreak/recall (to be used interchangeably with outbreak henceforth) and the real-time study will be about two (2) unspecified and future food-borne outbreaks that occur in the United States within two (2) calendar years beginning from the award of the contract. The study should be designed to accomplish the following five main objectives.

1.  Identify mentions/references to FDA/CDC and other social media/internet sites and use this classification as a breakout factor for the analyses specified below.
2.  Identify the most frequently discussed threads or stories that appeared in the discussions on social media sites about the outbreak, broken out by time period and by type of social media site and by mention of the FDA/CDC and other social media/internet sites.
3.  Identify the main sources of outbreak information cited by participants in social media
discussions of the outbreak, broken out by time period and type of social media site and
by mention of the FDA/CDC and other social media/internet sites.
4.  Identify understanding of and reactions to consumer information that the FDA/CDC
provides about an outbreak, e.g., source and scope of problem and consumer advisories.
5.  Assess sentiments, comments, and suggestions about the FDAs and Federal
governments performance in managing the ongoing outbreak broken out by time period
and type of social media site and by mention of FDA/CDC and other social
media/internet sites.

This research shall  facilitate process and outcome evaluations of social media related to
FDA/CDC consumer advisories, recall lists, and other information.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  Based upon comprehensive market research including demonstration of CAM application software, the Government deems that only one source can meet ALL of the Governments requirements to match the machine tools in use at this facility, specific operations and rapid prototyping methods (to include importing the design feature tree along with native ProEngineering three dimensional solid models).  That source is DP Technology Corporation.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all proposals received by the due date and time in this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses received to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   However, the statement of work that applies to any award is available by clicking http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/Business/Divisions/Contracting/Acc_Announ.asp.  The solicitation number is W911W6-09-P-00XX and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Under this effort, the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) intends to award a commercial firm fixed price contract with an anticipated award date of June 26, 2009.  The intended source is DP Technologies Corporation, 8535 Cliff Cameron Drive, Ste. 112, Charlotte, NC  28269.<BR><BR>The Government deems the required programming software to be available only from DP Technologies because the ESPRIT CAM has the unique qualifications to meet the software requirement to match and integrate software with existing machinery owned by the Government.  DP Technologies is deemed to be the only vendor that offers all the following features to match the needs of the machinery and manufacturing environment:  a wire edm module that contains proprietary  Charmilles CT Expert technology database included in the programming process, a ProEngineering native file reader that will import native ProEngineering solid models to include the ProEngineering feature tree; a library of proven post and model simulators for the exact Mazak machine models used in this facility; an integrated mill/turn application that will eliminate the need to cut and paste from different operations; feature recognition capability of different geometry (holes, bosses, slots, windows, ledges etc.); knowledge based machining technology to include speed and feed and material library;  the ability to simulate the entire machining environment within the software to verify that the finished program will machine a part correctly thereby reducing machining operations and improving accuracy in the prototype parts. The listed features allow  prototype parts to be programmed quicker and more accurately.    In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b), the Contracting Officer has determined that, in the circumstances of the anticipated contract action, only one source is reasonably available that meets ALL requirements of the CAM software application.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to DP Technologies Corporation.    This synopsis/ solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32.  The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and is incorporated by reference. Please review the provision carefully to ensure that you are submitting all required information with your proposal.  Also in accordance with the provision, all prospective offerors must be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration prior to award.  A description of the services offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with requirements, to include product literature and warranty as applicable, shall be submitted. Offerors are advised to include a completed copy of FAR provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and CertificationsCommercial Items and DFARS Representations and Certifications 252.212-7000 with your offer unless representations and certifications are available electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 511210, Software Publishers.  The small business size standard is $25 million.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, the following evaluation criteria will apply to any proposals received:  1) Technical capability of the offeror to provide CAM software that satisfies all Government requirements to include ability to match and integrate with Charmilles wire EDM CT Expert technology database; ability to import native ProEngineering solid models to include the ProEngineering feature tree;  ability to substantiate that posts and model simulator features of the proposed software are proven for Mazak machines; integrated mill/turn application that will reduce the time and potential for inaccuracy from exercise of two separate operations.  Within the technical capability criteria, the Government will consider the extent to which the proposed software incorporates knowledge based machining technology and feature recognition capability.  The Offeror must state intent to comply with the Governments proposed statement of work (see http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/Business/Divisions/Contracting/Acc_Announ.aspor provide exceptions and rationale for any exception. 2) Compliance with schedule as stated in the statement of work; and 3) Price.  Technical capability and Schedule compliance when combined are of substantially greater importance than price  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders Commercial Items are incorporated by reference.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<BR><BR>This procurement is a 100% set-aside for Small Business Concerns under NAICS Code 811310 with a size standard of $7 million dollars.  The USACE, Engineer Research & Development Center, GSL-Concrete and Materials Branch have a need for the following:<BR><BR>Line item 0001:  Repair of a 1980 Caterpillar (electric) Forklift including parts, labor, pick up and delivery, Quantity 1, Unit: Lump Sum, Unit Price______, Total Amount_________ Not to Exceed (NTE) cost constraint. <BR><BR>Selected contractor shall have 30 days to pick up the forklift, perform all needed repair, and return the forklift to USACE-ERDC, 3909 Halls Ferry Road, Vicksburg, MS 39180.<BR><BR>Forklift Specifications and Suspected Problems:<BR><BR>-1980 Caterpillar (electric), Model M50B. The serial number is 35Y00855. It has 3,774 hours showing on the meter and has a 36 volt battery that operates the unit. <BR><BR>-Forklift brakes:  When pressure is applied to the brake pedal there is no resistance through the entire stroke of the pedal. Forklift does not stop when pedal is engaged. Probable cause could be master cylinder malfunction. Also, when the emergency lever is pulled back to engage the brake little is done in the way of stopping or parking of the forklift.<BR><BR>-Forklift mast controls:  When operating the levers that raise and lower the forks the reaction time is very slow. When operating any of the other levers such as, booming the forks front and back, adjusting the forks right or left, squeezing and separating the forks, the mast must be energized and in the process of travelling upwards. When there is a load placed upon the forks the above listed actions cease to operate at all. Probable cause may be the valve body located under the control levers is not allowing the proper amount of hydraulic fluid flow needed to activate the control lever selected or one of the hydraulic pumps may need repair or replacement. Since the above listed forklift is run electrically, the problem may lie in the electrical system in the back compartment.<BR><BR>-Forklift operators seat:  The seat where the forklift operator maintains control of the equipment has been broke in half, as well as the stitching is coming undone allowing the upholstery to tear and the contents and padding to fall out. The adjustment for the seat that allows the seat to move forward and backward is also malfunctioning.<BR><BR>-Routine forklift maintenance:  The maintenance on the above listed forklift is overdue.  All the hydraulic oil and hydraulic filters need replaced. All components that require grease needs to be serviced as well as in other fluid leaks that might be accruing.<BR><BR>Vendors:<BR><BR>-On site visits (not required) will be on 24 June 2009, from 0900 to 1100, for vendors to diagnose problems in order to provide a quote for the repair. All on site workers must be U.S. Citizens and Contractors shall provide names and social security numbers of workers prior to arrival on the job site.  Period of Performance shall be 30 days from date of award.  Discussions and questions are not allowed during the on site visit. Any questions shall be emailed to matthew.f.bell@usace.army.mil.<BR><BR>Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined to be Lowest Price Technically Acceptable.  FAR Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  Offerors must include a completed copy of FAR Provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with its offer.  FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

Quotes are due 1 July 2009 by 1400 hrs at ERDC Contracting Office, Attention: Matthew Bell, 3909 Halls Ferry Road, Vicksburg, MS 39180.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 
Washington, D. C. 20593-0001

<DESC><p>Question and Answer;</p>
<p>Question 2 - I was reviewing a question that was raised and an answer that was supplied and the answer is not consistent with the compliance requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;NFPA 1851 is the standard for cleaning, maintenance &amp; repair of firefighting protective clothing and no where in the standard does it state or reference installation of washers or dryers related have to be installed by specific people or anything to do with installation to be compliant. There is no where in the NFPA 1851 standard that references or suggest the use of dryers the only discussion area in NFPA about cleaning equipment is in the appendix section. Therefore installation reference being in compliance with NFPA 1851 should not be a consideration for contract award.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Answer 2 - Fire Departments must comply with NFPA standards and these standards do not apply to a contractor. However, contractor installed equipment must meet NFPA specifications.</p>

What are the requirements for sealed Microfocus X-Ray Source including vacuum, coolingsystem, high voltage generator, associated controller and software.Clarification: This is not a sealed type x-ray tube but demountable type.Answer: The word "sealed" will be changed to "demountable" by this modification.3. Microfocus spot size to 1 to 10 micron rangeAre you looking for a dual headed x-ray tube that allows you both thru transmission anddirectional?  Directional type tubes do not allow for focal spots less than 3-5 micron.Answer: In Requirements Change to: Microfocus spot size LESS THAN 10 micronChange is the capitalized portion.4. Company will provide on-site installation with minor training within 1 week of receiptof system at MSFCQuestion: What type of facility or Radiation enclosure is this going into?  What type of Safety interlock switch is available?  Do you want a new one quoted?Is this replacing an existing Microfocus system?  If so what type of mounting bracket will be available to mount the new tube head?Answer: There will be a lead enclosure to wrap around and enclose tube. This has beenanalyzed and sized for full output of this tube. When system is fully assembled,operation will be remote with room locked out. No new safety interlock to be quoted. Notreplacing anything, this is new. This tube will be positioned on a table with a plasticconnection to a collimator tube.5. Please confirm the kV?Answer: The maximum voltage is to be 225 kV6. Does the source have to be a sealed source or is an open tube/source acceptable?  Answer: The tube is a demountable source, not sealed, solicitation is corrected by thismodification.7. Is the x-ray system "sealed" or is this a continuously pumped x-ray tube?Answer: This is a demountable tube. It has its own pump system included.8. The RFQ states the controller is a PLC based device, but the spec sheet seems toindicate a PC based controller, can you specify?Answer:  There is a PLC controller included in the electronics control section. There isalso "user friendly" software that runs on PC. One can control x-ray source by talking toPLC controller direct with own software.9.  The spec sheet states power consumption of "208/230 vac, single phase, 60 cps, 10amps max". A pumped device will use more power than this to operate at full x-raygeneration. Is this spec correct?Answer: The power consumption of 10 amps on 208/230 volt source is correct.10.  There appears not to be any mounting guidelines, will the unit be mounted by NASApersonnel?Answer:  Unit will be mounted by NASA personnel.11.

<DESC><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (16 JUNE 2009)</p>
<p>Question 1:&nbsp; Is a specification sheet required for each CLIN to be responsive?</p>
<p>Answer 1:&nbsp; Yes, it is recommended that each specification be addressed in order to be considered technically acceptable.</p>
<p>Question 2:&nbsp; Is the award structured as all or none?&nbsp; Will there be split awards?</p>
<p>Answer 2:&nbsp; There will be no split awards - the award is all or none.</p>
<p>Question 3:&nbsp; How will the Government be paying out the contract if awarded?&nbsp; Would it be Government credit card, check, etc?</p>
<p>Answer:&nbsp; The contractor who is awarded will submit an invoice to the Government as well as DFAS.&nbsp; DFAS will then pay the contractor.&nbsp; You may visit <a href="http://www.dfas.mil">www.dfas.mil</a> for more information on how payment is received.</p>
<p>Question 4:&nbsp; The 1.5TB Firewire HD with the following specifications is no longer available.&nbsp; Is it acceptable to include the 2TB Firewire with the specifications that are needed?</p>
<p>Answer 4:&nbsp; There is no way for us to substantiate the claim that this size (1.5TB) is no longer being offered.&nbsp; Substitution is not acceptable if the size is commercially available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question 5:&nbsp; Attachment 1 (Technical Specs) lists a term MFBF.&nbsp; Is this supposed to be MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure)?</p>
<p>Answer 5:&nbsp; Yes, it should read MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure).&nbsp; MTBF = more than 500,000 power-on hours. This is the spec that OWC states it's Mercury Elite Al-Pro will perform. We are looking for the same performance. A common misconception about the MTBF is that it specifies the time (on average) when the probability of failure equals the probability of not having a failure (i.e. a reliability of 50%). This is only true for certain symmetric distributions. In many cases, such as the (non-symmetric) exponential distribution, this is not the case. In particular, for an exponential failure distribution, the probability that an item will fail at or before the MTBF is approximately 0.63 (i.e. the reliability at the MTBF is 37%). For typical distributions with some variance, MTBF only represents a top-level aggregate statistic, and thus is not suitable for predicting specific time to failure, the uncertainty arising from the variability in the time-to-failure distribution.</p>
<p>Question 6:&nbsp; What is the warranty requested?</p>
<p>Answer 6:&nbsp; A two (2) year standard warranty is acceptable.</p>
<p>Question 7:&nbsp; If drives require replacement, but contain sensitive data, what is the process to be used?</p>
<p>Answer 7:&nbsp; A replacement is expected when a drive fails to operate out of the box.&nbsp; If data is written to the drive and failure occurs, a replacement is not required or expected.&nbsp;</p>

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC><p>Q. In regard to the projection systems will the government be providing ALL the video equipment (switcher, computer, cameras, CCU, Vector scope, PVW monitors, etc...) and provide the contractor with (2) video signals (1 for outside screens and 1 for center (circle) screen)? Henceforth, the contractor will only supply 3 projectors, 3 lenses, 1 hanging bracket, 2 scaffold units, 2 screens, masking drape and all associated cables for this equipment only.</p>
<p>A. Contractor will provide three projectors (10,000 lumens min.), three lenses, required hanging brackets and scaffold units, video screens (two on the outside and one circle screen in the center with proper masking to prevent any imager spillage from occurring), masking drape and all associated cables. The government will provide two video signals (one for outside projectors and one for the center circle screen).</p>
<p>Q. Can the Moving mirror lights on the circle truss be replaced with 250w moving yoke?</p>
<p>A. No. The 250w moving yoke is too bulky for set design requirements.</p>
<p>Q. Can the circle truss be replaced with a 15' OD truss instead?</p>
<p>A. No. The 15 foot outside Diameter circle truss is too large.</p>
<p>Q. Is the contractor responsible for all the rigging- and will the government provide a CAD drawing of rigging points and load limits prior to the proposal due date of 6/18/09?</p>
<p>A. Yes, the contractor is responsible for all rigging. A CAD drawing of rigging points is not available. See the Statement of Work attachments for hangar 4 dimensions.</p>
<p>Q. Does the government want to use tungsten CYC lights or are they open to using LED based CYC lights?</p>
<p>A. The government requires contractor to provide tungsten CYC lights. LED based CYC light will not be accepted due to intensity and color saturation limitations.</p>
<p>Q. Can the contractor replace the 1kw PAR cans for the band with 750w SOURCE 4 PARCANS?</p>
<p>A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. When is the proposal decision date?</p>
<p>A. The contract should be awarded 3-5 business days after closing.</p>
<p>Q. What is the approximate budget for this project based on, perhaps, the previous year's event or anticipated expenditures from the US Government?</p>
<p>A. The government budget or anticipated expenditures information is not available to contractors. There was no Rodeo in 2008. The last Rodeo was in 2007. The 2007 Rodeo contract was awarded for $91,091.80.<br /><br />Q. Will the government supply housing and/or transportation for technical crew or is that the responsibility of the contractor?</p>
<p>A. No. The government is paying for just the service. The welfare of all contractor resources is the responsibility of the contractor.</p>
<p>Q. Is the intent for lighting/scenic to, essentially, use the same lighting/scenic design as the photographs (last year- I presume) or will there be a specific lighting/scenic design for this event? Will the contractor be responsible for any of the design portions?</p>
<p>A. The lighting design will be similar to prior show. However, the contractor will work side by side with show coordinator and will be responsible for all necessary lighting design variances to meet changes and updates as they occur.</p>
<p>Q. Is the panned audio referring to left/right right/left only or front to rear as well?</p>
<p>A. Panned audio is left to right or right to left.</p>
<p>Q. Is there a returning feed coming in via satellite?</p>
<p>A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. How many channels does the record truck want from audio - all channels, program, separately mixed program (aux/matrix feed), or other?</p>
<p>A. Separately.</p>
<p>Q. Where are the banners located?</p>
<p>A. See Statement of Work attachments for banner locations. We currently have only two banners, but we require the contractor to able to hang up to four banners.</p>
<p>Q. Where does the orchestra go?</p>
<p>A. Orchestra location is to be determined.</p>
<p>Q. Will the government determine microphones or is that at the discretion of the contractor?</p>
<p>A. Microphone types will be at the discretion of the contractor.</p>
<p>Q. What type of event is this?</p>
<p>A. Award ceremony.</p>
<p>Q. What are the attendees doing during rehearsals on 7/20-23?</p>
<p>A. The attendees are not related to the rehearsals.</p>
<p>Q. Why does it mention "backup rain location"? Will this also be set-up outside?</p>
<p>A. Contractor must be fully staffed and operational at 8 am on the morning of opening ceremony as the backup location for the outdoor opening ceremony in the event of rain.</p>
<p>Q. What is the distance in feet from the floor to the bottom of the beams?</p>
<p>A. Floor to beam distances vary from 20 to 80 feet.</p>
<p>Q. How many lifts and booms is the government providing for the set-up?</p>
<p>A. A min. of two 120 ft lifts will be supplied by the government. Additional scissor lifts and man lifts may be used by the contractor as availability permits.</p>
<p>Q. Is bridling the rigging points allowed and do you anticipate that being necessary?</p>
<p>A. Bridling is required due to availability of rigging points.</p>
<p>Q. The schedule is allocating 5 days for set up time- do we need to use all 5 days or can we use less time for the Audio and Projection departments?</p>
<p>A. Contractor will be advised to develop a written setup plan to help de-conflict other operations that will occur simultaneously in the hangar. All setup must be completed as prescribed in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Q. Are their milestones or things that need to be accomplished by a certain time during the set-up period- like sound check, truss flown, et al that could help the contractor determine labor requirements for the set-up?</p>
<p>A. Same as the above answer.</p>
<p>Q. What are the terms of this contract? Will the government be able to provide a deposit for this event?</p>
<p>A. All terms are stated in the solicitation. The government will not provide a deposit.</p>
<p>Q. Is this a yearly event, and if so- who was the contracted company last year?</p>
<p>A. This is not a yearly event.</p>
<p>Q. Does the contractor need to supply a FOH and MONITOR engineer for audio?</p>
<p>A. Yes, the contractor must supply a FOH, monitor, lighting and teleprompter engineer. In addition, an in house video tech, dimmer guy and microphone wrangler are required.</p>
<p>Q. Does the contractor need to supply any projection labor for the event or is the government running everything: live switch, broadcast switch, camera, video engineer, video director, etc...?</p>
<p>A. The government will provide the live switch, broadcast switch, cameras, video engineer and director.</p>
<p>Q. What are the dimensions of the room?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Original Synopsis Below.</p>
<p>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals for developing power-efficient and remotable high-speed analog to digital converters (ADCs) with high resolution. The proposed program (Remoted Analog-to-Digital Converters with De-serialization and Reconstruction or RADER) research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in analog-to-digital conversion. ADC systems enabled by RADER technology will be capable of operating in continuous time over a 10 GHz input instantaneous bandwidth (IBW) with a resolution of 10 effective number of bits (ENOB). Ultimately, it is desirable to be able to place the 10 GHz IBW so that input signals with frequency content of up to 18 GHz are captured. However, RADER technology demonstrations will focus on 10 GHz IBW at baseband (all Phases) in addition to 6 GHz IBW centered at 15 GHz (Phase III). Of particular interest is achieving these impressive goals within a dense input signal environment while simultaneously limiting the amount of dc power consumed to less than 50 Watts. Furthermore, in most applications, it is advantageous to sense analog waveforms at a point remoted from the components or subsystems that require significant portions of the power budget. The realization of such a continuous time analog-to-digital (A/D) system would create a unique new capability beyond the range of existing ADCs. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice. 
All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to DARPA-BAA-09-51@darpa.mil. See full BAA document attached.</p>

<DESC>** June 16, 2009 update:  Amendment 1 exending due date is posted **
The Federal Aviation Administration is seeking to establish an effort to cost share, on a 1:1 minimum basis, development of continuous lower energy, emissions and noise (CLEEN) technologies for civil subsonic jet airplanes to help achieve the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) goals to increase airspace system capacity by reducing significant community noise and air quality emissions impacts in absolute terms and limit or reduce aviation greenhouse gas emissions impacts on the global climate.  The CLEEN program is focused on reducing current levels of aircraft noise, air quality and greenhouse gas emissions, and energy use, and advancing alternative fuels for aviation use.  The focus of this effort is to: (1) mature previously conceived noise, emissions and fuel burn reduction technologies from Technology Readiness Levels  (TRLs) of 3-4 to TRLs of 6-7 to enable industry to expedite introduction of these technologies into current and future aircraft and engines, and (2) assess the benefits and advance the development and introduction of alternative "drop in" fuels for aviation, with particular focus on renewable options, including blends.

<DESC><p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) seeks to procure on a sole source basis a Cellometer Vision Trio cell profiler system with Nexcelom Bioscience LLC, 360 Merrimack Street, Building 9, Lawrence, MA 01843. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.5 01-(a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items. The North American Industry Classification System Code for this acquisition is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. <br />The NINDS Neural Coding and Computation Section (NCC) seeks to purchase a cell counter that can quantify the number of and strength of fluorescence protein expression in order to test expression and function of virus constructs. NINDS-NCC staff found that the Nexcelom Cellometer Vision is the only such cell counter that combines multichannel fluorescence intensity measurement of cells on a simple disposable counting chamber. It can rapidly count cells with a diameter range from 5 to 70 microns and a concentration range of 2.5 x 105 to 1 x107 cells using a minimal amount of cell solution. The disposable counting chamber eliminates cross contamination between samples. <br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 13.5.



This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-32.



The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541611 is set aside for small businesses only. 



1. TITLE  



Feasibility Study to help the National Institutes of Health Identify and maintain relevant Sampling Frames.


2. BACKGROUND 



The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research. Helping to lead the way toward important medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives, NIH scientists investigate ways to prevent disease as well as the causes, treatments, and even cures for common and rare diseases. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.  The NIH annually invests over $28 billion in medical research. More than 83% of the NIH's funding is awarded through almost 50,000 competitive grants to more than 325,000 researchers at over 3,000 universities, medical schools, and other research institutions in every state and around the world. About 10% of the NIH's budget supports projects conducted by nearly 6,000 scientists in its own laboratories, most of which are on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.  
NIH leadership frequently requires feedback and insights from various constituencies about the effects and operation of various NIH policies and programs.  Scientific societies, professional organizations, and advocacy groups serve as useful resources when seeking the views of constituents.  Additionally, the NIH has asked for input from advisory groups, has issued Requests for Information (RFI), and in cases involving the development of regulations the NIH has issued Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).  These approaches, however, may tend to filter out minority opinions and observations, and miss obscure facts.  Additionally, the input may not target or adequately represent the constituencies most affected by contemplated policy.  Finally, the comments are always unstructured and frequently difficult to analyze.      


3. Project Description 



The NIH seeks guidance related to the feasibility of developing general procedures for conducting surveys and for identifying and assembling suitable sampling frames to collect structured and representative information from constituencies of interest.  This feasibility study will help the NIH move quickly to identify and use existing frames or to develop and refresh sampling frames as required, and it will help the NIH assemble the resources necessary to develop and field suitable surveys that employ methodologically sound survey and sampling designs, power analyses, questionnaire construction, follow-up procedures that yield high response rates, data analytical strategies, streamlined OMB clearance procedures, and guidance on factors that will necessitate IRB review.

<DESC><p>GC09-1, NC GENERAL CONSTRUCTION MATOC<br /><br />Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC), for Design/Build or Construction type task orders. Task orders issued under this MATOC are anticipated to require performance of work predominantly in North Carolina. However, this does not preclude issuance of task orders which may require performance of work at other military locations, so long as these sites are located within the South Atlantic Division Area of Operations (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi). A project requiring use of civil funds or otherwise termed as civil construction is not authorized under this contract.<br /><br />This acquisition is being offered for unrestricted competition. The life of the basic contract is for a base period of three (3) years with two (2) one-year option periods or $499M; whichever occurs first. The pool size (number of contracts that may be awarded) shall not exceed six (6) contractors. The pool of contractors which successfully receive an award will share the total contract capacity of $499M. The Government will use a best value Performance Price Trade-off (PPT) evaluation process in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.101-1. The order limitation of task orders, to include the seed task order that will be used for evaluation purposes and award of the initial contracts, shall range between $5M and $100M. Task orders issued under this MATOC will be firm-fixed price. The initial seed task order may include options. <br /><br />Description of work: Task orders placed under this MATOC may be either of a design-build nature or that of a design-bid-build (construction only) nature. Work may include, but is not limited to, repairs, renovations, alterations, and/or additions to existing buildings such as administrative, recreational, educational, religious, medical, and training type facilities as well as their corresponding support facilities, or infrastructure such as roads, parking, drainage systems, utility systems, and force protection. Work under this MATOC may also include the design and the construction of various types of facilities including but not limited to, administrative, recreational, educational, religious, medical, and training type as well as their corresponding support facilities. Generally, however, task orders anticipated to be issued under this MATOC will be primarily for new, vertical construction and associated site work. <br /><br />Fort Bragg, NC - The scope of the seed task order, which will be the first task order awarded, involves the construction of a new Intermediate School (IS) to serve 725 students, grades 5 and 6. The school will be reinforced concrete and/or steel framing and will include general-purpose classrooms, art classroom, music classroom, computer labs, gymnasium, multipurpose room with stage and kitchen, specialists rooms, information center, administrative offices, teacher workrooms, and supply/storage rooms. The school will incorporate advanced communication systems to support technology program requirements, as well as general communications. The project scope will also include utilities, parking, bus loading/unloading area, playground, sports facilities, signage, fencing, landscaping, and security lighting. Handicapped access will be provided. Options may also be included in the seed task order. <br /><br />Evaluation Criteria: As this is a solicitation for a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC), a seed task order will be provided for purposes of evaluation and in rendering the best value decision. Only that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value of those offerors selected to be in the MATOC pool, if any, will also be awarded the seed task order. All other successful offerors, if any, will be awarded a contract with a minimum guarantee of $2,500. The evaluation factors and their relative importance of this solicitation and evaluation process are as follows: <br /><br />Factor 1 CORPORATE RELEVANT SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE, Factor 2 PAST PERFORMANCE, and Factor 3 TECHNICAL APPROACH NARRATIVE. Factor 4 PROPOSED CONTRACT DURATION AND SUMMARY SCHEDULE. <br />Factor 1 is more important than factors 2 and 3 and significantly more important than factor 4. Factor 2 is equal in importance to Factor 3 and more important than Factor 4. Factor 3 is equal in importance to Factor 2 and more important than Factor 4. <br /><br />Price: All non-cost factors, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.<br /><br />Award will be made to those Offerors whose technical submittal and price proposal contain the combination of the criteria requested that offers the best value to the Government. Proposals shall include sufficient detailed information to allow complete evaluation. The Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proof of acceptability rests with the Offeror.<br /><br />This solicitation will be issued in electronic format only.

<DESC><p>AFOSR has issued a 24 month, cost plus fixed fee&nbsp;contract, under the Recovery Act,&nbsp;for a research and development effort with a focus on developing new alternative green propellants for space propulsion and characterization of these propellants.&nbsp;In accordance with FAR 16.301-2, a cost reimbursement contract is suitable for this acquisition because the uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract. Furthermore and in accordance with 16.306, a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is suitable for this acquisition based on the conditions of FAR 16.301-2 being met.&nbsp;</p>

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<p>a. Acquisition purpose and objectives. This contract will result in the development of chemical sensors used for the end-of-service life application in personal protective equipment. These devices will be produced by applying nano technology that has been studied and matured over the past ten years. The system will utilize photonic crystals made from silicon which are etched with precise nanometer diameter channels. These crystals are capable of collecting organic vapors which can be related to breakthrough and thus reduction of protection to wearers of personal protective equipment.<br /><br />b. Project background. The University of California at San Diego (UCSD) has developed a chemical sensing technology over the past ten years which has proved to have potential as an end-of-service life detector for personal protective equipment. This has been proven by the work done jointly between NIOSH and UCSD since 2006. A number of colorimetric, thermal, and electrical sensors for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been deployed for carbon filtration bed end-of-service-life applications, each with limited success. Dye-based, passive colorimetric indicators are functionally limited by chemical group selectivity, restricting their utility as broad-class sensors for hazardous compounds like VOCs. Thermal sensors measure the local temperature of activated carbon which can rise by several degrees from heat released during adsorption of VOCS. However, thermal sensors for adsorption events are difficult to implement outside of a controlled laboratory setting and are ineffective at detecting the adsorption of small quantities of analyte over longer time periods. Electrical transduction schemes have proven to be good sensors in the past. Metal oxide sensors require large currents to operate at elevated temperatures, and many chemiresistor and semiconductor sensors contain supporting electronics susceptible to environmental stress and current designs retain a large form factor difficult to use inside a respiratory mask carbon bed. <br /><br />Fiber-optic-based sensors have been applied to a variety of remote sensing problems: measurement of pressure, humidity, vapor-phase chemicals, and aqueous biomolecules are leading examples. With a width of only a few tens to hundreds of microns, these sensors are impervious to electrical interference, require little power to operate, and can be multiplexed together into distributed sensor configurations. <br /><br />Many fiber optic sensors for organic and water vapors operate by detecting changes in transmitted light intensity. For example, published works include employing the fluorescence enhancement of an immobilized polymer to detect for organic vapors, immobilizing cobalt chloride on a plastic fiber to sense for water vapor in a colorimetric reaction, and sensing changes in organic solvent refractive indices with surface plasmon resonance at a fiber terminus. Fabry-Perot and interferometric sensors have been developed that utilize optical interference effects for optical transduction. These sensors monitor transmitted light intensity induced, for instance, by mechanical changes in a fiber by temperature or pressure. Fibers that were made porous have also been published in the literature. One study focused on a sensor that coupled a porous fiber with bromothymol blue to monitor transmitted light for ammonia detection. Another study coupled a ruthenium complex to a porous fiber to sense for oxygen by fluorescence quenching. <br /><br />The porous silicon tipped optical fiber sensor produced by UCSD is unique from the previously mentioned sensor systems in that the design senses by monitoring the wavelength of transmitted light as opposed to the intensity of transmitted light. Transmitted light intensity is susceptible to interference from optical loss, changes in the radius of curvature of the fiber, and mechanical vibrations. These conditions do not affect the wavelength of transmitted light. In addition to producing a reflectivity spectrum, the porous silicon layer provides a microstructure for concentrating analytes. The porous silicon surface can easily be chemically modified, allowing the opportunity for tailed surface chemistry and VOC preference.</p>
<p>3. Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value). <br />Project title. End-of- Service Life Indicators Using Porous Si Photonic Crystals<br />a. Project description. The proposed work would require collaboration between NIOSH/NPPTL and the University of California San Diego (UCSD) involving the development and demonstration of porous Si-based chemical sensors as end-of-service life indicators in respirator cartridges. This would be a continuation of the collaboration initiated in FY 2006. The University of California San Diego shall provide chemistry, materials design, and prototype device fabrication support to NIOSH. This Statement of Work (SOW) includes, porous silicon material synthesis, sample preparation, laboratory testing and characterization of materials alone and in prototype devices, as well as guidance for testing and use at the NIOSH facility and publications.</p>

The porous silicon surface can easily be chemically modified, allowing the opportunity for tailorable surface chemistry and VOC preference.</p>
<p>6. Description of the efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable. Indicate whether a FedBizOpps notice was or will be publicized as required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under FAR 5.202 applies. <br />An advanced search was conducted in the CCR database in effort to determine if potential sources were available. This search identified no potential sources.<br />Discussions were conducted with the Program Office to determine if potential sources exist. None were identified.<br />A FedbizOpps announcement was placed on March 13, 2009 announcing the intent to enter into a sole source contract with the University of California San Diego. There were no inquiries or interest generated from this announcement. <br />7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost/price to the<br />Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Part 15, other than cost or pricing data will be received. This information will be evaluated for reasonableness prior to award. Due to the dollar amount of the proposed action, an audit will not be performed.</p>
<p>8. Description of the market research conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the results, or a statement of the reasons market research was not conducted.</p>
<p>The University of California at San Diego was selected to collaborate on ESLI work in 2006 due to their advanced knowledge and research in the area of optical based chemical sensing. Further, they were chosen because they were receiving U. S. Air Force research funding under the Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative. By utilizing UCSD at that time, collaboration with NIOSH could be conducted without funding. This has continued until 2009. NIOSH/NPPLT has determined that it is in the best interest of the government to continue the advanced program development for ESLI devices by supplying first time funding.</p>
<p>9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>CDC/NIOSH has been collaborating with the University of California since 2006. The University has developed a chemical sensing technology over the past ten years which has proved to have potential as an end-of-service life detector for personal protective equipment.</p>
<p>10. Listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. <br />None <br />11. Statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the required supplies or services. This contracting office will continue to post all applicable actions to FEDBIZOPPS, search the CCR Database and conduct market research to determine if adequate sources exist.<br />12. Program office certification. <br />This is to certify that the portions of this justification that have been developed by the undersigned program office personnel, including supporting information and/or data verifying the Government's minimum needs, schedule requirements and other rationale for other than full and open competition, are accurate and complete. <br />Official Name &amp; Title Signature Date<br />Project Officer <br />Project Officer's Immediate Supervisor <br />Head of the Sponsoring Program Office</p>
<p>13. Contracting Officer Certification. <br />This is to certify that the justification for the proposed acquisition has been reviewed and that to the best of my knowledge and belief the information and/or data provided to support the rationale and recommendation for approval is accurate and complete. <br />Official Name &amp; Title Signature Date<br />Contracting Officer</p>
