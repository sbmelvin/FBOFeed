The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA San Francisco VA Medical Center intends to solicit proposals in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12 on or about March 6, 2016, with a closing date for proposals on or about March 16, 2016 from contractors in the San Francisco County, CA area, to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.

The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the proposal submission process.

<DESC><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description(s):<br /></span><br />The Program Support Center at the Department of Health and Human Services wants to identify viable 8(a) small businesses that are capable of fulfilling the objectives of this requirement for the Administration for Children and Families, Office of Head Start. <br /><br />This is a 8(a) Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: <br /><br />(1) the availability and capability of qualified 8(a) small business sources; <br />(2) whether they are 8(a) small businesses; <br />(3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. <br /><br />Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a 8(a) small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:<br /></span><br />The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) promotes the economic and social well-being of families, children, individuals and communities with partnerships, funding, guidance, training and technical assistance. ACF administers human services programs that address issues of low-income status, the needs of children and families, and social and economic risk. ACF seeks to enhance its ability to leverage its programs to address issues of racial disparities and inequality. To develop a strategy to build the agency's capacity to address racial disparities and promote equity, ACF's Immediate Office of the Assistant Secretary (IOAS) convened a Disparities and Equity Work Group.<br /><br />The Work Group examined what other human services agencies have done in equity and disparities work, and closely studied the Montgomery County Maryland Department of Health and Human Services' "Culture of Equity" model, which emphasized (1) an "equity lens" in all decisions, and (2) a shared language and process for equity analysis for senior leadership, supervisory, and nonsupervisory staff. The Work Group collaborated on a plan to adapt the Montgomery County Equity Lens model to ACF. This included identifying the current state of conversations about equity in various locations in the agency, as well as identifying potential strategies for delivering a training aimed at increasing the comfort and fluency of ACF staff with discussions of disparities and equity issues. The training and coaching process is not the entirety of the proposal, but is designed to create a cadre of committed equity-focused staff at multiple levels of the agency who share a common language and set of techniques for work on disparities in human services. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives:<br /></span><br />The Equity and Disparities Capacity-Building project is a pilot project undertaken by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Immediate Office of the Assistant Secretary (IOAS) to increase the capacity of ACF program staff to incorporate an "equity lens" in program planning and decision-making. One element of the project is the procurement of training, coaching, and professional development services from a vendor able to provide intermediate training to help social services/human services program staff to be more able to discuss and analyze issues of racial disparities and equity. ACF seeks a vendor able to deliver these training, coaching, and professional development services. <br />&emsp;<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Requirements:<br /></span><br />The purpose of this requirement is to provide training, coaching, and professional development to ACF staff participating in a pilot initiative to enhance participants' ability to apply a racial equity focus to programmatic work. <br /><br />Two ACF Program Offices will be selected to participate in the pilot initiative. Experiences and lessons learned related to what works and what doesn't work in efforts to enhance staff ability to discuss disparities issues and think through equity-lens approaches will help to determine future needs for the agency. Distance learning tools will be used to include both Central (Washington DC) and Regional Office personnel from selected Program Offices.<br /><br />A vendor will be procured by contract to provide specialized training and coaching for ACF staff participating in the project. The customization of training by the consultant will be in partnership with the ACF Disparities and Equity Workgroup and the Program Office Principals of the selected pilot Program Offices.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The training and coaching-focused effort will be in three phases:</span><br /><br />&bull; Introductory Training for Piloted Program Office Staff-Two Program Offices will be selected (based on volunteering by Program Office Principals). Staff in these two Offices will participate in a four-hour interactive training session provided by consultant personnel. Focus of the training will be on key building blocks for racial equity work; developing a shared language for racial disparities and equity issues; and introduction to a tool or process for racial equity work. <br /><br />&bull; Intensive Training for Interested/Volunteering Staff-After completing the introductory training, staff who are interested may volunteer/apply to be part of the advanced training. Participation is voluntary and based upon staff-identified interests, with an application process to select among interested staff to identify those best positioned to translate the advanced training into programmatic work. This training will presumably include leadership and upper management of the participating Program Offices. This advanced training is a 1.5-day long training, for up to 30-35 individuals. Focus of this more highly interactive training will be on more advanced skills with a racial equity analysis tool; determination of concrete actions that staff can take in their own work to advance racial equity; and proactive identification of areas for future TA and coaching. One critical outcome of this process is the creation of an Equity Work Team within each participating Program Office to support the Program Office Principal and Deputy with expertise and assistance in equity-focused efforts across the Program Office.<br /><br />&bull; Follow-up Coaching-Three monthly two-hour coaching calls at intervals following the intensive training, designed to be practice-focused and to promote continued application and development of equity concepts in ongoing programmatic work. Consultant teams provide expert coaching during these calls, which should align with key initiatives approved by the Principals of participating Program Offices for equity-focused work by the Equity Work Team within that Program Office.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anticipated Period of Performance:</span><br /><br />The anticipated period of performance shall be awarded for a 5 month period beginning 1 May 2016 and concluding 30 September 2016.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information submission instructions:</span><br /><br />No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE
<p>INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to negotiate and award a sole source purchase order to the First Data Bank, 500 East 96th Street, Suite 500, Indianapolis, IN 46240-3767 for the annual purchase of First Data Bank's National Drug Data File (NDDF) Tape, with Monthly Full Replacement Updates. The anticipated period of performance is for 1 base year and 3 option years. The sole source award will be made under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 235 ( C ) ( 1 ) as implemented by FAR6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies and Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. A justification and approval is currently being processed for this requirement. This requirement is intended as a sole source procurement because First Data Bank is a national drug information data base which contains current product, pricing and package information on commercially available multiple source prescription drugs. It is one of the three drug compendia companies in the country providing this data with no other sources available. Data from all three drug compendia are used in determining the Medicaid FULs for certain prescription drugs. The authority to set upper payment limits for certain drugs was provided under section 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act, and is established by regulation at 42 CFR 447.301-333.</p>
<p>CMS REQUIREMENTS: First Data Bank shall comply with the attached standards, policies, and procedures to be 508 compliant. CMS has been setting the Medicaid Federal Upper limits for certain prescription drugs since 1988. During the last two years the process has become more automated with the need for up-to-date drug data through commercially established sources. Since not all drug distributors list their products with each drug compendium company, it is necessary to procure each drug database from all known multiple-source national drug information compendia. These databases had previously been secured through CMS contractors, but will now be directly purchased by CMS.</p>
<p>NAICS CODES: The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 511140 (Directory and Mailing List Publishers).</p>
<p>INTERESTED PARTIES: All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. To be considered, interested vendors must submit technical literature describing their capability to effectively satisfy this requirement, as well as terms and conditions and a complete price, to the following electronic mail address: <a href="mailto:renee.wallaceabney@cms.hhs.gov">renee.wallaceabney@cms.hhs.gov</a>.&nbsp; Submit Quotes by Monday, March 21, 2016 by 2:00 PM EST.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: This notice is not a Request for Proposals or a Solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. This notice is not a commitment from the Government. The Government will not reimburse any bid or proposal costs as a result of this notice. No solicitation exists and requests for a copy of the solicitation will be disregarded. However, any future solicitation that will be open to competition will be subsequently issued on FedBizOpps in order to permit firms to respond.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>52.204-13 System for Award Management Maintenance (Jul 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<DESC><p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description(s):<br /></span><br />The Program Support Center at the Department of Health and Human Services wants to identify viable 8(a) small businesses that are capable of fulfilling the objectives of this requirement for the Administration for Children and Families,&nbsp;Immediate&nbsp;Office of the Assitant Secretary. &nbsp;<br /><br />This is a 8(a) Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: <br /><br />(1) the availability and capability of qualified 8(a) small business sources; <br />(2) whether they are 8(a) small businesses; <br />(3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. <br /><br />Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a 8(a) small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:<br /></span><br />The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) promotes the economic and social well-being of families, children, individuals and communities with partnerships, funding, guidance, training and technical assistance. ACF administers human services programs that address issues of low-income status, the needs of children and families, and social and economic risk. ACF seeks to enhance its ability to leverage its programs to address issues of racial disparities and inequality. To develop a strategy to build the agency's capacity to address racial disparities and promote equity, ACF's Immediate Office of the Assistant Secretary (IOAS) convened a Disparities and Equity Work Group.<br /><br />The Work Group examined what other human services agencies have done in equity and disparities work, and closely studied the Montgomery County Maryland Department of Health and Human Services' "Culture of Equity" model, which emphasized (1) an "equity lens" in all decisions, and (2) a shared language and process for equity analysis for senior leadership, supervisory, and nonsupervisory staff. The Work Group collaborated on a plan to adapt the Montgomery County Equity Lens model to ACF. This included identifying the current state of conversations about equity in various locations in the agency, as well as identifying potential strategies for delivering a training aimed at increasing the comfort and fluency of ACF staff with discussions of disparities and equity issues. The training and coaching process is not the entirety of the proposal, but is designed to create a cadre of committed equity-focused staff at multiple levels of the agency who share a common language and set of techniques for work on disparities in human services. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives:<br /></span><br />The Equity and Disparities Capacity-Building project is a pilot project undertaken by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Immediate Office of the Assistant Secretary (IOAS) to increase the capacity of ACF program staff to incorporate an "equity lens" in program planning and decision-making. One element of the project is the procurement of training, coaching, and professional development services from a vendor able to provide intermediate training to help social services/human services program staff to be more able to discuss and analyze issues of racial disparities and equity. ACF seeks a vendor able to deliver these training, coaching, and professional development services. <br />&emsp;<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Requirements:<br /></span><br />The purpose of this requirement is to provide training, coaching, and professional development to ACF staff participating in a pilot initiative to enhance participants' ability to apply a racial equity focus to programmatic work. <br /><br />Two ACF Program Offices will be selected to participate in the pilot initiative. Experiences and lessons learned related to what works and what doesn't work in efforts to enhance staff ability to discuss disparities issues and think through equity-lens approaches will help to determine future needs for the agency. Distance learning tools will be used to include both Central (Washington DC) and Regional Office personnel from selected Program Offices.<br /><br />A vendor will be procured by contract to provide specialized training and coaching for ACF staff participating in the project. The customization of training by the consultant will be in partnership with the ACF Disparities and Equity Workgroup and the Program Office Principals of the selected pilot Program Offices.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The training and coaching-focused effort will be in three phases:</span><br /><br />&bull; Introductory Training for Piloted Program Office Staff-Two Program Offices will be selected (based on volunteering by Program Office Principals). Staff in these two Offices will participate in a four-hour interactive training session provided by consultant personnel. Focus of the training will be on key building blocks for racial equity work; developing a shared language for racial disparities and equity issues; and introduction to a tool or process for racial equity work. <br /><br />&bull; Intensive Training for Interested/Volunteering Staff-After completing the introductory training, staff who are interested may volunteer/apply to be part of the advanced training. Participation is voluntary and based upon staff-identified interests, with an application process to select among interested staff to identify those best positioned to translate the advanced training into programmatic work. This training will presumably include leadership and upper management of the participating Program Offices. This advanced training is a 1.5-day long training, for up to 30-35 individuals. Focus of this more highly interactive training will be on more advanced skills with a racial equity analysis tool; determination of concrete actions that staff can take in their own work to advance racial equity; and proactive identification of areas for future TA and coaching. One critical outcome of this process is the creation of an Equity Work Team within each participating Program Office to support the Program Office Principal and Deputy with expertise and assistance in equity-focused efforts across the Program Office.<br /><br />&bull; Follow-up Coaching-Three monthly two-hour coaching calls at intervals following the intensive training, designed to be practice-focused and to promote continued application and development of equity concepts in ongoing programmatic work. Consultant teams provide expert coaching during these calls, which should align with key initiatives approved by the Principals of participating Program Offices for equity-focused work by the Equity Work Team within that Program Office.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anticipated Period of Performance:</span><br /><br />The anticipated period of performance shall be awarded for a 5 month period beginning 1 May 2016 and concluding 30 September 2016.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information submission instructions:</span><br /><br />No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response.
