<CONTACT>Dick Bolick Contract Specialist 7037871395     richard.bolick@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (GovWorks), intends to make a sole source award to Michigan State University (MSU).  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the United States Department of Agriculture Risk Management Agency (RMA). The Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) plan of insurance was first offered by RMA in 1999 in a limited number of counties in the Eastern region.  At that time, MSU entered into a cooperative agreement with RMA to develop actuarial procedures for the AGR program.  That agreement was in effect from May 15, 1998 until September 30, 2003.  However, RMA has determined that continued development of the AGR Program is necessary. This new contract is for completion of the MSU actuarial work.  Since MSU was the original designer of the actuarial process for AGR and has successfully administered this aspect of AGR for five years, their expertise is vital to the timely completion of the process.  Awarding the contract to another vendor at this point would most likely result in duplication of work, effort, time and cost to the Government.  To bring a new vendor in at this crucial time would impede the progress the AGR program; the learning curve for the new vendor would delay completion of the actuarial process by a minimum of one year.  The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  However, all information received within five (5) days of this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  POC:  Department of the Interior; Attention: Richard P Bolick, 381 Elden Street - MS 2510, Herndon, VA 20170.

<DESC>This is an additional update regarding the Traffic Flow Management Modernization (TFM-M) Program:  The draft Statement of Work provided with the Screening Information Request (SIR, also known as SIR1) in May 2003 had indicated that the contractor would perform a full hardware technical refresh as an initial phase of the TFM-M contract. Near-term performance concerns with the current TFM hardware platform require a change to this approach.  The TFM-M Program Office will initiate a hardware technical refresh of the existing workstations prior to award of the TFM-M contract.  The equipment configuration of the near-term hardware technical refresh has yet to be determined, but the details will be provided to the TFM-M offerors that have been determined eligible to receive the TFM-M RFO/SIR as soon as this information is available. The specific acquisition strategy for this near-term hardware technical refresh has yet to be determined. This change will be reflected in the upcoming TFM-M Request for Offer/Screening Information Request (RFO/SIR, also known as SIR 2) by the deletion of the hardware technical refresh requirement from Section C. Possible future refreshes would still be within the scope of the TFM-M contract.  There will be no specific requirement that the equipment deployed under this near-term hardware technical refresh must be retained after the system is modernized.  The reuse or disposal of existing TFM equipment will be based on the final design of the TFM-M system and will be in accordance with the mutual agreement of the TFM-M contractor and the Government.   Additional information on the TFM-M program may be found on the TFM-M web page at www.faa.gov/tfmmodernization.

<DESC>The scale and rate of urban growth of cities in India ,which has occurred largely in an unplanned way, has led to serious infrastructure deficiencies that reduce business productivity, deflect new investors, and compromise the quality of life for all income strata, particularly burdening the urban poor.

An annual resource gap of approximately Rs 17000 crores (US $ 3.5) Billion has been estimated for the period 1996-2006 in the water and sanitation sector alone. However, the problem of improving urban infrastructure delivery is not only an issue of money. Oftentimes local governments and other infrastructure project sponsors lack the capacity to develop good ‘bankable’ projects that can absorb capital resources from the market and be operated in a financially sustainable manner.

USAID/India’s response to the need for improved urban infrastructure service delivery is its Financial Institutions Reform and Expansion Project (FIRE-D) .Begun in 1994, FIRE
Project (Phases I and II  ,1994-2003) has established a position on the cutting edge of reforms in India’s water and sanitation sector. Project achievements; have served as key building blocks for the sector’s reform agenda. These include : the acceptance of the concept of commercial viability as a factor in water sanitation project structuring; the introduction in India of market based mechanisms for municipal credit rating and accessing domestic capital markets to finance urban infrastructure; raising the profile of urban sector issues in India and their systematic redressal; development of  Model Municipal legislation to fully implement the 74th Constitution Amendment on decentralization and devolution of powers to ULBs; ground breaking of  India’s first BOOT project on water sanitation in Tirupur; first pooled financing issue with DCA credit enhancement for financing water sanitation projects; initiation of municipal accounting reforms and promotion of state level city manager’s associations .

However, there is an urgent need for institutionalization of the reform process with support for consolidation, scaling up and replication of water sanitation project development and implementation with market based financing mechanisms being adopted in more states and cities.

Based on the lessons learnt from the FIRE –D Phase I & II and  feed back received from GOI and counterpart institutions ,USAID/India intends to continue to support implementation of GOI urban sector reform agenda through FIRE D-III (2003-2008) program ,which is designed to address :

- Sustainable state level institutional models for project
  development & financing
- Enhanced market based financing initiatives
- Increased project successes 

The ultimate objective of providing improved access of water and sanitation services in cities, particularly for the urban poor.

USAID anticipates awarding a cost plus fixed fee completion contract (CPFF) for 5 years under FIRE(D)-III program. Detailed information about this solicitation is contained in the RFP that will be available with the Regional Contracting Officer, USAID/New Delhi and shall be published in the Federal Business Opportunities web site http://www.eps.gov/.

<DESC>The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, through the Record Linkage Master Agreement Pool, is interested in awarding a master agreement order to provide new quantitative information on the relation between radiation dose and the subsequent risk of cancers of stomach, esophagus and pancreas and to generate new data on site-specific, age and temporal patterns of radiation-related cancers of stomach, esophagus and pancreas and the possible influence of chemotherapy and other factors.   This study is part of the larger effort of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics to identify, quantify and understand the risk of cancer in populations exposed to ionizing radiation, alone or in combination with other agents.  The study will also supply important new information relevant to clinical decision-making, as it will be undertaken in cancer survivors and constitutes the first analytic investigation of second gastrointestinal (GI) tumors, incorporating information on radiation dose and chemotherapy. 

The proposed study will focus on patients with a first primary diagnosis of Hodgkins disease, non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) or cancer of the female breast, cervix, ovary or testis, who survived at least one year after diagnosis.  It is envisioned that cohorts of patients with a first cancer at one of these sites will undergo computer linkage with registry reports of second primary malignancies.  Lists of these subjects will also be linked to mortality files to identify those who died from a possible second primary cancer and may not have been reported to the registry.  Information on initial and subsequent courses of radiotherapy and chemotherapy will be abstracted for patients who subsequently developed cancer of the stomach, esophagus or pancreas and for matched controls.  It is anticipated that large cohorts of cancer survivors (614,596 breast, 116,746 cervix, 92,209 ovary, 30,055 testis, 95,000 NHL and 32,199 Hodgkins disease) will be identified from several registries and that multiple awards from the Master Agreement Pool will be made.  It is expected that approximately one to two years will be required to accomplish the work described, depending upon the number of patients identified, the accessibility of treatment data and the availability of vital status information. 

This Master Agreement Order (MAO) RFP is available to all population-based cancer registries in the United States and in other countries who were awarded Master Agreements entitled, Record Linkage Studies Utilizing Resources in Population-Based Tumor Registries.  Those firms currently in the Master Agreement Pool have already submitted proposals which have determined them to be prequalified to propose for work issued under this mechanism.  Proposals will only be considered from offerors currently in the Master Agreement Pool.  Those who are not currently in the Master Agreement Pool and who wish to be considered for inclusion in the pool should consult the Research Contracts Branch Home Page http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/  click on Current Requests for Proposals, scroll down to Master Agreement Announcements and refer to RFP NO1-CP-01003-13.  The duration of the existing Master Agreement Pool is through July 30, 2005.  The due date for Master Agreement proposals is March 20 of each year for those interested in being included in the projected annual review.  It is anticipated that the Master Agreement Order RFP will be available on or about February 12, 2003.  Anticipated award date is August 31, 2003.  No collect calls will be accepted.

No further evaluation factors will be used in selecting proposals. The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offerors proposal, both technical and cost to determine the overall merit of the proposals. The technical aspect is ranked as the first order of priority and is significantly more important than cost, however, cost/price is a substantial consideration in selection of proposals for award. AFRL reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds. When requested, a debriefing will be provided IAW FAR 15.505 and 15.506. G. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: While the Government reserves the right to award a procurement instrument best suited to the nature of the research proposed, a Cost Plus Fixed-Fee, Level of Effort, IDIQ Completion and/or Level of Effort contract(s) of 60 months duration is anticipated. Should any award result in an IDIQ contract, the maximum ordering amount is only an estimate and is subject to adjustments that may be appropriate for the Government to take full advantage of the contract ordering period. In the event the Government is unable to conclude negotiations with the apparent successful offeror(s), it reserves the right to conduct negotiations with another acceptable offeror. The following deliverable types of data may be required subject to change upon contract negotiation: (a) Program Plan with updates as needed; (b) Monthly Status/Financial Reports; (c) Final Report, draft and final; and (d) Presentation Material as needed in conjunction with technical interchange meetings. It is anticipated that contractors may have access to or may generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This procurement is being advertised on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition.  This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction Contracts to the responsible proposers whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, cost or price and other factors considered.  AWARD MAY BE MADE TO A FIRM OTHER THAN THAT SUBMITTING THE LOWEST PRICE.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSAL RECEIVED.  THEREFORE OFFERORS INITIAL PROPOSALS SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFERORS BEST TERM.  This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices.  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor.  Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis.  The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction and renovation by design-build or (to a lesser extent) design-bid-build of Industrial Building Construction at various locations within Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Washington, and Alaska.  The North American Industry Code Standard is 236210 and the annual size standard is $28.5 million.  In support of design-build strategies, each Offeror shall possess in-house capabilities or employ the services of a Lead Design Firm (A-E) experienced in the design development and coordination of projects within the scope of this contract.  Offerors may offer multiple design teams to satisfy a variety of project types projected to be awarded during the term of contract(s).  The Offeror and the proposed Lead Design Firm(s) for the basic contract(s) will be evaluated as a team.  Lead Design Firm(s) (A-E), their subsidiaries and affiliates that are involved at the RFP or design stage of a particular project will not be allowed to propose or be used on a Task Order for that project.  After award of the initial contracts, each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, except under those circumstances described in the contract.  Should any of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award factors may be modified in order to ensure each participating contractor is awarded task orders.  The basic contract period will be for 12 months (or earlier as determined by the Contracting Officer after the government orders the maximum per contract amount of $100 million).  Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months or a value of $100 million, whichever occurs first.  The minimum task order amount for this contract is $7,000,000.  The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order.  The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $25,000 is guaranteed to be ordered to each awardee, under the basic performance period of the contract.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  The Two Phase Design-Build procedures of FAR 36.3 will be used for this procurement.  Phase One of the solicitation is in accordance with FAR Part 36.3.  Phase One evaluation will result in a determination of the most highly qualified Offerors.  These Offerors will be requested to submit a Phase Two proposal.  The maximum number of Offerors that will be selected to submit a Phase Two proposal is eight (8).  Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals by the Offerors selected in Phase One, which will be evaluated separately in accordance with Part 15.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  The Government reserves the right to substitute or add other Design-Build projects that meet the scope of the MACC, prior to the receipt of Phase Two proposals.  Selection for award will be based evaluation of the following:  Phase One:  Factor 1 - Past Performance of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 2 – Support of Small Business; Factor 3 - Experience of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 4 – Technical Approach.  Phase Two:  Factor 5 - Engineering Solutions of Offeror's Team; Factor 6 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).  The recommended subcontracting goals for the contract value (base and all options periods) are as follows:  8% - Woman-Owned Small Business; 10% - Small Disadvantaged Business; 3% - HUBZone Small Business; 3% - Veteran-Owned Small Business; 3% - Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business; 1% - Utilization of Locally-Owned Small Business (for work in remote areas); - and 27% Other Small Business.  Source Selection procedures will be used and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered.

Options to extend the period of performance for up to 12 additional months may be included in proposal plans but funding of such options is not guaranteed. CEROS anticipates that initial contractor selections will be made during March 2004 from submissions received by CEROS in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii by 12 PM Noon, Hawaii Standard Time, 12 November 2003.  However, properly formatted proposal abstracts received after initial contractor selections and before 12 PM Noon, Hawaii Standard Time, 29 March 2004 will be considered for award if funding is available.  CEROS will use a two-step submission process to formulate a Core Program from projects submitted under this announcement. The first step requires submission of a Proposal Abstract.  CEROS will evaluate all abstracts against the evaluation criteria herein without regard to other abstracts submitted.  For the second step, CEROS will request full technical and cost proposals from selected offerors for proposed efforts deemed as best qualified for potential negotiation under this BAA.   CEROS will specify the format for full proposals in the invitation to submit more detailed project information.  No selection for negotiation or subsequent funding will be made under this BAA without full technical and cost proposals.  Options to extend the period of performance for up to 12 additional months may be included in submissions to CEROS but incremental or follow-on funding of any such option is not guaranteed. CEROS may choose to fund such optional phases without additional competitive submissions from the offeror, contingent upon anticipated funding availability and results from the initial year’s effort and only upon specific recommendation and approval from DARPA.  CEROS may choose to fund all, some or none of the optional phases included in submissions in response to this announcement.  The commitment of out-year funding to optional phases will not exceed $1.0M. PROPOSAL PROCESS: To be considered in the initial contract award period, offerors shall submit an unclassified abstract of the proposed effort to CEROS in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, by 12 PM Noon, Hawaii Standard Time, 12 November 2003.  The abstract should provide an overview of the project and associated costs.   To be eligible for consideration, the offeror must be a commercial enterprise.  Abstracts should be submitted electronically through the website www.ceros.org/04baa_abstract.html according to the procedure described therein.  The submissions shall be prepared in either PDF or Microsoft Word 2000 for IBM-compatible formats and each project should have a separate submission.  Abstracts submitted by any means other than the specified website will be disregarded.  Abstracts shall be prepared in the following format: 8.5 x 11 inch plain paper, single or double spaced, in at least ten point type, with margins not less than one inch, and pages numbered.  CEROS will attempt to respond no later than 15 December 2003, to companies whose project abstracts are received on or before 12 PM Noon, Hawaii Standard Time, 12 November 2003. The abstract shall consist of a cover page and up to four additional pages of project information, including figures and tables.  Abstracts exceeding 5 pages will be rejected.  The Cover Page shall include the following: title of the proposed effort; intended product or result; name, company affiliation, phone number, fax number, and electronic and postal mailing addresses of the Principal Investigator and Administrative Point of Contact; proposed period of performance; funding required to produce the proposed products; names and affiliations of sub-contractors and co-investigators; and special requirements or considerations.  The balance of the Abstract should clearly describe the project’s Problem, Product, Process, Importance and Price.  The Abstract shall include the following sections, each clearly labeled: A.  Problem, stating the technical problem and Department of Defense (DoD) maritime technical need addressed, describing the technical rationale for the proposed effort, and summarizing the technical objectives of the work.

Specific funding depends on funding availability and out-year funding has not been defined. Multiple, firm fixed-price level of effort contract awards, not exceeding $1M each, are anticipated as a result of this BAA, contingent upon funding.  CEROS encourages proposals involving multiple entities (“teaming”) to leverage capabilities, develop technology in Hawaii, and address priority Department of Defense maritime technology needs.  Non-commercial, not-for-profit and/or government entities may be part of project teams but the team must be headed by a commercial enterprise.  Contract awards will be based on proposal merit and funding availability. CEROS may request that successful offerors deliver one technical presentation in Hawaii as part of the project. This solicitation will remain open for 180 days from the date of this announcement.  However, to be considered in the initial award period, a properly formatted abstract must be received by CEROS in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii by 12 PM Noon, Hawaii Standard Time, 12 November 2003.  Offerors responding to this announcement are wholly responsible for timely submissions. It is CEROS policy to treat all submissions as competitive information and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. CEROS may use selected contractors as special resources to evaluate abstracts and proposals. These contractors are restricted by contract from disclosing proposal information or using it for purposes other than the technical assessments for CEROS. By submitting an abstract to CEROS, an offeror agrees that the project’s technical and management information may be disclosed to selected contractors and evaluators for the limited purpose stated above or unless otherwise required by law. Any information submitted to CEROS that an offeror intends to exclude from such limited release must be clearly marked proprietary and submitted apart from other proposal material. All abstracts submitted under this BAA must be unclassified.  If offerors propose to undertake classified work or require access to classified information, they must be able to certify that they have a proper facility clearance, and key personnel must be certified as holding a Secret clearance.  Abstracts must clearly state that the proposed work will be classified. An invitation from CEROS to submit a full proposal does not assure subsequent award.  The decision to submit or not submit a full proposal is the responsibility of the offeror submitting the abstract. Successful offerors will be required to execute a State of Hawaii Contract for Goods and Services with the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority pursuant to its statutory authority provided under Chapter 227, Hawaii Revised Statutes.  The Contract General Conditions and Special Conditions, which may be viewed at the CEROS website, are subject to negotiation.  Pursuant to section 103-10, Hawaii Revised Statutes, contract payments shall be contingent upon the receipt of federal funds.

D. Supervisory Controls: The Senior Program Officer will supervise a staff of five CCNPSC employees.

E. Introduction and Background

Based on a management review of USAID operations in mainland Southeast Asia in May 2002, USAID decided to establish the Regional Development Mission/Asia (RDM/Asia) in Bangkok, Thailand to develop and support country programs in Burma, China, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam; to serve as a regional HIV/AIDS program center; to be a contracting hub (including for the $40 million USAID Mission in Cambodia); and to provide a base for disaster relief programs and regional initiatives such as anti-trafficking and the US-Asia Environmental Partnership (US-AEP) serving Southeast Asia.

USAID programs in the region to be supported by the RDM/A are varied.  They include economic governance; trade and investment; health and HIV/AIDS prevention, care, treatment and support; environmental management; economic growth; humanitarian assistance; democracy promotion and human rights; anti-trafficking; and disaster relief and mitigation.  To plan, manage and implement this program, in FY 2003 there will be a staff of about 21, comprising USDH, TAACS, US- and TCN- PSCs and CCNPSCs. The FY 2003 funding level for the total portfolio is approximately $72 million.


F.	 Basic Function of the Position

The Regional Program Office (RPO), a five-member unit, is responsible for strategy development, policy formulation, performance reporting, programming/budgeting of resources, project design and management, and public outreach to implement this regional development program.  RPO has primary responsibility for responding to requests from USAID/Washington, the State Department, the five U.S. Embassies in the RDM-supported countries, and USAID’s partners.  It serves as staff to the Director and prepares special briefing and itineraries for senior visitors from outside the Mission.  RPO’s work is high volume, fast paced, and highly critical for the overall reputation of the Mission.  RPO carries out a variety of analytic, reporting and program tasks and produces high quality products within a short time frame.  RPO staff members have to be flexible, able to work under pressure, personally responsible for the quality of their work and effective team members.  Significant travel is required by the US and senior CCN staff to provide oversight and management support for the programs over this wide geographic area.  Maximum use is made of virtual teams with USAID/Washington.

As of June 2003, a senior U.S. Direct Hire Supervisory Program Officer has been assigned to head the RPO.  However, in the absence of both a Mission Director and a USDH General Development Officer for an indefinite period of time, that USDH Program Officer will also serve in both these capacities until officers are assigned permanently to those positions.  Thus, he will not be able to devote more than a fraction of his time to supervision of the RPO.  


F.	Statement of Duties and Specific Responsibilities:

Working in close collaboration with the Acting Mission Director, the Senior Program Officer’s responsibilities will include:


1.	Lead the drafting, editing, and finalization of key mission-wide strategic planning and reporting documents, including the annual Congressional Budget Justification, the Annual Report, and RDM/A input into the Asia/Near East Bureau Program and Budget Submission (BPBS).  In this capacity, s/he will review technical office input and provide editorial and programmatic guidance in response.

2.	Organize a series of two-three day meetings on the principal sectors in which the RDM/A is active; i.e., economic governance, trade and investment, health, environmental management, and democracy promotion and human rights/anti-trafficking.  These meetings will assemble representatives from all the key actors in these sectors in mainland Southeast Asia, including USAID missions, U.S. Embassies, host country governments, other donors, and other partners (e.g., non-governmental organizations and private voluntary organizations).  The purpose of these meetings will be to:

•	Develop an inventory of all ongoing and proposed donor- and host-country funded activities in each sector;
•	Assess and discuss which of these planned approaches are best undertaken bilaterally and which are best undertaken regionally; and
•	Develop an initial estimate of the major results to be achieved in each sector over the next three years.

3.	Based on the results of these meetings, lead the development of a series of three-year regional USAID “action plans” for each sector.  These plans will specify:

•	Which USAID entities and partners are to undertake which activities through the regional programs managed by the RDM/A;
•	What results are to be achieved by those activities; and
•	What human and financial resources are required to achieve those results

4.	Serve as the RDM/A’s monitoring and evaluation specialist, assuming primary responsibility for all monitoring and evaluation aspects of the mission's portfolio, including customer service information and the development of performance monitoring plans for all programs managed by the RDM/A.  In this capacity, s/he will work in close collaboration with technical offices both in USAID/Washington and in the RDM/A itself.

5.	Serve as RDM/A’s public information specialist; i.e., prepare briefing materials, document success stories, draft talking points for senior USAID and/or Embassy officials, write press releases, and develop a coordinated mission public outreach program.  In this capacity, s/he will work closely with the US. Embassy Public Affairs Office.

6.	Provide oversight, training, support, and mentoring to all other members of the RPO staff.

7.	Participate in the study and analysis of the economic, social and political developments of countries for which the Mission is responsible and the impact of program proposals toward achieving objectives.

8.	Provides information on the political, social and cultural aspects of Southeast Asia countries, utilizing key host country contacts as appropriate, and advise the Acting Mission Director on country affairs as needed.


G.	Required Qualifications:


1.	Education: The qualified person must have a university degree in a relevant field such as public administration or the social sciences.  An advanced degree, including thesis or dissertation, is preferable.

2.	Prior Work Experience: A minimum of five years' experience in international development, project monitoring and reporting, professional writing, or, a combination of these, is needed.  This is a mid level position that requires an ability to function independently.  The incumbent must have demonstrated ability to manage a series of simultaneous new and ongoing activities, must be able to accomplish a wide range of assignments on short notice, and should ideally have prior successful experience in the design and evaluation of major donor-funded development programs.

3.	Interpersonal and Communication Skills: Excellent oral and written communication skills are essential.  The incumbent must also have demonstrated ability to work in a collegial and persuasive fashion that is action oriented.  Strong quantitative and analytical skills, computer literacy for document and report preparation, and the ability to communicate technical information clearly and effectively to both technical and non technical colleagues are required. It is also crucial that the incumbent possesses an excellent ability to work cohesively with other local and international organizations and contractors, and the ability to promote and preserve staff morale and performance under rapidly changing conditions.

4.	Language Skills: Fluent English language required.  The ability to communicate in Thai and/or another language native to Southeast Asia would be a plus.


H. Period of Service

Initially, the period of performance will be for a period of one year with possibilities of extension. The incumbent is expected to begin work in USAID/Thailand on or about October 1, 2003.
 

J.	POST ENTRY TRAINING: The incumbent is expected to possess the necessary technical training and management skills/abilities required to carry out/perform the duties/responsibilities required of the position.  Post entry training will, therefore, be focused primarily on Agency-specific policies, procedures and regulations that govern USAID-specific Cognizant Technical Officer responsibilities/duties and USAID-specific activity management systems.  In addition, the incumbent will be required to work within the existing and future USAID/Thailand team management office structure. Organized training (both internal & external) may be provided from time to time depending on the availability of Program funds and as determined to be in direct support of USAID Thailand Regional activities.

K. LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY: Native Speaker (Level 5) in both written and spoken English is required.  Demonstrated excellence in oral and written communication, including the ability to evaluate and interpret reports, effectively communicate USAID’s mission to the general public and deliver presentations before large and varied audiences is required. Given the nature of the position, effective written and oral communications are absolutely critical to perform successfully in this position.

L. SKILLS AND ABILITIES: Proven ability to work independently with minimal supervision or guidance is required. Strong interpersonal skills are required to establish and maintain excellent contacts with counterparts both inside and outside of USAID, and with contractors and grantees, in order to explain USAID project/program policies, objectives and procedures as well as relevant U.S. government legislation is required. In the same vein, must be able to transmit and interpret host country government and non-governmental sector program-related concerns to senior USAID officials and Mission management. 


M. EXERCISE OF JUDGEMENT: Excellent (balanced) judgement is required in working effectively with senior officials from both public and private sectors as well as the donor and private sector communities and within the U.S. Embassy in overseeing regional program activities and coordinating multi-sectoral  efforts in support of USAID’s development objectives, and in collecting, analyzing and reporting on progress of activities and recommending actions.  The incumbent will also be required to follow and adhere to the Agency’s Code of Ethics and Conduct. 

N. AUTHORITY TO MAKE COMMITMENTS: The incumbent will have no independent authority to commit U.S. Government (USG) or Mission (USAID/RDM/A, Thailand) funds on behalf of the U.S. Government or the Regional Missions. 

O. TIME REQUIRED TO PERFORM THE FULL RANGE OF DUTIES AFTER ENTRY INTO THE POSITION: The incumbent is expected to possess the necessary technical, administrative and management skills and abilities required to carry out the duties and responsibilities required of the position.

P.	 OTHER REQUIREMENTS

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  This Request for Quotation (DTCG87-04-Q-643015) incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14 and is issued as a 100 percent small business set-aside.  The contract will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.  The procurement will be awarded as a firm-fixed-price contract.  The intent of this project is to replace a damaged guy insulator 5-A-twr#3-2 and mount an FM antenna system on Tower #4 at LORSTA Tok.  This sectionalized LORAN-C SLT antenna system consists of four identical cable panels supported by four 700-foot towers. 
The antenna wire array is directly energized by the Loran-C transmitter. Large voltage differences exist between array and ground or metallic devices within the electromagnetic (EM) field. Support towers, backstays, and electrical guys are insulated from the direct Loran-C transmitter voltage by the corner point insulators, but they nevertheless are at some voltage level above that of ground because of the EM field, and triboelectric effects caused by wind, snow, etc.  Each galvanized steel tower has a 7-foot face width and is supported by three lanes of nine insulated guys.  The insulator that needs to be replaced is on Guy Level 5, Lane A, second insulator from the top.  The FM antenna system consists of (2) ERI 1105-2a antennas with radomes.  The pair of antennas will be connected with a dipole approximately 10’ in length.  The antenna system shall be mounted between 170’ and 140’.  Maintenance Items:  Rig a temporary structural guy and replace insulator on Tower #3, Guy Level 5, Lane A, second insulator from the top.  Install FM antenna system on Tower # 4.  Complete a written report summarizing all of the work.  All inspections, adjustments to tower alignments and guy tensions shall be performed by a Registered Professional Civil or Structural Engineer or by a Professional meeting the following criteria:  Minimum of five years experience erecting or inspecting towers and minimum of two years experience working on guyed towers of 500 feet or greater and minimum of two years as a supervisor of tower inspection and maintenance work and experience in measuring and correcting tower alignment, guy tensions, and twist.  Reports shall be performed by a Registered Professional Civil or Structural Engineer.  The same registered engineer shall be available to provide technical guidance to personnel performing the tower inspection, alignments and tensions.  The contractor shall comply with all Coast Guard safety standards as described in COMDTINST M11000.4A, U.S. Coast Guard Tower Manual, 2002. Weather history at Tanacross as follows:  Mean Daily Max/Min Temperature (October): 36°F/21°F.  Mean Daily Max/Min Temperature (November): 10°F/-4°F.  Work aloft shall not be carried out when the ground wind exceeds 20 mph, electrical storm activity is present, or fog obscures clear visibility between the ground and the top of the tower.   A written notice of acceptance issued by the Contracting Officer will establish the completion of this contract.  The COR will conduct a final inspection when the Contractor is finished with project work and will determine if all work satisfies the contract requirements. Discrepancies or omissions, if found, will be noted.  Comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning environmental pollution prevention, control, and abatement. Comply with all applicable provisions of the Corps of Engineers Manual, EM 385-1-1, entitled “General Safety Requirements”, which are in effect on the date of solicitation.  Quarters and Messing will not be provided.  Any existing materials which are removed and not reused shall be retained on-site at a location designated by the COR.  Scrap materials and debris shall be disposed of in a designated disposal area or removed from Government property, all at the Contractor’s expense.  TEMPORARY SERVICES AND UTILITIES:  Coordinate the use of temporary services and utilities with the COR. Potable Water and Electrical Power will be provided by the Coast Guard.  The contractor shall provide all other temporary services, utilities, and equipment required to complete the work.  The Contractor shall be fully responsible for the security of all stored material and equipment, and shall provide any security measures he deems necessary, at his expense.  Prior to the commencement of work, submit to the COR a complete list of all employees, representatives, and subcontractors, including name, age, and address. MAINTENANCE:  Measure initial alignment of Tower #3.  Rig temporary structural guy at 5-A-twr#3 and tension appropriately.  Replace insulator on Tower #3, lane A, guy level 5, second from the top.  Adjust guy wire to appropriate tension and measure alignment.  Mount an FM antenna system consisting of (2) ERI 1105-2a antennas with radomes on Tower #4, leg A.  REPORT:  Complete a written report summarizing all of the work and the alignment data. SUBMITTAL:  Execution plan for replacing insulator. Rigging: Supply all materials, including temporary guy, blocks, harnesses and safety devices, and all other devices required for rigging.  Haul Vehicle:  Supply haul vehicle for evolution as needed. Camera Equipment: Supply cameras and all film needed to fulfill photo requirements.  High-Powered Telescopic Viewing Equipment:  Supply a Questar telescope or equivalent to inspect guy and insulators. Transit: Supply a transit to measure alignment.  Transit must be calibrated within six months of project work.  Submit a copy of the calibration certificate.  Communications:  Provide reliable radio communications.  Continuous contact between the ground and inspection crew is required. Tensioning Equipment:  Supply tensioning equipment.  Dynamometer must be calibrated within six months of project work.  Dynamometer may have a maximum reading capability of 15000 lbs with incremental measurements of not more than 100 lbs. TENSIONS AND ALIGNMENT:  Tensions:  Measure initial guy tension of 5-A-twr#3.  Following tower maintenance set tension to appropriate level and record final tension according to below.  Alignment:  Measure and record tower alignment by the “one leg” method.  Following tower maintenance align the tower as necessary using tension adjustments described herein.  If the alignment is within parameters it is not necessary to measure and record tensions on the entire tower.  If the alignment of tower #3 is not within parameters, measure all tensions and adjust accordingly to bring tower alignment within parameters.  GUY TENSIONS:  Procedures:  Measure and record initial guy tension.  Guy tensions shall be measured using a dynamometer, hand winch and guy grip.  Adjust the tension so that guy tension, alignment, turnbuckles, and twist are all set to design levels.  If after final adjustment the turnbuckle does not afford at least 1.0 inch of adjustment, it shall be repositioned with a new PLP dead end guy-grip. Tolerances:  No tensions outside of design tolerances will be permitted.  Design tolerances are –5% to +15% of the values in the Guy Tensions Temperature Correction Chart. Conditions:  Gradual Corrections Required:  If realignment is necessary, no guy level shall be pulled more than two inches out of alignment as compared with the guy levels immediately above and below the level being realigned.  Wind:  Ground wind speed must be less than 10 knots during tension measurements.  ALIGNMENT MEASUREMENTS AND PLOTS:  Three transit positions must be used.  With respect to the tower, the positions are 60 degrees apart. (60 degrees between P1 and P2; 60 degrees between P2 and P3).  Care must be taken to take readings on the correct leg at each position.  After leveling the transit, sight the edge or center of the leg near the base of the tower and lock the horizontal motion.  Estimate deflections at each guy level.  (Leg diameters are listed on the alignment readings data sheet in Appendix B.)  Invert scope and repeat.  Average the readings.  Repeat for each leg.  Record and plot the readings.  Ground wind speed must be less than 10 knots during alignment.  Each set of averaged readings at a guy level shall be plotted to fix the position of the tower relative to true vertical.  The fix is formed by the position lines of the three legs. Under ideal conditions, the plotted fix should be a point.  If the fix instead results in a triangle and the triangle is plotted larger than 1½ inches at plot scale in its greatest dimension, that particular level of shots shall be repeated and re-plotted.  The distance from true vertical (zero along each axis) to the tower’s actual location (plotted) shall be calculated for each level and compared to the acceptable tolerances.  After the tower is aligned and guys are tensioned correctly, final alignment readings shall be taken and recorded.  The plot and all data shall be included with the final report.  REPLACE GUY INSULATOR (5-A-twr#3-2):  Following the measurement of initial tension of 5-A-twr#3 and alignment of tower #3, rig temporary guy and replace damaged insulator in accordance with the approved procedures.  The procedures shall be stamped by a registered professional engineer and approved by the Coast Guard. The broken insulator is on Tower #3, Guy Level 5, Lane A, second from the top.  It is located approximately 50’ down the guy wire from the guy takeoff point.  The Coast Guard will provide the replacement insulator and guy grip.  Adjust guy wire to appropriate tension.  Record the final tension and alignment data.  If tower is not within alignment parameters, make the necessary adjustments to bring within tolerance. INSTALL FM ANTENNA:  The FM antenna system consists of (2) ERI 1105-2a antennas with radomes.  The pair of antennas will be connected with a dipole approximately 10’ in length.  The antenna system shall be mounted between 170’ and 140’ on leg A.  The Coast Guard will furnish the antennas, radomes, and miscellaneous connecting hardware.  Establish signal to the antenna system by installing ½” heliax cable from the junction at ground level to the base of the antenna.  Connect ½” heliax to the antenna via the furnished flange.   Ground the antenna system to the tower.  The Coast Guard will provide the cable, tape, grounding hardware, and any miscellaneous materials needed to affix the cable to the tower. Replace the u-bolts on an identical antenna system mounted on leg C of the same tower between 170’ and 140’.  The Coast Guard will provide the u-bolts.  Submit three (3) copies of the final report to the Contracting Officer within 15 working days after completing work at the site.  Also submit one CD-Rom containing the report.  All pages shall be bound in loose-leaf binders.  All data and plots for alignment of tower #3 shall be submitted.  Tension readings shall be recorded as necessary in lbs. after adjustments are made.  All data shall include date, weather conditions, and instrument type.  Include a summary of all work completed.  Upon completion of the required maintenance all rigging shall be removed from the tower.  All debris resulting from this contract shall be removed from the antenna field.
