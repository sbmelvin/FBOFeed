calendar day period, from issuance of the Notice to Proceed (NTP). This procurement is restricted and is a 100% 

total set-aside for SBA certified Small Business Concerns only.  The procurement method for this requirement shall 

use the evaluation procedures outlined IAW FAR Subpart 13.106-2.  An award shall be made to the proposal that is 

evaluated to provide the best value to the Government for this effort utilizing the Trade-Off method approach.  

This approach provides that noncosts/nonprice factors are more important than costs/price factors.  A two phase 

Down-Select Process will be employed to identify prospective offerors that possess the required qualifications for 

this effort, in which they will be issued a solicitation inclusive of the full plans and specifications of the 

project.  The first phase of the down selection process will require interested parties to submit a completed 

questionnaire document (attached) entitled "STATEMENT OF AUDIO VISUAL INTEGRATOR and DATA VOICE CABLING 

QUALIFICATIONS" for initial evaluations.  The evaluation criteria for the first phase include but may not limited 

to:  (1) Relevant Past Experience, (2) Management Approach/Team, (3) company and team industry and manufacturer 

certifications, and (4) financial stability. The offeror's completed questionnaire will be graded against an 

established point grading scheme, with a 180 points maximum.  Those offerors whose graded scores are in the top 20 

percentile will be qualified, and will be directly invited to participate in the second phase of the down selection 

process.  Those offerors that do not qualify shall be formally notified by the cognizant Contracting Officer of 

their scores accompanied with a breakout of their scores.  The second phase proposal submission includes the Price 

and ancillary materials/equipment list proposal to be submitted by the qualified offeror(s) in the first phase of 

the down selection, for evaluation of proposed equipment/material and price considerations.   PLEASE NOTE:  Only 

qualified offeror(s) will receive a request for an equipment/material list and price proposal.  Any proposals, 

received from any offeror(s) in response to the RFP, who were not previously qualified, nor participated in the 

first phase of the down-select process, will not be reviewed for this requirement.  OFFERORS SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT 

DISCUSSIONS WILL TAKE PLACE AS THE CONTRACTING OFFICER RESERVES THE RIGHT TO AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS; 
THEREFORE, ALL OFFERORS SHOULD SUBMIT THEIR BEST PRICE AT THE PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PHASE. All small business firms are 

encouraged to JOINT VENTURE if desired. Upon award, the awardee shall submit Performance and Payment Bond in the 

Penal Sum of 100% of the initial contract price. For purposes of this procurement, a concern is considered a small 

business if its annual average gross revenue, taken for the last 3 fiscal years, does not exceed $28.5M. This 

solicitation is not a competitive open bid and there will not be a formal public bid opening. The magnitude of the 

construction project is between $1,500,000.00 and $2,000,000.00. A SITE VISIT/PRE-PROPOSAL CONFERENCE is scheduled 

for on/about the week of 25 Feb 2008 at which time qualified offerors will be allowed to examine the site and 

propose questions as well. Plans and specifications will be available on or about 22 Feb 08 and proposals due 

on/about 14 Mar 2008. Plans and Specifications may be examined at 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1809, New York, N.Y.

accordingly, the solicitation will be issued via Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. Required 

Central Contractor Registration (CCR) applies to this procurement. To be eligible for award prospective contractors 

must be registered in the CCR Database prior to award. Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an

The government does not have the test capability, evaluation criteria, or technical documentation available to make a determination of acceptability of replacement parts by any other manufacturer.  In addition, this requirement is a single source because the FAA is installing this equipment on their Beech-300 Flight Inspection Aircraft.  As such all component parts must be type certificated in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulation procedures set forth under Certification Parts 23, 25, 27 and 29 which states "For new, amended and supplemental type certificates (STC) under 14 CFR Parts 23, 25, 27 and 29, the cognizant FAA Aircraft Certification Officer (ACO) will issue special conditions that require the applicant comply.

Potential sources must provide documentation to the FAA showing proof of rights to use the data from the OEM. Statements that data will be obtained or that specifications or drawings will be developed are not acceptable. Only those responses providing the required documentation in response to this market survey will be considered prior to further action by the FAA.

<DESC>This effort was originally synopsized under number FA8530-07-R-F2AST.  All future postings for this effort will be posted under FA8530-08-R-21758.

The Future Flexible Acquisition & Sustainment Tool (F2AST) is intended to meet the needs of AFMC Program Directors and Single Managers for speed and flexibility by providing a multi-dimensional task ordering capability, and sufficient ceiling and scope for command (AFMC) - wide usage.  F2AST is intended to be an optional contracting tool that will effectively provide acquisition and sustainment support for all Air Force managed weapon systems and support systems, line replaceable units, shop replaceable units and components.  F2AST will establish the means for the procurement of requirements to include modifications (hardware & software) for the enhancement of reliability, serviceability, maintainability, and performance.  Additionally, the program/contract(s) will include, improved/expanded form/fit/function development programs, procurement of previously owned aircraft, depot partnering opportunities, and maintenance.  F2AST may include spares and repairs which qualify as critical, limited and/or contingency and sole source services to a F2AST contractor or large business subcontractor.  In addition, services that are not reasonably severable from the development, modification or depot maintenance efforts may be included.  No requirement that has been previously performed by any small business or is suitable for a small business shall be issued under F2AST.  Small business categories include: small businesses, small disadvantage businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, women owned small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and HUB Zone small businesses.

F2AST does not include Military Construction (MILCON), Civil Engineering, Base Operating Support (BOS) or Commercial Items. In addition, F2AST will not be used for new development programs.

The program/contract is estimated at $5.4 billion for a period of seven (7) years consisting of a three year basic contract period and two, two-year option periods. Additional information regarding this program can be found at the following website:       https://pkec.robins.af.mil/FAST2/FAST2.htm#Brf.     

The anticipated contract type will be a Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract containing Time and Materials, Fixed Price/Labor Hour, and Cost Reimbursement No Fee line items.  The Request For Proposal is being released on 23 JAN 2008 and closes on or about 22 FEB 2008.           Proposals received will be evaluated using the Technically Acceptable-Performance/Price Tradeoff source selection technique. Only written or faxed responses received directly from the requestor are acceptable. No telephone requests. See Numbered Notes: 26

<DESC>The purpose of this pre-solicitation notice is to update the previously released announcement regarding The Navstar Global Positioning Wing (GPSW), Space and Missile Systems Center's (SMC) planned activities for the progressive competition and down-selection for the acquisition and production (Phases B/C and D) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) Modernized Space Receiver (MSR).  GPS MSR is a phased acquisition; Phase A included trade studies, refinement of the Technical Requirements Documents and the Protection Profile.  Phase A period of performance was from 28 September 2006 through completion of the System Design Review.  The requirements of Phase B/C include the development and delivery of Developmental Flight Units (DFUs) that are flight worthy and Engineering Developmental Units (EDUs) for early testing in the laboratory.  Specific quantities required for each type of hardware shall be specified in the upcoming Call for Improvements (CFI) RFP to be released in September 2007.  The period of performance for Phase B/C is 36 months after contract award.  Phase D includes annual production options with the Government's minimum requirements of two MSR units each year.  The period of performance for Phase D is 2010 through 2020.  Throughout Phases B/C and D, the Government may also procure Developmental Flight Units (DFU) Support, Production Flight Unit (PFU) Support, as well as Special Studies and Classified Special Studies as necessary for the MSR Program. 
RFP FA8807-05-R-0001 resulted in contract awards to General Dynamics C4 Systems, Inc. and ITT Industries Space Systems, LLC for Phase A activities.  The CFI RFP will include complete proposal preparation instructions and proposal evaluation criteria.  To be competitive, potential offerors for Phases B/C and D that were not Phase A incumbents must be able to clearly demonstrate their capability to perform Phases B/C and D work and proposed system maturity necessary to successfully perform the said  Phases.  To meet the requirements of the CFI RFP, potential offerors who are not currently performing Phase A contracts will be required to include in their proposals the same contractual documents required by RFP FA8807-05-R-0001 and RFP Amendments 0001-0006.  Specific information and instructions with respect to these documents is contained in RFP FA8807-05-R-0001 and its Amendments thereto.   These and other GPS program documents are available to all potential offerors in the MSR Bidder's Library.   To gain access to the MSR Bidder's Library contact Capt Joel Rivera at (310) 653-3535 or by e-mail at joel.rivera@losangeles.af.mil.  In addition to establishing a Bidder's Library account, potential offerors desiring to access MSR documentation from the Bidder's Library must have the following Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) components: (a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or (b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html).  Any questions in regards to obtaining a CAC or ECA, should be directed Mr. John Pezan at (310) 653-3208 or by email at john.pezan@losangeles.af.mil.  The approximate timeframe for processing a CAC or ECA is eight (8) weeks.  The process time for access to the MSR Bidder's Library website is approximately one (1) week for offerors currently possessing a CAC or ECA.  
In order to demonstrate an offeror's technical capability and system maturity, competitors (including those not currently performing on MSR Phase A contracts) will be required to perform a System Design Review (SDR) demonstration as was identified in RFP FA8807-05-R-0001, Part IV, Attachment 1 to Section L, "MSR Program Statement of Objectives", subparagraph "MSR Contract Objectives Phase A", and RFP Amendment 0005.  Amendment 0005 provides a description of the System Design Review for the MSR program.  As called out in Amendment 0005, the MSR demonstration (SDR) will be a review to ensure that the offeror's proposed MSR can proceed into preliminary design and that all system requirements and functional performance requirements reflected in the Technical Requirements Document (TRD)/Protection Profile (PP), as updated through the results of the trade analysis conducted during Phase A by the Requirements Technical Interchange Working Group (RTIWG), are defined.  Further, the demonstration will ensure that those system and functional performance requirements are consistent with program budget, schedule, risk and other system constraints.  The demonstration will determine whether the MSR functional definition is decomposed to a level sufficient to begin preliminary design.  Completion of the demonstration shall provide:
1. An established system functional baseline;
2. A MSR risk assessment;
3. A System/Subsystem Description Document (SSDD), and; 
4. A program development schedule including hardware and software critical path drivers.
5. Results of Phase A CAIV (Cost as an Independent Variable) trade studies
A successful demonstration (SDR) shall be predicated upon the Government's determination that the MSR performance requirements and plans for design and development form a satisfactory basis for proceeding into preliminary design.
The Government will work with offerors not participating in Phase A to schedule the SDR during the discussion phase of source selection.  
As stated in Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award (page 1), RFP FA8807-05-R-0001, and Section H - Special Contract Requirements (SCR), SMC - H014 of the resulting contracts, the criteria for the Government's selection of the best overall offer will include best value assessment of the CFI proposal, innovation and cost justification demonstrated in Trade Studies, successful completion of design review with a robust, compliant, and low risk design for development and production, successful compliance with all contract requirements, responses to the Engineering Process Questionnaire (EPQ), responsive and effective management, and technical competence.  The Government reserves the right to change these evaluation criteria at any time.  Specific evaluation criteria will be provided in the Government's CFI RFP.  
Information associated with the MSR Program may be classified up to SECRET.  Offerors and their teammates interested in competing will be required to have a minimum of SECRET facility clearance and personnel cleared to the SECRET level prior to award of the resultant contract.  Only offers submitted by U.S.-owned companies performing within the continental United States or its territories will be considered for award.   
This pre-solicitation notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered a request to submit proposal or otherwise be considered as a commitment by the Government.  To aid in planning and scheduling events with respect to the competition, request offerors (other than those currently performing Phase A contracts) interested in competing, provide the Government with a Statement of Interest and Capability (SIC).  The SIC should describe the prospective offeror's team, each team member role in the MSR program, capabilities of each member of the team, experience of each team member in performing efforts each team member will be proposed to provide.  At a minimum, the SIC should cover (1) military GPS receiver development, (2) space-qualified GPS receiver development, and (3) GPS M-code.  SICs shall be no more than ten pages and shall be submitted to GPSW/GPK (ATTN: Ms. Debbie D. Tatum, 483 N. Aviation Boulevard, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808 or via email to debbie.tatum@losangeles.af.mil).  Responses to this notice must be received not later than 45 calendar days after publication in FedBizOps.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

DESCRIPTION

A sole source increase of the maximum amount of contract FA8651-04-D-0427 is contemplated with Boeing Company ? St. Louis (Boeing), P.O. Box 516, St. Louis, MO 63166-3455.  Boeing is the only qualified source to conduct this effort.  Contract FA8651-04-D-0427 for the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) Research & Development Program was awarded to Boeing on 1 Nov 2004.   This is an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with one CPFF CLIN for which task orders are issued.  The Statement of Work included three potential tasks 1) initial concept refinement, 2) weapon development and preliminary testing, and 3) weapon performance demonstration.  The period of performance of the contract is 60 months.  Task 1 for the concept refinement was completed 28 Apr 2005.  Task 2 is for weapon development and preliminary testing and is in the process of being completed.  Task Order 3 for weapon performance demonstration was awarded on 30 Aug 2006.  Task Order 3  requires the contractor to fabricate up to 5 test articles and integrate the units to be flight tested.  This will include performance and support of flight testing of the hardware in accordance with the government-approved Master Test Plan.  Performance testing will include MOP Ejection Pit Drop Tests, Flight Test demonstrations, Penetration against Hard and Deeply Buried Targets and Blast Lethality tests.  The contractor will also complete the design and fabrication of B-52 MOP carriage and release system, conduct final program review and provide a final report.  This large penetrating weapon is being designed for the defeat of hard and deeply buried targets.  A risk reduction effort of up to 5 flight and penetration tests must be pursued in Task Order 3 to support a possible acquisition program decision in FY2008.  Boeing is the only company that can accomplish the Task Order 3 work effort while maintaining the MOP program schedule.  The Government intends to bilaterally modify contract FA8651-04-D-0427 to increase the maximum contract amount, and to continue work effort under Task Order 3 for weapon performance demonstration with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command is in the process of preparing a draft Request for Proposal (RFP) intended for release on or around 3 December 2007 for a Common Mobile Aircrew Restraint System (CMARS) and this draft RFP will be open to the industry for comment until 17 December 2007. A final RFP is anticipated for release on 11 February 2008 with proposals due into NAVAIR by 28 March 2008. To recapture some of the information provided in the previous RFI issued in March 2007 for the CMARS, the Navy is looking for either developmental or commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technologies that can provide improvements to Mobile Aircrew Restraint Systems for Crash & Fall protection. Candidate platforms include both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft that include mobile crewmembers. Systems are desired that have application to large cabin aircraft to provide continuous restraint while preventing mobile occupants from being ejected during a crash or from falling through large openings, doors, ramps, etc. While COTS equipment is of particular interest, all candidate technologies that may meet Mobile Aircrew Restraint requirements are sought. This is not a request for information or a request for proposal, rather a synopsis to aid in the preparation of submissions for the anticipated draft and final RFPs. All inquires must be sent to  David Borne, Code AIR-2.4.2.2.3, Naval Air Systems Command, Building 2272, Room 353, 47123 Buse Road, Patuxent river, MD 20671-1547.

A flood event in October 2006 washed out the existing irrigation dam in the Fremont River leaving the water users without means of diverting water to approximately 800 acres of irrigated fields.  The people of Hanksville had no irrigation water last year.  If they don't have water this year, they will go out of business.  

The items of work required include the construction of a new concrete diversion dam in the corridor of the Fremont River approximately 2 miles upstream of the community of Hanksville.  Additional components of the diversion structure and delivery system include a rock raceway for fish passage at the diversion structure, a concrete sediment sluicing structure, approximately 9,000 linear feet of 30 inch HDPE irrigation pipeline, and a new concrete water control structure at the downstream end of the pipeline for delivering water to the existing irrigation ditches.  The water control structure will also incorporate a suspended pipe bridge over the river providing water to a portion of the irrigated farmland opposite the water control structure.

As the diversion structure is in the river itself and portions of the irrigation pipeline are at the edge of the active river corridor, rock armament totaling about 31,000 cubic yards to protect the new structures will be required in order to sustain the life span of the proposed engineering practices.

As significantly lesser portion of this acquisition is to restore the Caineville Diversion, approximately 15.20 miles further upstream.

Program evaluation methodologies, total quality management practices, and managed care prototypes are made possible through careful use of this data. The contract will allow the use of the Uniform Data System's Functional Independence Measure (FIM) instrument assessment tool, which allows the VA facilities to be "credentialed" in the FIM data collection process.

Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Notice:
This requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.  No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of information.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.
Background:
The Department of the Air Force has developed an Energy Strategic Plan that extends well beyond meeting the goals of both Executive Order 13423 and the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  The Air Force?s Vision is for energy to be a consideration in all aspects of its mission.  An important extension of the Energy Strategic Plan is expanding and diversifying the energy production and supplies portfolio.  Members of Congress have requested that the Air Force consider the merits of nuclear power production at some of its installations in order to mitigate the impact of decreased availability and rising costs of any one energy source, and because production of nuclear power produces no emissions of greenhouse gasses. 
 
Expression of Interest Desired:
The Department of the Air Force requests an expression of interest from prospective entities (developers, contractors, teams, consortiums, joint ventures, etc.) that are capable of developing, designing, providing, owning and operating a nuclear power plant that produces electricity at any possible Air Force installation across the United States.  Numerous scenarios are possible, but the Air Force anticipates under a public-private partnership that in exchange for a long-term lease of federally owned land for the nuclear power plant, it could receive reliable power for Air Force and possibly other DoD missions under a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).  Other considerations would include selling excess power to the electric grid, selling/providing steam to local communities, or being a source of high temperature steam for industrial processes such as synthetic fuels and petrochemical plants. The Department of the Air Force expects all expressions of interest to be commercially funded and financially viable ventures with normal commercial risk.  In all cases, the Department of the Air Force would not develop, design, own, operate, or be the licensee for the nuclear power plant.
In addition to understanding industry interest, the Department of the Air Force is keenly interested in gaining an appreciation of the risks and challenges both the private entity as well as the Air Force may face in bringing a nuclear power plant to fruition on leased Air Force land.  No particular Air Force installation is envisioned in this Request for Information.

Submission Requirements:
Please include in your response to this Request for Information, the scenario or scenarios that would most interest your entity under a public/private partnership, and how the scenario(s) might be envisioned to operate in terms of finance, security, power guarantees, cost per KWH under a PPA, and acreages (including setback) needed.  It would be helpful to have a description of the nuclear power plant envisioned (designer, provider, source, plant life-cycle, its output, and its waste stream) and where this plant (or package plant) may have been put into operation, domestically or internationally.  Also describe as clearly and concisely as possible the issues, concerns, and challenges facing your entity as you see it, in bringing a nuclear power plant to fruition; and identify that which you believe you need in the way of commitments, guarantees, etc., or require from the Department of the Air Force to provide, own and operate a nuclear power plant on any Air Force installation in the United States.  Also of interest would be an estimate of the cost and an assessment of the time to put such a plant in place.  Although not required, if you have one or more Air Force installations in mind as you respond to this Request for Information, please identify them.  It would be helpful to also note in your response why you used this installation in developing your response.
 
Handling and Processing:
All responses received will be considered.  Under this Request for Information or under future issuances, the Department of the Air Force may continue to pursue this topic leading to the signing of a Letter of Intent with a single entity.  At our discretion, the Department of the Air Force may use competition to pursue any leases, agreements, etc., that may be issued in pursuit of the Air Force energy goals.  The Department of the Air Force expects to use consultants to assist it with its review of all responses received.  All responses received maybe held for an extended period of time or destroyed.  In no case will any responses received be returned to the originator.
Other ? Nuclear Power Session at USAF Energy Forum II
The Department of the Air Force will hold an extended session on nuclear power in conjunction with the USAF Energy Forum II on March 3, 2008 to discuss this initiative.  More information on the USAF Energy Forum II will be posted and link a will be provide on the USAF website.

General Due Date:
Responses to this Notice are preferred via regular mail with an additional copy by email and should be received not later than 11 Feb 08.

<DESC>NOTICE: SOLICITATION DOD STTR 2008 DESIGNATION HAS BEEN CHANGED TO DOD STTR 2008.A.

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DoD) SMALL BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER (STTR) PROGRAM 2008.  Small high-technology firms and research institutions are encouraged to jointly submit proposals to DoD for high quality cooperative research and development to solve the defense-related scientific or engineering problems set forth in the solicitation, especially those concepts that also have high potential for commercialization in the private sector.  STTR solicitation 2008 will be publicly released on the DoD SBIR/STTR Web Site (http://www.acq.osd.mil/sadbu/sbir) on January 22, 2008.   The 2008 STTR Solicitation will open for receipt of proposals on February 19, 2008 and will close at 6:00 AM EST, March 19, 2008.  NOTE:  Proposals received after the specified due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).  Submissions must include the proposal cover sheets, technical proposal, Company Commercialization Report, and cost proposal to be considered a complete proposal.  Five DoD components will participate in the 2008 solicitation - the Department of the Army; the Department of the Navy; the Department of the Air Force; the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  The solicitation lists all the R&D topics under which DoD is seeking proposals, and also contains detailed information on the parameters of the STTR program and how to submit a proposal.  Small firms and research institutions apply first for a phase I award of not to exceed $100,000 and one year, to test the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of a particular concept.  If phase I proves successful, the firm may be invited to apply for a phase II award not to exceed $750,000 for up to 24 months, to further develop the concept.  Proposals must be submitted via the DOD SBIR/STTR website at http://www.dodsbir.net/submission following the instructions contained in the solicitation, including the instructions specified in the solicitation for the DoD component to which you are applying.  Offerors bear the risk of website inaccessibility due to heavy usage in the final hours before the solicitation closing time, so plan ahead and submit early.  The complete solicitation may be accessed at http://www.dodsbir.net/solicitation.  Participation in the DoD STTR Program is restricted to small business firms organized for profit with 500 or fewer employees, including all affiliated firms.  Questions may be directed to the SBIR/STTR Help Desk at (866) 724-7457 or Mr. Michael Caccuitto at (703) 588-8610, or by e-mail: michael.caccuitto@osd.mil or Ms. Amy Smith, Contracting Officer at (937) 255-0493, e-mail amy.smith@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice only, with specific interest in small business capability.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from qualified small businesses and to conduct market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 (please see attached market research questions).  No solicitation is being issued at this time.  This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.  The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB), Colorado, seeks potential sources to perform a variety of non-personal Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) and Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) services in support of Headquarters, Air Force Space Command (HQ AFSPC), PAFB, Colorado.  A broad range of technical and analytical advisory and assistance and systems engineering and technical assistance shall be provided under this contract to include support or improvement of policy development, management, administration and improvement of systems operations.  This requirement shall also consist of several phases of planning, programming, acquisition, and implementation cycles of various Government systems to complement the Government?s technical expertise in accomplishing its mission.  In rendering the foregoing services, outputs may take the form of information, advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, and training services.  Work under this contract will require security clearances.  For reference purposes, the solicitation, when issued, will be numbered FA2517-08-R-9000 and will be a Request for Proposal (RFP).  A best value source selection will likely be the method of contractor selection.  Work performed under the current HQ AFSPC contract will be accessible at the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS) website.  It is anticipated the contract performance period will be a base period of five years with no option periods, and the program?s ceiling value will be approximately $400 million. Most of the work is expected to be performed on PAFB.  The Government is contemplating award of a multiple award Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with firm fixed price and cost type contract line item numbers (CLINs).  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences, with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. No decision has yet been made regarding the small business strategy for this contract.  However, in anticipation of addressing bundling issues, the Government is specifically assessing the availability and potential of small business to perform this work.  Small business is advised that FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, would apply wherein at least 50 percent of the work must be performed by the small business prime contractor alone.  Small businesses wishing to influence the Contracting Officer?s decision regarding small business set-asides are urged to respond to this announcement via e-mail to jamie.dufrene@peterson.af.mil with a courtesy copy to jeane.steed@peterson.af.mil.  Please provide your Central Contractor Registration (CCR) number; a brief description of your company?s business size and status (i.e., HUBZone, woman/veteran/service disabled veteran/native American/minority-owned); and a point of contact (POC) name, telephone number and e-mail address.  Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this notice or any follow-up information requests is voluntary and shall be treated as confidential.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with this or future requests.  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as amendments to this announcement.  All amendments will be available for viewing at this website, FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.eps.gov.  It is incumbent upon the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents. All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with FAR  52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration, lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.  Additionally, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 52.204-8, Annual Representations and Certifications, offerors are also reminded to register with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov .   Please provide responses by 22 January 2008.  Any questions may be addressed via e-mail to jeane.steed@peterson.af.mil. 

PLEASE NOTE:  MARKET RESEARCH QUESTIONS ARE NOT JUST FOR SMALL BUSINESS.  WE WOULD APPRECIATE RESPONSES FROM LARGE BUSINESS AS WELL ON THE MARKET RESEARCH QUESTIONS.

<DESC>Message Transformation Tool Request For Information - Details 1.	Description THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) 2.	Vendor Requirements Vendors shall provide detailed information about the features of their message transformation tools.  If shortlisted, then the vendor is responsible for providing a demonstration of the tool. Vendors shall also provide information about how their tool will fit in with the existing Veteran Health Information Technology (VHIT) architecture. 3.	Introduction Software Engineering and Integration (SE&I) is seeking a vendor for a commercial off the shelf (COTS) tool to provide message transformation of Health Level Seven (HL7) version 2.x messages from ER7 (delimited encoding) encoding to HL7 XML encoding and transformation of HL7 version 2.x messages from HL7 XML encoding to ER7 (delimited encoding). 4.	Size of Organization As of December 30, 2004 , 157 medical centers and 869 ambulatory care and community based outpatient clinics. VA supports approximately 300 clinical laboratories. The demographic information pertaining to the size and function of these laboratories needs to be defined in order to develop the business model and determine the deployment strategy of the Laboratory System Re-engineering product. VA employs over 220,000 personnel with approximately 7,000 laboratory employees. 5.	Details  The message transformation tool should perform the following requirements are described below.  Requirements	Business Rationale The transformation tool shall support the transformation of messages that conform to the Health Level Seven (HL7) Standard.	The Health Level Seven (HL7) Standard is one of the protocols supported by the messaging system. The transformation tool shall support the transformation of messages that conform to the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) Standard.	The National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) Standard is one of the protocols supported by the messaging system. The transformation tool shall support the transformation of messages that conform to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard.	The ASTM Standard is one of the protocols supported by the messaging system. The transformation tool shall support the transformation of messages that conform to the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Standard.	The DICOM Standard is one of the protocols supported by the messaging system. The transformation tool shall support the transformation of messages that conform to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Standard (the EDI X12 Standard).	The EDI X12 Standard is one of the protocols supported by the messaging system. The transformation tool shall support the transformation of messages that conform to the Health Level Seven (HL7) Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) Standard.	The HL7 CDA Standard is one of the protocols supported by the messaging system. The transformation tool shall transform fragmented messages.	A single logical message to be physically split across multiple messages for transmission.  The transformation tool must be able to provide perform transformations on messages that have been fragmented, which will probably involve assembling the single message from fragments, performing the transformation, and refragmenting the message for transport to the destination application.. The transformation tool shall transform batch messages.	Some applications produce batch messages that may require transformation prior to delivery to a target application. The transformation tool shall perform datatype transformations when the datatype of an element in a message type to be transformed is different than the datatype required by the target message type.	The datatype of an element may be different when the element is contained in different message types or message versions.  The change in datatype of an element between the source message and target message must be accounted for in a transformation. The transformation tool shall perform logic-driven data manipulations (e.g., transformation of non-coded values to coded values, transformation between different coded value sets).	Logic driven transformations are required to perform sophisticated transformations that are more elaborate than simple mapping of data between different formats. The transformation tool shall support the character delimiters contained in HL7 message headers (to include MSH, BHS, and FHS segments) in accordance with the HL7 standard.	Support for HL7 character delimiters is necessary in order to correctly transform HL7 messages. The transformation tool shall support the specified character set and the alternate character set handling scheme specified in the HL7 Standard.	Support for HL7 character sets is necessary in order to correctly transform HL7 messages. The transformation tool shall transform HL7 messages between different 2.x versions of the HL7 Standards.	Since different applications use different 2.x versions of the HL7 Standard, the transformation tool must provide transformation services so that applications using different 2.x versions of HL7 can communicate with each other. The transformation tool shall transform HL7 version 2.x messages from ER7 (delimited encoding) encoding to HL7 XML encoding.	Because some applications use ER7 encoding and DoD and some applications use the HL7 XML encoding, the transformation tool must provide transformation services so that applications and systems can communicate with one another. The transformation tool shall transform HL7 version 2.x messages from HL7 XML encoding to ER7 (delimited encoding).	Because some applications and DoD use the HL7 XML encoding and some applications use ER7 encoding, the transformation tool must provide transformation services so that applications and systems can communicate with one another. The transformation tool shall support transformations that constrain and localize the HL7 Standard for a specific implementation.	Constraints and localizations are used to extend HL7 message structures within the message production rules of the HL7 Standard (i.e., to define Z-segments).  That is, the transformation tool must support implementation-specific (e.g., at different sites) transformations. The transformation tool shall import HL7 conformance profiles for use in validating and transforming HL7 messages.	Conformance to a HL7 profile guarantees interoperability between applications exchanging HL7 messages. The transformation tool shall recognize the conformance statement id and apply the conformance statement id in the validation of HL7 message headers (to include MSH, BHS, and FHS segments.)	Use of the conformance statement id ensures that the transformation tool uses the correct conformance profile in the validation of a HL7 message prior to an after performing a transformation on the message. The transformation tool shall validate that each message it receives is well-formed and compliant with the minimal requirements of the standard applicable to the type of message.	Validation of the structure of messages for well-formedness provides an indication of invalid messages that will not be able to be transformed correctly.  The transformation tool shall provide validation for messages in all of the protocols specified in the transformation tool requirements. The transformation tool shall validate a message to be transformed against a message profile prior to transforming the message and validate the message output from a transformation against a message profile after transforming the message.	Validation against a message profile ensures that a message has all the attributes required to be transformed and that the message was properly transformed. The transformation tool shall generate an error for each message that fails validation against a message profile prior to being input to a transformation or after output from a transformation.	Failure to validate is an error.  The system in which the error occurred must generate an error for use by the messaging system to be handled in accordance with all of the error-handling requirements defined in the messaging system specification. The transformation tool shall be capable of interfacing with the transformation and content-enrichment service interfaces exposed by the messaging system.	The transformation tool must interface with the messaging system in order to receive messages that require transformation and to deliver transformed messages to their destinations. The transformation tool shall run on a minimum of the Microsoft and Redhat Linux operating systems.	The VA possesses hardware that runs Microsoft and Linux operating systems. The transformation tool shall run on a SUN solaris 10 platform.	VBIT has a requirement to support the SUN solaris 10 platform. The transformation tool shall provide a graphical user interface to design the information mapping and transformations specified. Ideally the tool should be based on the Eclipse framework. 	Eclipse is the VA's IDE.  Application developers need an interface, which is integrated into the Eclipse IDE that allows them to define transformations. The transformation tool shall provide user interfaces that are compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.	Compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act is a regulatory requirement. The transformation tool shall provide the capability to compress messages prior to sending the messages.	The ability to compress messages is needed as a form of risk mitigation to handle future bandwidth problems. The transformation tool shall provide the capability to decompress compressed messages before delivering the messages to a receiving application.	The ability to decompress compressed messages is a complementary requirement to the requirement to provide the capability to compress messages. The transformation tool shall provide a configurable message compression/decompression capability.	The ability to configure the message compression/decompression capability is required to enable optimization of the use of message compression and decompression.  Compression/decompression configuration also provides the capability to turn message compression and decompression on and off as appropriate. The transformation tool shall transform 100 HL7 messages between ER7 version 2.x and XML formats per second.	A rate for performance of message transformations is required to ensure that message transformations do not bog down messaging system performance.  Bi-directional transformation is required - "between" includes both transformation from ER7 version 2.x to XML and from XML to ER7 version 2.x. The transformation tool shall provide a reliability that enables the messaging system to provide 99.9 percent successful delivery of messages on the first try.	A rate for successful delivery of messages is required to minimize the amount of error handling, and associated troubleshooting, required to operate the messaging system.  The transformation tool reliability that supports a 99.9 percent reliability for the entire messaging system needs to be determined by a reliability expert. The transformation tool shall support failover to a backup component in support of the recovery of the failure of a component.	The transformation tool must be able to adapt to failovers that the messaging system performs in order to continue operating in the event of hardware failures. The transformation tool shall provide documents for the planning, implementation, configuration, management, operation, and support of the messaging solution and its components.  The system documents should also include accessible electronic documentation (which can be "standard" vendor offerings) for trouble-shooting and support and training materials for the management and operation of the solution components.	These shall serve as input for a VA-specific system management guide, system operations guide, system configuration, system inventory, implementation plan, and migration plan.  The documentation is required for VA to efficiently and effectively apply internal personnel resources toward the initial and continued implementation, configuration, operation, and support of the included systems. The transformation tool shall include vendor commitment to support deployed products and versions for a length of time advantageous to the Department.  The acceptable amount of support time is a minimum of three years after purchase of any and all major components in the solution, pending purchase of option years of support.	The transformation tool must have long-term value in terms of maintained supportability. The transformation tools shall support value set mapping (e.g. from local value sets to the standard value sets).	Coded clinical and administrative concepts are often using local ad-hoc code sets. To ensure interoperability, these local codes must be mapped to code sets based on  The transformation tools must be able to load message structure definitions encoded in XML using HL7 Message Profile schema The specification that describes the segments, fields, components, and subcomponents implemented in a specific  The transformation tools must be able to transform HL7 ASCII encoded (ER7) messages to any XML format and to transform XML-encoded payloads to HL7 ER7. 	HL7 V2 messages are the way legacy systems exchange information with new systems that rely on CDA documents. XML-encoded HL7 Version 3 messages, or VHIM messages.  Generalized Versioning Requirement Transformation tool must be configurable in order to manage multiple active versions of input and output domain messages and their respective transformations. The transformation tool shall include a user interface for importing mapping files. Tool shall have import facilities for mapping. 	VHIM, HL7, and other internal message structures will have multiple active versions being sent inside the VHA.  In order to support the transformation, the tool must be configurable and flexible enough to identify messages version during runtime and select appropriate transformation based on message version. HL7 to VHIM mapping files are complex, vetted and ensured to be accurate.  Rework of this mapping effort would be duplication of effort. Generalized Mapping Import requirement Transformation proprietary mapping language must be text based to support potential code generation solutions and automation to overall mapping development. Current transformations required are HL7 ER7 2.4 and 2.5 TO/FROM VHIM 4.x.  The transformation tool should support released versions of HL7 and VHIM. Proprietary, if the tool can handle multiple version of XML schema. Multiple versions of inputs and multiple versions of outputs. 	VHA will have numerous messages defined along with transformations.  In order to control the complexity and resource intensive activity of maintaining mapping logic, code generation and other potential automation solutions will be explored.  The transformation tool will need to accept generated text as input to transformation runtime processing. The are more versions of HL7 that have been approved but not used in the VA.  External data such as commercial off-the-shelf (COTs) products like lab may use HL7 v2.3 DoD may be upgrading to HL7 version 2.5.1.  VHIM is planning on scheduled releases of VHIM.  CDS plans to support multiple VHIM versions are they are released. The message transformation tool should be able to perform the transformation based on the runtime information.	Versions or format of the target message may be arbitrarily depended on the client that receives the transformed message and so needs to be specified at runtime.  The transformation tool should be able to split and reconstruct a message that can contain a single or multiple messages. e.g. A large message may need to be split into multiple pieces depending on the recipients.   It may also need to reconstruct multiple messages prior to transforming the payload TO/FROM HL7 and VHIM.  	CHDR sends CDS a query that yields a large result set that spans domains (e.g. the complete medical record for a patient), CDS returns one large VHIM template (the result of the query) that spans domains, this VHIM template needs to be transformed into separate HL7 messages for each supported domain and wrapped into a batch response and returned to CHDR. Perform The transformation tools shall support message sizes of 40 MB  	XML and VHIM messages are 10 fold the size the HL7 ER7 messages.  Perform The transformation tools shall take 30 milliseconds or less per transformation, with a transaction volume of 1000 per second for message size of 2.5 KB, with a maximum size of 500 KB for a single message.  These are in a "flat file" format (HL7 ER7). Need to confirm from VHIM about XML message size.  BHIE and Cheddar 	These are CDS performance requirements.  Support of VistA 1.0 and the HDR project should expect high volume of messages and transformations. The transformation tool should be capable of participating in a distributed transaction.  	A transaction is a mechanism to ensure that transformation have occurred and sent or received by an application.   The transformation tool should be deployable in a Continuation Of operations framework. Application to be able to participate in a 5-9 environment.  The tool shall be available 24/7/365.5. 5-9	All SOA are required to have a COOP strategy. The Transformation shall return the status of a transformation with sufficient (recovery potential information) detail. 	The error detail in asynchronous message must be sufficient to allow correlation with the original message. The TS tool's integration requirements shall facilitate keeping the TS tool's performance independent from the messaging system's performance.	This is to avoid TS tool performance loads or problems from critically impacting the remainder of the messaging system.  For example, if the TS tool fails, it should not bring down the rest of the messaging system.   The transformation process must support inbound HL7 2.x/ER7 encoded messages/content.	VHA Enterprise Applications will continue to create HL7 2.x messages and the tool must support the message structure natively. The transformation process must support outbound HL7 2.x/ER7 encoded messages/content.	VHA Enterprise will continue to have clients expecting HL7 2.x messages and the tool must support the message structure natively. The transformation process must support inbound XML messages/content 	The format of VHA Enterprise messages of the future will be XML.  The tool will need to support the xml message structure natively The transformation process must support outbound XML messages/content	The format of VHA Enterprise messages of the future will be XML.  The tool will need to support the xml message structure natively The transformation tool's proprietary transformation/mapping language must support complex  programmatic logic to support HL7 2.x transformation	HL7 2.x message structure typically contains complex recurring data structures.  In order to process these structure effectively - programmatic features such as loops and recursion will need to be supported. NICE TO HAVE Requirements: The tool must be able to persist the contents of XML-encoded message content to a relational database management system	  The tools must be able to create XML-encoded messages from the contents of a relational database management system	 The tool must be able to persist the contents of HL7-encoded message content to a relational database management system	This is a nice-to-have feature to enable HL7 interface implementation. This is a transitional capability for the VA enterprise. The tools must be able to create HL7-encoded messages from the contents of a relations database management system	This is a nice-to-have feature to enable HL7 interface implementation. This is a transitional capability for the VA enterprise.

<SOLNBR>DE-RP52-08NA28487-2
<RESPDATE>021308
<ARCHDATE>08132008
<CONTACT>Kim Gallegos, Contracting Officer, 505-845-5848, kgallegos@doeal.gov;Kim Gallegos, Contract Specialist, 505-845-5848,  kgallegos@doeal.gov
<DESC>PURPOSE OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) This is the second RFI issued by NNSA to support its efforts to develop  and implement a contracting strategy  that will promote more effective and  efficient technical and business operations in support of a more  responsive and cost effective Nuclear Weapons Complex (NWC).  The purpose  of this second RFI is to begin focusing the exchange of information on  potential contracting strategies, options and provisions that will achieve  NNSA objectives while promoting vigorous full and open competition for new  contracts through elimination of barriers to competition.  NNSA is  soliciting information from industry and other interested parties,  including other Federal agencies with similar contracting objectives,  through written comments and one-on-one meetings.  The NNSA Service Center  has established a website at www.doeal.gov/mocontracts/ for the  dissemination of information related to this initiative.  This website is  the principal distribution medium for the exchange of written information  among all interested parties.  We are currently planning to hold  one-on-one meetings in late February/early March 2008, face-to-face at a  location to be determined later and announced on the website.  The  one-on-one meetings are intended to allow candid and uninhibited  disclosure of information consistent with FAR 15.201(a).  Requests for  one-on-one meetings should be submitted to Ms. Kim Gallegos, Contracting  Officer, via e-mail at kgallegos@doeal.gov no later than 5:00 p.m. MST,  February 13, 2008.  Written comments should be submitted to Ms. Gallegos  no later than 5:00 p.m. MST, February 20, 2008, and they may be submitted  in lieu of a one-on-one meeting or in addition to a one-on-one meeting. If  requested, and as normal practice, communication between NNSA and a  respondent regarding this RFI will be treated as business proprietary and  will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law.

<DESC>The United States Department of the Navy (DoN) employs the competitive sourcing process as prescribed by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities (effective May 29, 2003) as a workforce shaping tool to acquire commercial functions at the maximum value, align military functions to war-fighting capabilities, and achieve operational savings for the fleet.  The DoN is considering conducting a follow-on competitive sourcing competition for the services provided by the Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Personal Property Support Offices (PPSO).  

Purpose

As part of the preliminary planning process, your firm is invited to participate in a survey to determine commercial interest in bidding to provide personal property support services.  This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort designed to: 

Obtain expressions of interest from potential service providers to participate in a follow-on competition for the services provided by NAVSUP PPSOs;

Determine the technical and financial capability of potential service providers interested in bidding at the prime contractor level; and

Solicit input on specific topics from potential service providers for consideration during the preliminary planning and development of a solicitation under OMB Circular A-76.

Background

NAVSUP PPSOs provide personal property support services to ensure personal property and Household Goods are moved, stored, and handled in a proper and timely manner.  While PPSOs are responsible for ensuring personal property moves are properly scheduled and coordinated in a timely manner they do not provide actual transportation services for personal property.  In general, the services provided include:

Counseling Services:  Counseling eligible military and civilian personnel on shipping entitlements to ensure customers are properly briefed on personal property shipment options and all information is obtained to process shipments in a timely manner;

Outbound Shipment Processing:  Managing the outbound shipment of personal property (i.e., local, national, and international) and coordinating with carriers, carriers agents and contractors to moves are properly coordinated in a timely manner;

Storage Coordination:  Scheduling and directing Non-Temporary Storage (NTS) and Storage-In-Transit (SIT) to ensure customers long term and short term storage needs are met; 

Inbound Shipment Coordination:  Coordinating inbound shipments to ensure customers are properly notified and delivery is scheduled in a timely manner; and

Quality Assurance:  Inspecting facilities and personal property shipments to support the performance evaluation of carriers, carriers agents and contractors in terms of compliance with their respective contracts and all applicable regulations and directives.

PPSOs are located in Pearl Harbor, HI; Bremerton, WA; San Diego, CA; Norfolk, VA and Jacksonville, FL. With the exception of Pearl Harbor, each location has several field offices that report to the primary office.  The current organization providing services at each location is summarized in the table below, with the FTE count for the PPSOs.  The FTE numbers listed below are the FTE numbers used for the Courtesy Congressional Announcement for this effort.  These numbers should be used as the baseline and may change as the process proceeds due to Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), Joint Basing, transfer of function, workload variations, etc.

A. INTRODUCTION

The OITO currently provides services for a sub-set of the HHS Operating Divisions.  This sub-set, or Consortium, is comprised of approximately 9,000 users in the DC metro area and in the ten (10) Regional Offices throughout the United States, which represents the following organizations: Administration for Children and Families (ACF); Administration on Aging (AOA); Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ); Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) -- Regional Offices only; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA); Office of the Secretary (OS); and Program Support Center (PSC). 

An IT support contract was awarded in October 2005 to provide help desk and desktop services and server and network support to the Consortium through a contractor owned-contractor operated (COCO) task order.  This contract currently provides:

?	Hardware refresh with maintenance and warranties 
?	Software refresh with maintenance
?	Blackberry refresh with maintenance and warranties
?	Network and security hardware 
?	Internet access 
?	Network administration 
?	LAN/WAN connectivity 
?	Shared network printing with optional color capability including toner
?	Web services
?	Terminal services
?	Remote access
?	File and print services
?	Network file sharing  
?	Backup and restore 
?	Training 
?	24 x 7 help desk support
?	Desk Side Support
?	24 x 7 Network and Security Operations

Additionally, the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) located under the Assistant Secretary for Resources and Technology (ASRT)/HHS manages an Enterprise Email System (EES) under a government owned-contractor operated (GOCO) performance based contract, awarded in 2004.  The EES provides email services to the Consortium (9,000 users) and all of the large Operating Divisions, except for the National Institutes for Health (NIH) and the HRSA central office, with a total customer base of about 65,000 users.  

The Government is considering combining these two contracts (IT Support and EES) into one support contract that is COCO and is looking for information and innovative approaches from industry that will enable the Government to seamlessly migrate to a single contract without disrupting its current mission, while enhancing the service offerings for a complete suite of IT services.

In addition to seeking information from all sources, the Government would like to determine if these services can be set-aside for small business.  Small businesses are encouraged to provide their capabilities for these types of support services, whether prime contractor and/or subcontractor, together as one contract or separately (IT Support and EES).  All small businesses (small disadvantaged, woman owned, disabled veteran or veteran owned, 8A and hub zones) are encouraged to submit their interests, relative experience and advice on this RFI.

B. PURPOSE 

The goal of this RFI is to gather industry experience and expert advice on the Government's needs as outlined in the following Scope.  The industry responses will be used by the Government to refine the scope of the future requirement for described services.  In reviewing the responses, the Government may request a meeting or teleconference with responding firms to gain further insight into their capabilities.  The Government will not reimburse costs to any firm for their participation in these meetings or teleconferences.  Firms are encouraged not to include marketing informational material that does not relate to the services described in this RFI as it will be discarded by the reviewers.

<SUBJECT>A--NASA OFFERS PRE-SCREENING OF PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW FRONTIERS OPPORTUNITY
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) plans to release an Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for the third New Frontiers (NF-3) mission no earlier than June 2008. Downselection would occur in 2009. This NF-3 AO will solicit only missions that do not require nuclear sources for power generation or propulsion. In February 2008, NASA plans to release more details about the upcoming NF-3 AO (e.g., cost cap, launch by date, launch vehicle provided, etc.). Once the National Research Council?s (NRC?s) New Opportunities for Solar System Exploration (NOSSE) committee reports to NASA on mid decade NF science mission priorities in March 2008, NASA plans to release more details about allowed targets for the upcoming NF-3 AO. Both of these announcements will be released through both the Federal Business Opportunity website and the SMD email distribution list (register at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/	). In compliance with SMD policy, the Principal Investigators (PI) for a New Frontiers mission must demonstrate minimum experience qualifications that are designed to demonstrate relevant experience exercising responsibility, authority, and management of a space project in the areas of leadership, planning, implementation, and approval. In order to facilitate the creation of teams who plan to respond to the forthcoming NF-3 AO, SMD offers the opportunity of pre-screening the experience qualifications of prospective investigators against the Principal Investigator (PI) minimum experience requirement for large class missions. New Frontiers missions are in the large mission class and have more stringent requirements than medium class or small class missions. Proposed NF-3 investigations that are led by PIs lacking in demonstrated, relevant, and appropriate experience sufficient to meet these requirements will be found noncompliant and will neither be reviewed nor selected. The PI experience requirement for large class missions is met by demonstrating at least two qualifying experiences of at least two years each. One experience must be in a lead role [PI, Project Manager (PM), Project Scientist (PS), Deputy PI, Deputy PM, Deputy PS] for an orbital or deep space mission or instrument that will be launched prior to AO downselection. The second experience must be in a lead or significant support role (e.g., science team lead, operations lead, etc.) for a different space mission. Experience must include the development of flight hardware. Experience gained in pre-proposal and Phase A concept studies does not meet this requirement. Investigators desiring pre-screening against the PI experience requirement for NF-3 may submit a completed copy of the PI Space Flight Experience Table. A copy of the table as well as instructions for completing and submitting it are available at the NF Acquisition Additional Information web page at http://newfrontiers.larc.nasa.gov/	   .  NASA is offering this opportunity as a service to prospective PIs. A request for pre-screening is voluntary and is not required by NASA. However, it is important to realize that proposed NF-3 investigations that are led by PIs lacking in demonstrated, relevant, and appropriate experience sufficient to meet these requirements will be declared noncompliant and will not be reviewed or selected. It is the intent of NASA to also offer the pre-screening opportunity after release of the final NF-3 AO. In response to the request for pre-screening, NASA will inform the investigator that their response is, or is not, sufficient to demonstrate that the PI minimum experience requirements have been met. For submissions that do not adequately demonstrate that the PI minimum experience requirements have been met, NASA will indicate which component of the PI minimum experience requirements has not been demonstrated by the submission. NASA?s response will be through an email to the submitter, which will contain specific comments explaining NASA?s response, and/or requests for clarification. If the table documenting the PI qualifications passes the pre-screening, then this same table will be adequate to comply with the PI minimum experience requirement for the NF-3 AO. In this case the table must be included in the NF-3 proposal. Release of the NF-3 AO is in the process of formally being approved by NASA. However, by offering this service to prospective investigators at this time (prior to release), NASA is under no obligation to issue the AO and solicit proposals. Any costs incurred by prospective investigators in preparing submissions in response to this invitation are incurred completely at the submitter's own risk.  NASA will conduct screenings twice a month from February until March of 2008, inclusive. Submissions received by the first or third Monday of the month will receive a response from NASA within 10 days. NASA will conduct screenings once a month from April until May of 2008, inclusive. Submissions received by the first Monday of the month will receive a response from NASA within three weeks. Additional opportunities will be announced in the NF-3 AO. Questions may be addressed to Dr. Adriana C. Ocampo, NF Program Executive, Science Mission Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC 20546; Tel.: (202) 358-2152; Email: aco@nasa.gov.

<OFFADD>Department of Energy, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (DOE Contractor), Industrial Partnerships & Commercialization, 7000 East Avenue L-795, Livermore, CA, 94550, UNITED STATES
<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Deep Sea Hybrid Power Systems Enabling Technology for Deep Sea Oil & Gas Recovery
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Deep Sea Hybrid Power Systems Enabling Technology for Deep Sea Oil & Gas Recovery Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering to form partnerships with domestic corporate entities interested in deep sea oil and gas production technology.

Background: An investment in sub-sea (deep-ocean) hybrid power systems is required to enable off-shore oil and gas exploration and harvesting. Advanced deep-ocean drilling operations, locally powered, will provide access to oil and gas reserves otherwise inaccessible. Such technology will therefore enhance the energy security of the United States. The oil and gas industry is being pushed beneath the surface by economic concerns. According to The Economist (September 8th ? 14th 2007), there is a ?sea change? in off-shore drilling technology. The article discusses the cost and manpower required to operate a typical oil and gas platform in the middle of the North Sea. There are 435 such platforms in the British waters of the North Sea alone. In regard to costs, the Alwyn North Oil and Gas Platform was built for a cost of ?1.5 billion ($2.4 billion) in the mid 1980?s and has spent nearly half that amount upgrading the platform since its construction. According to Oil and Gas United Kingdom, an industry group, oil firms spent over ?11 billion last year building and running offshore facilities in British waters alone. Such operating costs places production costs for one barrel of oil at $22 per barrel, which is nearly the highest in the world. These costs are rising rapidly. The Deutsche Bank estimates that inflation in the oil business has run at 30% a year over the past two years, and will continue to rise by at least 15% per year through 2008.

Such economics drive the development of sub-sea capabilities on the ocean floor. Such facilities will require ample supplies of local power to operate machinery on the floor, ranging from drills to pumps and compressors. Ultimately safe, efficient and economical submarine tanker fleets could transport fuel, thereby eliminating the need for pipeline construction and transport altogether. Such tankers could rely on natural-gas powered fuel cells, with power system construction analogous to that of the publicized HDW sub-sea vessels.

Description:  LLNL is seeking a partner to develop hybrid energy conversion and storage systems for deep ocean operations. Such power systems will be located on the oceans floor, and will be used to supply oil and gas exploration activities, as well as drilling operations required to harvest petroleum reserves. The objective of the work is to evaluate alternatives and recommend equipment to develop into hybrid energy conversion and storage systems for deep ocean operations. Such power systems will be located on the ocean floor and will be used to power offshore oil and gas exploration and production operations. Energy storage strategies are being considered for further development to enable deep sea oil and gas production. For example, batteries and capacitors can be used to enhance the overall rate capability of a hybrid system, which also includes a fuel cell or other energy engine. Such stored energy is also required for control systems, startup, and to enable the system to tolerate fluctuations in fuel, oxidant and load. The energy storage technologies to be explored may include, but are not limited to: (1) compressed-gas storage; (2) liquid red-ox batteries; (3) secondary batteries in sealed pressure vessels; (4) pressure-tolerant secondary batteries; and (5) Other Non-conventional battery systems, for example, oil-compensated polymer-gel lithium-ion batteries; polyurethane potted polymer-gel lithium-ion batteries; lithium-ion batteries; and lead acid batteries.

Advantages:  
Enable certain off-shore oil and gas exploration and production. Advanced deep-ocean drilling and production operations, locally powered, may 
?	Provide commercial access to oil and gas reserves otherwise inaccessible. 
?	Produce lower carbon emissions from subsea generation of electrical power. 
?	Enhance the energy security of the United States, and  
?	Reduce environmental impact of  oil exploration and production.. 

Potential Applications:  The opportunity involves the development of hybrid energy conversion and storage systems for deep ocean operations. Such power systems will be located on the oceans floor, and will be used to supply oil and gas exploration activities, as well as drilling operations required to harvest petroleum reserves.

Feature	Benefit
Fuel Cell for Primary Energy Conversion	Utilization of Gas from Deep Sea Well Head 
Secondary Electrical Energy Storage System	Enables High Power or Pumps and Motors

Development Status:  Further development is required. Some concepts are in the breadboard stage while other any storage systems are in a lab prototype phase. LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

CONTRACTOR-MISSION RELATIONSHIPS 
 
   (a) The contractor acknowledges that this contract is an important part of the U.S. Foreign Assistance 
Program and agrees that his/her duties will be carried out in such a manner as to be fully commensurate with the responsibilities that this entails.  
   (b) While in the Cooperating Country, the contractor is expected to show respect for the conventions, customs, and institutions of the Cooperating Country and not interfere in its political affairs.
 
   (c) If the contractor's conduct is not in accordance with paragraph (b) of this provision, the contract may be terminated under General Provision 16 of this contract.  The Contractor recognizes the right of the U.S. Ambassador to direct his/her immediate removal from any country when, in the discretion of the Ambassador, the interests of the United States so require.
 
   (d) The Country Director is the chief representative of CDC in the Cooperating Country.  In this capacity, he/she is responsible for the total CDC Program in the Cooperating Country including certain administrative responsibilities set forth in this contract and for advising CDC regarding the performance of the work under the contract and its effect on the U.S. Foreign Assistance Program.  The contractor will be responsible for performing his/her duties in accordance with the statement of duties called for by the contract. However, he/she shall be under the general policy guidance of the Country Director, and shall keep the Country Director or his/her designated representative currently informed of the progress of the work under this contract.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.           It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.           Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.           Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).     Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-08-10172, and the solicitation is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation (RFQ)using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-23.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a size standard of $11.0 to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A firm fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for Plasma Peptide or Protein Identification Services.  BACKGROUND. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Gulf Ecology Division is developing protein biomarker techniques to detect adverse effects in aquatic animals, and applying such biomarkers to screen chemicals for mode of action (MOA) specific effects.  To accomplish this, fish are exposed to a model compound(s) representative of a specific MOA, such as estrogenic activity, and a comparison is made between plasma (or other tissue) protein expression of control fish and treated fish.  Tissue/plasma protein biomarkers of a specific MOA are discovered using either  low resolution surface-enhanced-laser-desorption-ionization mass spectrometry (SELDI) or matrix-assisted-laser-desorption-ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI).  These two types of mass spectrometry provide protein/peptide molecular mass and relative abundance information, but do not necessarily provide protein/peptide identification. OBJECTIVE.  The purpose of this contract is to secure services to provide identification and/or amino acid sequences of peptide/protein biomarker candidates which have been targeted from protein expression profiles generated using a Ciphergen ProteinChip instrument (in either SELDI or MALDI mode). The contractor shall provide all  personnel, facilities, equipment, tools, materials, vehicles, transportation, supervision and services necessary for the identification of target  tissue/plasma peptides/proteins of interest in samples (primarily from fish) supplied by the government. TASK DESCRIPTION. The services to be provided by the contractor are all procedures needed to identify target peptides/proteins in gel, tissue or solution samples provided by the EPA.  Proteins/peptides shall be identified using the best method(s) available such as peptide mass fingerprinting, sequenced using tandem mass spectrometry, De Novo sequencing, or other methods. Sample preparation, data quality control procedures and other services needed for protein identification shall be included. Such services may include total protein quantitation, sample preparation and cleanup (can include concentration, albumin depletion, ultracentrifugation, sonication, dialysis, protein precipitation or other), gel electrophoresis  (may include running, staining, imaging, excising and extracting 1 or 2D gels, or other), gel analysis (may include post-staining, imaging and spot selection, or other), trypsin digestion (may include reduction, alkylation, or other), mass spectrometry and analysis (can include MALDI-MS and MALDI-MS/MS, LC-MS and LC-MS/MS, or other), spectrum, bioinformatics and database searching. A minimum of five (5) and a maximum of fifty (50) peptides or proteins will be provided to the contractor for identification. Tissue/plasma samples provided by EPA to the contractor will be from animal species, predominately fish.  No samples of human origin will be submitted by EPA. The period of performance for this contract shall be from the date of award until 2/28/2009. QUALITY ASSURANCE / QUALITY CONTROL ? Contractor shall have a  QA/QC program in place to assess the quality of the protein identification data. EPA requires that recipients of funds for work involving environmental data comply with the American National Standard ANSI/ASQC E4-1994, "Specifications and Guidelines for Quality Systems for Environmental Data Collection and Environmental Technology Programs." Information concerning quality specifications for non-EPA organizations is available at http://www.epa.gov/quality/exmural.html. The protein identity data in the  final report must meet the QA/QC requirements of the ANSI/ASQC E4 document, and should be suitable for publishing in a peer-reviewed journal. EPA AND CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES. EPA ? The EPA will provide the contractor with plasma/tissue samples which contain the target protein biomarkers for protein  identification.  The EPA will also provide molecular mass information and SELDI-MS and/or MALDI-MS experimental conditions used for the EPA?s low resolution MS analysis of the protein biomarkers supplied for identification. Contractor - The contractor shall provide all services, supplies, equipment and facilities necessary to provide the deliverables in this Statement of Work. DELIVERABLES. 1.  A teleconference presentation of the proposed work by the Contractor with EPA staff.  EPA staff and the Contractor shall discuss all detailed aspects of the project too complex to provide herein.

(b) Each contractor whose contract award is estimated to exceed $100,000 is required to register with the NIH CPS database at the following web address: https://cpscontractor.nih.gov.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
January 23, 2008


1. Cabin Boarding Stairs.   Can you provide additional information?  Is a side entrance door for the operator to enter and exit the main body area required, or, to enter, the operator unfolds the lift gate at the back end and enters thru the sliding doors?

ANSWER:  A way to access the cabin deck is needed so that the lift gate operators can get up to the cabin without having to use the lift gate (What if the lift gate isn?t operable?  A separate door into the cabin isn?t needed, but a way to get up to the sliding cabin door without the lift gate is required)

2.  Generator.  The spec calls for gasoline powered 10KW generator.  Do you mean an Onan model CMQD Quiet Diesel?

ANSWER:  Diesel fuel type for the generator

3.  Rear Lift.  Lift is called out in two places.  The 1st place is page 5 under general vehicle/van body.  The 2nd is on page 7.  Is the correct description on page 7?

ANSWER:  Page 7 is the correct statement on gurney/litter lift.

4.  Are you providing the gurneys or do we need to quote that also?
Also we need specs on the gurneys either way so that we can find the appropriate gurney racks that are called for.

ANSWER:  Gurney's aren't the requirement, litters are.  HDPLP requires the ability to carry 9 NATO standard litters.  These should be on a rack, so the litters are not floor loaded.  A three high litter rack system is the standard in AE operations.  Litter arms must accommodate the standard NATO litter and be capable of supporting 375 pounds per position.  Litter racks can be manufactured, or procured from a commercial company.  Specific dimension information is listed in the NATO Standardization Agency Agreement, Subject:  Stretcher, Bearing and Brackets and Attachment Support.

STATEMENT OF WORK

INTERPRETING SERVICES FOR DEAF COUNTERFEIT SPECIALIST 

BACKGROUND

The U.S. Secret Service in Washington, D.C. has a deaf Counterfeit Specialist in need of a dedicated sign language interpreter to be on the premises on a full-time basis to meet the employee?s communication needs.

OBJECTIVE

To procure the services of a contractor for interpreting services, to enable the U.S. Secret Service to provide effective communication between the deaf Counterfeit Specialist and individuals within the Secret Service as well as individuals from external sources.

QUALIFICATIONS

Interpreters contracted to work for the U.S. Secret Service must be Qualified/Certified members in good standing with the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID). These individuals must demonstrate high competence in and knowledge of ASL and transliteration. The contractor shall be able to understand, translate, and interpret technical terminology, laws, regulations, concepts, principles, practices, and procedures applicable to the Secret Service. Interpreting in legal or classified environments is highly desirable. Interpreters must possess knowledge of the Deaf Community and Deaf Culture. In addition, they must have obtained an education pertaining to the interpreting profession, and have a minimum of three years experience. 

The primary interpreter, and anyone backfilling in their absence during courtroom assignments, must be able to understand and interpret/translate legal terminology, and be qualified to perform in a courtroom setting.

Contractors must submit their resumes and a copy of RID certification with their proposal. Failure to submit these items will deem the contractor non-responsive and have the proposal rejected.

CLEARANCE

The interpreters must have a Top Secret security clearance.

SCOPE OF WORK

The contractor will provide dedicated, on-call sign language interpreting services on Mondays through Fridays from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. for the deaf Counterfeit Specialist. The services provided will be professional in nature and will be in accordance with the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf Code of Conduct. Under no circumstances will the interpreter represent the U.S. Secret Service or act as an official spokesperson on behalf of the agency.
In the event that the primary contractor is unable to perform as scheduled, the contractor shall arrange (in advance if possible) for a replacement interpreter, meeting the minimum requirements of the contract and possessing any clearances required for the assignment. This will include sick and vacation days. In such situations, payment of the replacement interpreter will be the responsibility of the contractor. The substituting interpreter must be RID certified and qualified. The Secret Service will not pay the contractor for Federal holidays that fall within their regular scheduled days, for days the Government closes for inclement weather, or for days that the deaf Counterfeit Specialist is on leave and the contractor has been provided a 48-hour notice. Some training/functions may require additional interpreters; however, notice will be given when there is a need.
 
Intermittent interpreting services may also be required from the contractor. Intermittent services are defined as services required in addition to the dedicated on-call position. The contractor shall provide interpreters who have appropriate clearances and qualifications, on an as-needed basis to satisfy this requirement. Examples of intermittent services include:
?	Interpreting assignments that are expected to exceed the standard period that an interpreter works continuously without a team, and based upon professional discretion, the contractor shall consult with the Supervisory Counterfeit Specialist to determine if an additional interpreter is necessary.
?	Other situations that require additional contracted personnel are those assignments that are two days or longer in duration (i.e. certain travel, instruction, training, conferences, and courtroom testimony).

The U.S. Government Standards of Conduct also applies.

The U.S. Secret Service will provide the necessary equipment and supplies needed for performance of duties.

MAJOR DUTIES

?	Interpret effectively into English and ASL to facilitate effective communication between the deaf Counterfeit Specialist and other individuals.
?	Interpret in all settings where services are required. Possible settings may include training classes, presentations, courtrooms, one-on-one meetings with supervisors, managers and employees, staff meetings and interviews.
?	Provide consultation to managers/supervisors concerning the profession of sign language interpreting.
?	Maintain involvement in the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) and other professionally related organizations and/or training programs.
?	Work closely with the U.S. Secret Service Contracting Officer Technical Representative concerning scheduling and/or matters relating to the provisions for services at U.S. Secret Service.
?	Maintain professional conduct, dress, and manner.

REQUESTS AND CANCELLATIONS

When possible, the schedule for daily interpreting services as well as preparation materials will be provided to the contractor in advance of the activity. Cancellation for daily on-call services as well as intermittent services will be provided to the contractor a minimum of 48 business hours in advance of the scheduled assignment.

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

All documents (both hard and soft copy) that are produced during the duration of the contract by the contractor for the government shall be considered government property and shall be provided back to the government upon termination of the contract, or upon request.

GUIDELINES

Guidelines consist of the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) Code of Conduct, the operational policies of the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity, the regulations set forth in Sections 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended. The contractor shall keep all documentation and information pertaining to the services they provide within the laws covering the Privacy Act, and shall consider all activity to be confidential in nature when servicing the Agency or individuals. 

TRANSPORTATION REQUIREMENTS

The contractor will be required to provide interpreting services to the deaf Counterfeit Specialist located at U.S. Secret Service Headquarters in Washington, D.C. The contractor must be willing to travel to other sites within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area as needed to include southern Maryland. Local travel, within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area will be the responsibility of the contractor. 

The contractor shall be available for domestic and foreign travel with the deaf Counterfeit Specialist to provide interpreting services for meetings, presentations, training, conferences, and expert witness trial testimony. Travel will be arranged through invitational travel.

WORK ENVIRONMENT

Work is performed in an office setting, laboratory, meeting room, classroom, courtroom, and/or auditorium. The demands of the services may require the contractor to provide long hours of service to the deaf Counterfeit Specialist, sometime standing without a break.

<DESC>This is an amendment to the previously-posted COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION located at http://www.fbo.gov/spg/DOI/OS/WAB/NBCW8Z00477/Combine%20Synopsis%5FSolicitation.html.  The intent of this amendment is to provide answers to vendor-submitted questions.  Additionally, this amendment hereby EXTENDS THE CLOSING DATE TO JANUARY 28 at 5:00 PM EST.         Offerors must submit their quotes containing the hourly rate, overall price, resume of proposed candidate(s) with relevant experience, as well as business info including DUNS, Tax ID Number (TIN), etc. via email to Lauren Kunze at lauren_c_kunze@nbc.gov .   All other terms and requirements in the initial solicitation will remain the same. QUESTION:  Is there is an incumbent for this requirement? If so, could you please provide the Contractor?s Name, Contract Number, Contract Value, and Expiration Date?   ANSWER:  There is no incumbent for this requirement.               QUESTION:  Can we submit two resumes for this position for the potential support engineers?   ANSWER:  Yes.                  QUESTION:  What are the most hours we can bill per month, how do we bill for replacement pairs, phone calls, travel, equipment and  etc. if needed for a repair?  ANSWER:  The resulting contract, as noted in the solicitation, will be a Time-&-Materials type.  As described in Section 5.1, the Government estimates a level of effort of 5 hrs per month.  However, offerors are encouraged to propose their best estimated level of effort and materials cost, and the resultant contract will be for a Not-To-Exceed amount of the awarded proposal (the Best Value based upon the evaluation factors in Section 18). No travel or phone call costs are to be allowable, as local resources are assumed to be available.  Any repair replacement parts or equipment will be purchased directly by the NIGC.                  QUESTION:  Is this position meant to be a full time position?   ANSWER:  No. Please refer to Section 5.1 and 5.2 of the original solicitation.              QUESTION:  How many persons are currently located at the Sacramento Facility?   ANSWER:  There are five staff members currently, and we may add one or two this year.              QUESTION:  How many personnel are anticipated for this solicitation?   ANSWER:  The Government anticipates need of just one computer consultant to perform this work.  However, as evident in a Time-and-Materials solicitation, offerors may propose their own solution.             QUESTION:  Is there a possibility that the deadline can be extended beyond the 25th?   ANSWER:  Yes, in order to give potential offerors adequate time to review questions and answers, and submit their final response, the CLOSING DATE IS HEREBY EXTENDED TO MONDAY, JANUARY 28 at 5:00 PM EST.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR BATTERY TEST SYSTEM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to notify vendors that the following questions have been answered: Q1) The statement of work talks about a channel with the power source capability of 80V and 50A.  But it also talks about the system requirements not exceeding 120V at 30A.  These two statements are contradictory.  What is the power capability of the power source for each channel?  Using the system requirements we would expect each channel to be about 300W, is this correct? A1) This statement is refering to the type of connectors and power available. The following is stated: "1.2.1	The test system needs to have a utility service connection for 208VAC single-phase 60Hz (50A) , 240VAC three phase 60 Hz (50A), or 120VAC single phase 60 Hz (30A),." The vendor may use any of the above listed connections to provide adequate power to the test system.  The per channel requirements is 4kW (80V X 50A) as stated in the SOW. Q2) Is it possible to have 12 controllers, one for each channel, as long as the computer can control all of them without timing problems?  A2) Yes. Q3) Do we need to be aware of the different types of batteries and their individual charging procedures, or is there only one charging procedure?  A3) No, The profiles mentioned in the SOW will cover Li-Ion, and Ni-Cad which are our two main types of profiles.  Q4) Due to the high cost of the material content of this project, can we expect progress payments for this project if they are requested?  A4) This procurement shall be a firm fixed price contract, however milestone payments may be negotiated after award. (FAR) 52.232-32 Performance-Based Payments The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on January 17, 2008. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP); solicitation number is TIRNO-08-R-00007, and a firm fixed price, indefinite deliver/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract is contemplated.  In this solicitation document, the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-22 effective 23 November 2007.   The North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) 611710 with a business size standard of $6.5 million applies to this procurement.     This procurement is 100% small business set-aside.   
All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.   The Treasury Executive Institute (TEI) has a requirement to procure the following: 

Background
The Treasury Executive Institute (TEI) is Treasury's lifelong learning center for federal government senior level executives and corporate leaders.  TEI currently has two major categories of executive learning programs: seminars and workshops on leadership, management and public service; and book discussions on a variety of topics.  The book discussions fall into one of three series: an Explorer Series, Sustainability Series, and Leaders from History Series.  The goal of the book discussion series is to bring thought leaders from other disciplines to government leaders.  TEI seeks distinguished authors - Pulitzer Prize winners and nominees, New York Times Bestseller list, etc.  TEI also seeks authors of books on contemporary issues that impact executives and the bureaus that they run.  Potential subject areas include - but are not limited to - science, history, economics, arts, social issues, international affairs, philosophy, psychology and medicine.  TEI seeks to obtain these speakers at little or no fee.

Objectives

The target audience is Federal executives and senior level personnel from Treasury bureaus and Treasury-legacy bureaus who are clients of TEI.  TEI projects offering an average of four book discussions per month, with an estimated annual total of 48 sessions. The number of book discussion sessions may vary depending on the availability of funds and selected speakers. 

Scope

In satisfaction of TEI's requirement to deliver authors approved by the TEI Director and appropriate to the target audience, the Contractor shall perform the following:
