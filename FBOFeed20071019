<DESC>The NASA, John C. Stennis Space Center has recently been selected as the test site for the construction of a new A-3 Altitude Test Facility.  The new test facility will provide an altitude propulsion test capability which will enable the Constellation Program’s Exploration Launch Office, J-2X Project Element to validate the performance of the J2-X engine for the upper stage of the new Ares I launch vehicle.  The A-3 Altitude Test Facility will be constructed for long term altitude rocket propulsion testing at Stennis Space Center. While the construction of the A-3 Altitude Facility will involve a significant number of individual procurement actions this requirement is solely focused on the equipment required for the facility Control System (CS); Red-Line Detection System (RLDS); and Hazardous Gas Detection System (HGDS).	This pre-solicitation synopsis is to request industry feedback regarding the provision, testing, delivery, and site support of the CS equipment required for Stennis Space Center.  Interested parties shall indicate initial evaluation of compliance with the requirements stated below. The A-3 Facility Control System consists of the facility controllers and Graphical User Interface (GUI) on WorkStations (WSs) positioned at various operator consoles.	Most of the CS hardware is located in the Signal Conditioning Buildings (SCBs) or the test stand (which are either on the stand or on the ground level near the stand), providing input/output channels to facility components and support hardware.  The GUI screens in the TCC (as well as screens provided in each SCB) provide operator access to control valves and events remotely and to monitor status of components (valves, instrumentation, system status, etc.).  Critical parameters are received in the controllers through either signal conditioners, direct input to the processor chassis, or a Data Acquisition System (DAS) data stream including DAS status.  This DAS data stream may be either of Fibre Channel or Ethernet protocol and must interface directly to the controller chassis.  The CS interfaces to the test article via a test article interface system, which is yet to be defined.  Additional CS hardware is located in the TCC receiving hardwired inputs and sending outputs to the rest of the facility control system.  The controllers also receive remote switch inputs, control console inputs and interfaces with a watch dog timer, or controller heartbeat.  The watch dog timer is monitored and will initiate an emergency shutdown (or restrict test-start commands) should the controller heartbeat be lost after a pre-determined amount of lost cycles.

<SUBJECT>B --Rollover Tests to Support National Highway Safety Administration Rulemaking
<SOLNBR>DTRT57-07-R-20026
<RESPDATE>060107
<CONTACT>Point of Contact -Donna Brickley, Contract Specialist, 617-494-3661
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovation Technology Administration, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), intends to issue a solicitation for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract in support of the National Highway Safety Administration (NHTSA) to acquire the services necessary to prepare and conduct NHTSA?s New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) Light Vehicle Dynamic Rollover Propensity Tests, collect test data results, and prepare reports describing vehicle responses during the dynamic rollover tests.  NHTSA recently issued a final rule known as the Stars on Cars that requires each new passenger automobile to be rated under the NCAP and to have those ratings displayed on a label on its new vehicle price sticker.  The results of these rollover tests will be used to supply consumers with comparative ratings of the dynamic rollover resistance of vehicles from model years 2008 through 2011.  In previous years, dynamic rollover tests were conducted on the Vehicle Dynamics Area (VDA) of the Transportation Research Center located in East Liberty, Ohio and on the test surface located at Dynamics Research Inc. located in Torrance, California.  These two surfaces are constructed to provide a uniform pavement friction and flat surface profile to a far greater degree than what is provided by ordinary highway techniques.  It?s mandatory that interested Contractors possess a test surface with the same uniform pavement friction and flat surface profile that will enable NHTSA?s dynamic rollover test to achieve the high level of test-to-test repeatability necessary for valid comparisons of vehicle performance.  It?s anticipated that a minimum of five (5) rollover maneuver tests will be conducted per year to a maximum of fifty (50) tests per year.  The period of performance for this contract will be four (4) years from the date of contract award.  The Government may consider making multiple contract awards.  Task orders will be issued after contract award and if multiple contract awards are made, then task orders will be competed.  The solicitation will be issued on or about June 21, 2007.  Proposals will be due approximately 30 days after the issuance of the solicitation.  The solicitation and related documents will be available in electronic format only on the Volpe Center Acquisition Division home page on the World Wide Web (www).  Paper copies of these documents will not be available.  These documents will be available in text format and will reside on a server which may be accessed using www browsers.  The www address is: http://www.volpe.dot.gov/procure/index.html.  Contractors desiring to receive a copy of the solicitation and any related documents must register at this site to receive electronic notification of the solicitation posting and availability for downloading.  Contractors are warned that when they register to receive solicitations, amendments, and other notices, the responsibility for providing the Government with an accurate and complete email address lies with the Contractor.  The Government will make no additional effort to deliver information when the system indicates that transmissions cannot be delivered to the email address provided.  For questions concerning this acquisition, contact the contracting official by email at Brickley@volpe.dot.gov.  ANY INQUIRIES VIA TELEPHONE WILL NOT BE HONORED.  NOTE: All Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to receive an award from a U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Agency.  Contractors may access the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov to register and/or obtain information about the registration process.  Additionally, the solicitation?s Representation and Certifications are no longer provided within the solicitation and must be submitted online through the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA).

<DESC>PR Number(s): FD20300870582 Item: 0001 NSN: 2915013432931PRPR SENSOR,TEMPERATURE, P/N: 1534M60P04,  Description: Temperature is sensed by a helium-filled sensing coil acting upon sensing bellows attached to a metering valve.  A second bellows is reference bellows.  Pressurized helium gas in sensing coil reacts to temperature changes.  When temperature increases, gas pressure increases.   When temperature decreases, gas pressure decreases. Control servo pressure (PC) is supplied through a fixed orifice in main engine control.  Pressure between fixed orifice and metering valve is P6 Pressure.  Pressure (P6) is regulated to that required to overcome force of helium acting on sensing bellows, plus force of preload springs, plus force of bypass pressure (PD) acting on reference bellows.  This interaction of forces regulats P6 at a constant value above PD at a constant value above PD at a given temperature.  An increases in temperature expands helium gas in sensing coil and sensing bellows.  As sensing bellows expands, opening at metering valve is decreased.  A smaller amount of P6 is than blec to PD, thus increasing P6 pressure. A temperature decrease in helium-filled sensing coil causes gas to contract.  As gas contracts, metering valve opens farther, bleeding more P6 pressure to PD, and P6 pressure decreases.  The reference bellows allows for variations in PD and is used to maintain absolute pressure reference.  FUNCTION:  The sensor is a temperature sensor and transducer unit for main engine control.  It responds to changes in fan discharge temperature and regulates pressure as a function of discharge temperature.  DIMENSIONS:  'Sensor body/length 3.000inches, width 4.390 inches, height 2.400 inches.  Temperature coil dimensions:  length 7.188 inches, width 2.750 inches, height 2.750 inches, weight (dry) 2.82 lbs, signal pressures 24.1-182.4 PSI above main fuel pump boost pressure and proportional to temperature, filter screen size 70 microns (nominal), pressure line  connection0.562-18 UNF-3A thread, temperature range -65F to 480F.  MATERIAL:  consists of aluminum exterior surfaces anodized per MIL-L-8625 class I Type II. Total Line Item Qty: 23.0000    Destn: FB2039,Tinker AFB,OK.,73145-9013.  Delivery: 31 May 2008 No telephone requests. Only written or faxed requests received directly from the requestors are acceptable. Erin.Akin@tinker.af.mil Qualification Requirements: Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined the Government to be similar in complexity and criticality, can be considered approved sources for this item.  Current qualified source is:  General Electric CC 07482, Woodward Governor CC66503.

A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK, Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) - SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11 Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and 3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent, understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0 requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

The contract will be acquired using Source Selection procedures as identified in FAR 15.3 with a firm fixed price award to the offerors who provide the best value to the Government.  This procurement shall be set-aside for Hubzone certified firms.  Offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit and price proposals.  The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are significantly more important than price.  The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  1.  Past Performance on Similar Projects, 2.  Technical and Organizational Approach, and 3.  Key Personnel Qualifications.  Past Performance on Similar Projects is significantly more important than any other factor.

The solicitation package (Including specifications, drawings, offer forms, clauses, and provisions) will only be available electronically. It will be available on or about November 8, 2007.  

Offerors MUST be registered in the Contractor?s Central Registration (CCR) database in order to participate in this procurement.  The website for CCR is http://www.ccr.gov.  Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS). 
The solicitation will not be available on the FedBizOpps website.  The solicitation can only be obtained by accessing a secure website known as FedTeDS.  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition material.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and/or additional information.  Potential offerors must register on the FedTeDS website to have access to solicitation material.  This registration includes providing a Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN).  For additional information, visit the FedTeDS website, www.fedteds.gov or the CCR website, www.ccr.gov.     

Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company?s ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.

Any information taken from other publications is used at the sole risk of the offeror.  The procuring office cannot guarantee the accuracy of information contained in other publications.

Boeing will provide parts support for repair actions through dedicated material management which includes material lay-ins, identification of replacements and advance technology insertion.  Additionally, Boeing may utilize Fleet Readiness Centers (FRCs) to accomplish repairs. Commercial Service Agreements between Boeing and FRCs established under Performance Based Logistics Contract N0038306D001J will facilitate the subject repair effort.  This requirement is restricted to MDC/Boeing, the Aircraft prime manufacturer, because MDC/Boeing is the only source that possess the requisite knowledge and expertise to complete complex repairs resulting from the lack of historical repair data. Repairs are expected to be unique to each individual unit.  See Note 22 and 26.

<DESC>A-Cardiovascular Health Study-Transition Phase Renewal.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with University of Washington to maintain core coordinating center support for the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) (management of data, blood, and MRI repositories; coordination of study operations; tracking of paper and ancillary study proposals and data and materials distribution); provide to NHLBI regularly updated limited access data sets and summary data and descriptive statistics upon request; amplify genomic DNA to bolster volumes available for future genetic research; and provide free analytic support to new researchers.  In addition to coordinating study operations and ensuring participant safety and confidentiality, the contractor, through the CHS Steering Committee, will provide access to CHS resources and expertise, scientific collaborations with other non-profit and for-profit organizations, and mentorship of early-career investigators.  Contract support for the three-year period is expected to be combined with additional funding from investigator-initiated ancillary studies to fully cover coordinating center costs and to conduct scientific investigations.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The incumbent contractor, as the CHS Coordinating Center since 1988, has the unique capability to provide these required services to the NHLBI for the transition phase of this study.  The CHS Coordinating Center serves as the repository for the vast CHS data set and provides statistical expertise to support CHS and collaborating investigators in its use.  Over the past ninteen years the coordinating center has acquired a level of familiarity with CHS's operational methods, study variables, and analytical procedures that is needed for making further scientific progress.  Successful study management, timely coordination of new data collection efforts in multiple concurrent ancillary studies, and optimal sharing of limited study resources is dependent on continued participation of current contractor staff.  Interested respondents must submit written capability statements demonstrating their ability to perform these services, including senior scientific and analytic staff and facilities.  Responses providing insufficient information for evaluation will not be considered.  This is not a Request For Proposals.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>****SEND ALL INFORMATION FOR CONSIDERATION TO CAMERON D. GREEN AT CAMERON.D.GREEN@NASA.GOV, OR FAX TO 256-544-4401**** NASA/MSFC has a requirement for (44) test motors. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items on a sole source basis from GLobe Motors. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: This procurement is for electrical motors that will be used in existing test hardware in EM10's High Vacuum Test Facility. The motors are replacements for exisiting motors made by GLobe Motors and must fit in the mounting plate specifically designed for these motors. The motors must have wiring connections that are compatible to exisiting electrical supply controls and fittings. Market research indicates that there is no other known source (manufacturer or distributer) other than Globe Motors that makes the required motors. NASA has urgent need to procure these motors to support bearing testing in support of the NESC Independent Technical Assessment of the effects Lunar Dust on Mechanical Systems. No other vendor can supply these items in a timely manner. Any other vendor will have to custom make these units so the reliability and compatibility of these units with exisiting hardware would be questionable. This would be an expensive process and will delay delivery. This procurement is a sole-source.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact, Cameron D. Green at CAMERON.D.GREEN@UNA.EDU, Fax: 256-544-4401 no later than October 29th, 2007 at 4:00p.CST  4:30 p.m.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>In accordance with the authority set forth under 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1, NIEHS intends to negotiate with Research Triangle Institute (RTI), on a sole source basis, to expand the Phase I, short-term reproductive toxicity study under contract number HHSN291200775564C, entitled Reproductive Assessment by Continuous Breeding (RACB) awarded on May 1, 2007.  The objective of the Phase I study is to assess the specific abilities of RTI to perform those factors stated in the Statement of Work which include:  1) perform the protocol, 2) obtain the anticipated result(s), 3) adhere to approved protocols, 4) demonstrate appropriate record keeping procedures, 5) diagnose problems, and 6) evaluate results.  In order to effectively perform the assessment the Government finds the expansion from a single generation study to a three generation study scientifically necessary; the expansion will provide a greater amount of data and allow for a more detailed and powerful assessment of the Phase I study. The expansion involves increasing the level of effort, cost, and period of performance currently afforded to the Phase I, short-term study of a single generation of test animals, to allow for the level of effort necessary to perform a multi generation study for three generations of test animals.  The newly defined Phase I study will increase the period of performance from January 31, 2008 to December 31, 2008.  If RTI performs the Phase I study in an acceptable manner, the Government intends to exercise Option 1 for reproductive toxicity testing of NTP test articles at the estimated rate of 5-8 per year for a period of performance of five years. The incumbent contractor, RTI, has the unique capability to provide the required services to NIEHS for continuation of this study due to their unique capabilities in areas such as: technical approach, qualified personnel, and management plans necessary to perform this highly specialized requirement.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this study. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This amendment is to furnished to make corrections to the solicitation and provide answers in response to questions received from perspective offerors.
 

Question 1.  Can the prime contractor who wins the MSS contract place orders for parts and components against the GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts?

Answer 1. No. The use of GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts in the performance of this contract will not be authorized.


Question 2  Paragraph D.2.16.2 seems to contradict the language in paragraph D.2.2.3 of the solicitation that states that ?COT?s items were used in the development of the prototypes and are mentioned in this document as examples??  Can you clarify this apparent contradiction?

Answer 2. The statement in D.2.16.2 is an editing error.  The sentence that reads ?These components meet the Government?s requirement for this system.? is hereby deleted in its entirety.  The prototype information contained in this solicitation is furnished to provide a representation of the type of system that the Government feels will meet its current operational objectives. 
 
Additionally, Paragraph D.2.2.3 - Prototype Development is changed to read as follows:

To resolve certain operational and implementation problems that previously stalled the RVS project, CBP has pursued the development and testing of a mobile surveillance system.  A prototype concept was developed, and over an eighteen months period four prototype systems were built and field tested.  This effort has resulted in a prototype that is highly functional, easy to set up and operate, reliable, comprised of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components and sub-assemblies that are interchangeable (can be replaced with spares), easily maintained, and meets the CBP operational needs.  The criterion used to develop the fourth prototype unit is used as the functional baseline for this requirement.  Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) items were used in the development of the prototypes and are mentioned in this document as examples of the types of products that can be integrated into this MSS solution.  The prototype uses pre-engineered sensor architecture with modular, self-contained, battery operated, hardwired and/or wireless connections, integrated detection sensors and day and thermal imaging suites intended for wide area automated surveillance during daylight, darkness, and adverse weather conditions.  The components used to build the prototype MSSs were selected based on their qualifications to meet the Government?s objectives at the time the prototypes were built.  

[The note at the end of this paragraph remains, unchanged.]

Question 3.  To alleviate any potential misinterpretation resulting from these various statements please confirm that it is an accurate interpretation of the solicitation that only if an offeror chooses to replace a prototype item with an alternate must the offeror plan to prove the replacement item meets the items performance requirements defined in paragraph D.2.4.3, meets the MSS system requirements defined in paragraph D.2.4.6. and perform the system compliance and verification testing defined in paragraph D.2.12.1.  

Answer 3.  The Government did not track requirement changes made since completion of the prototype.  Where the Government has injected the word ?desired? into the any portion of a component specification, it is an indication that the Government is looking for greater capability than furnished by the prototype and that the prototype component may not meet the current requirement.  In any case, proposing the exact prototype components does not absolve an offeror from due diligence in meeting this requirement.  Additionally, although a component may meet the component specification, the offeror still has the obligation to meet the functional requirements (Solicitation Paragraph D.2.4.2).  There are many variables in the way the system can be configured to meet functional objectives.  System configuration and meeting these objectives is the responsibility of the offerors.


Question 4.  Did a small business develop the MSS prototype under contract to GSA?  

Answer 4.  No.  The prototype was developed in-house by the government with assembly assistance from component suppliers, as needed.


Question 5.   Regarding the RFP package 
(1)  Figure 8 Trailer - The information contained on that page is not legible. (2)  Figure 7 Control Panel - Parts for this panel are not identified.  (3) Figure 14 Sensor Control Management Module -  Power distribution manufacturer part number not provided.  (4) Cable manufacturer is not identified.  Can you provide missing information?

Answer 5.  The government provided the photos as representative.  There are many ancillary components that the government did not identify.  The government has sufficiently identified 22 major components and thoroughly explained component and system functionality. It is not the government's intent to provide a "how to" guide to build the prototype system, but to communicate the functional and technical requirements as well as the major components the government used to meet them.  It is up to industry to provide their best of breed.


Question 6.  63 - Mobile Surveillance System, Performance Requirement Details, 21.0 Mobile Deployment System,  21a.0 Telescoping Mast Performance requirements. 21a.3 Mast Deployment [reads] ?deployment of the mast unit.........using a power assist cable-winch mechanism or hydraulic mechanism.?  Does this limit deployment only to the mechanisms stated? There are pneumatically driven masts available. Are those forbidden or can they be proposed accompanied by an explanation? 

Answer 6.  It is not the intention of the Government to be limiting in regard to the mast lift mechanism, provided that the proposed mechanism does not infringe upon other aspects of the specification.  Accordingly, the language in solicitation paragraph D.2.4.3 ? 21a-3 is changed to read ?Deployment of the mast unit from transport mode to full operational capability is accomplished by a single operator in a maximum of 15 minutes using a power assist cable-winch, hydraulic, or other mechanism.?  
 
 
Question 7.  [Paragraph D.2.4.3 - 22.0 Electrical Power System Performance Requirements, 22.4 Generator Size and Capacity [reads] ?A 5kW generator is the minimum acceptable size.?  This size and capacity generator (5000 Watts) could supply power to several homes. Unless it is thought that power would be provided to other components outside of the trailer, depending on the circumstances, this seems like way over kill. Any comment? 

Answer 7.  The generator size is a firm requirement.  The requirement is the result of field testing of generator units in the proposed operational environment.  


Question 8.  In order to adequately assess our ability to meet the March and August 2008 delivery dates for base and option quantity CLIN?s, please provide an expected contract award date. (Paragraph D.5.2)

Answer 8.  An award is planned on or before 20 December 2007; however,  the exact award date is contingent upon a variety of unknown factors that may affect the procurement process.  

Question 9.  The note in section D.2.2.3 cautions the offerors that the there are subsequent engineering revisions beyond what is identified by the Item Description(s) provided in the SOW.  Please provide the information that will permit us to understand the items effected, the specific engineering revisions as well as the part number or rev?s of the items that we should be quoting that do ?meet the government?s objectives? for the prototype configuration .

Answer 9.   See the answer to question 3.

 
Question 10.  Paragraph D.2.6.4 defines a requirement to deliver drawings.  The delivery is not covered by a CLIN in section D.1.1 nor is a delivery specified in section D.5.2.  Please advise if the requirement should be CLIN0001e, NSP with the price included in another CLIN or some other mechanism for defining the price.  Please also clarify if drawings are required in March, August or at some other date.

Answer 10.  This is an oversight in the solicitation.  The as-built drawings are added to Paragraph D.1.1 as 0001e, not separately priced, the price to be included in the price of 0001.  As-built drawings, one electronic copy and three hardcopy, are to be delivered on or before 26 March 2008, to location B.  Offerors should propose to furnish as-built drawing in a format that is standard to the industry.  If the Government requires a specific format it will be specified in a subsequent solicitation modification on or before 2 November 2007. 

Question 11.  Please clarify if there is a specific rev level associated with the software embedded in the Sensor Control Management Module, Model: Brain Box. (Reference paragraph D.2.16.2 13a.)

Answer 11.   We do not have this information.  It is suggested that you contact the vendor listed in the prototype component list for this information, Solicitation Paragraph D.2.16.2.
.


Question 12.  Paragraph D.2.6.3 requires a list of spares be provided.  Please clarify if the list is to include pricing.  Please also identify how many systems will be deployed over the 12 month period as quantities cannot be recommended without knowing the fielded quantity during the specified timeframe.

Answer 12.  The spare parts list need not include pricing.  Recommended spare parts should be per deployed system for 12 months.

 
Question 13.  Paragraph D.2.4.6.5(b) refers to a vibration profile in paragraph D.2.4.6.1(d).  Please provide the profile.

Answer 13.  The sentence in Paragraph D.2.4.6.1(d) that concludes, ??shocks typically encountered during transportation over rough terrain, field handling, setup and operation of the system? constitutes the profile for vibration.  


 Question 14.  Paragraph D.2.4.6.5(b) suggests the system will be subjected to shock and vibration for an average of 37.0 minutes per operational hour.  Please clarify which components will be expected to be operational while the vehicle is moving.

Answer 14.  As stated in Paragraph D.2.4.3,  Note:	The MSS is not intended to operate during transit mode.  However, some shock and especially vibration will occur during the operation of the MSS (i.e., from the generator) and all components must meet the vibration requirement. 
 
 
Question 15.  Please provide the quantity per MSS for each of the 22 items identified in the table in paragraph D.2.16.2. 

Answer 15.  One each, unless otherwise called for by the individual specification requirements or the offeror?s individual design.


Reference Paragraph D.2.4.3-1.2 ? Operational Range.  For consistency the first sentence of the description is changed to read, ?0 to >/= 10 km. Capable of 90% probability of recognition of a walking human (.75m x .75m target size) at 10 km from the imager.?

<DESC>PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 030 (28 MAR 05) – Capabilities Development Document (CDD)  A current version of the Personnel Recovery Vehicle CDD is available for  industry review and comment.  Please note this documents falls  under “DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of  Defense (DoD) and DoD Contractor’s only to protect technical or operational  data…”  To request a copy of the CDD, please send an email request to  SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only).   It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C. Fisher  by COB 08 April 2005.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or c.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.

Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.

We plan to hold these sessions 29 March  through 1 April at Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS  See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101 dated 9  July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003).    PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various  AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 030 (28 MAR 05) – Capabilities Development  Document (CDD)  A current version of the Personnel Recovery Vehicle CDD is available for  industry review and comment.  Please note this documents falls  under “DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of  Defense (DoD) and DoD Contractor’s only to protect technical or operational  data…”  To request a copy of the CDD, please send an email request to  SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only).   It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C. Fisher  by COB 08 April 2005.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter  under “DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of  Defense (DoD) and DoD Contractor’s only to protect technical or operational  data…”  To request a copy of the CDD, please send an email request to  SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only).   It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C. Fisher  by COB 08 April 2005.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 028 (08 MAR 05)- Correction of Capt  Thompson+s phone number (reference: Amendment 027) Phone:  937-255-4560 Email:  Gary.Thompson@wpafb.af.mil  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 027 (07 MAR 05) - Draft SRD  An updated version of the draft Systems Requirement Document (SRD), Rev 3,  dated 7 March 2005 is available for review and comment.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS  See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101 dated 9  July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003).    PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various  AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 031 (12 MAY 05) - Draft RFP The PRV Flight has issued a draft RFP for SDD and initial Production efforts  for industry review and comment.  Please provide review comments to ASC/LUH no  later than 26 May 2005. Current plans are to provide for face to face  discussions of contractor comments during the week of 6 June 2005.  Please  contact the individuals listed below to establish date for discussions. Additional data will be provided as it becomes available for release  (ie.  DD254, Sections L+M, and data items).  The SRD, Training SRD, ISP, and SCG should be requested from Mr. Emil DeMusz,  or Mr. Don Fisher. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 030 (28 MAR 05) – Capabilities Development  Document (CDD)  A current version of the Personnel Recovery Vehicle CDD is available for  industry review and comment.  Please note this documents falls  under “DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of  Defense (DoD) and DoD Contractor’s only to protect technical or operational  data…”  To request a copy of the CDD, please send an email request to  SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only).   It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C. Fisher  by COB 08 April 2005.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

The SRD, Training SRD, ISP, and SCG should be requested from Mr. Emil DeMusz,  or Mr. Don Fisher. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 030 (28 MAR 05) – Capabilities Development  Document (CDD)  A current version of the Personnel Recovery Vehicle CDD is available for  industry review and comment.  Please note this documents falls bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various  AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

Please provide review comments to ASC/LUH no  later than 26 May 2005. Current plans are to provide for face to face  discussions of contractor comments during the week of 6 June 2005.  Please  contact the individuals listed below to establish date for discussions. Additional data will be provided as it becomes available for release  (ie.  DD254, Sections L+M, and data items).  The SRD, Training SRD, ISP, and SCG should be requested from Mr. Emil DeMusz,  or Mr. Don Fisher. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 030 (28 MAR 05) – Capabilities Development  Document (CDD)  A current version of the Personnel Recovery Vehicle CDD is available for  industry review and comment.  Please note this documents falls  under “DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of  Defense (DoD) and DoD Contractor’s only to protect technical or operational  data…”  To request a copy of the CDD, please send an email request to  SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only).   It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C. Fisher  by COB 08 April 2005.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

Please provide review comments to ASC/LUH no  later than 26 May 2005. Current plans are to provide for face to face  discussions of contractor comments during the week of 6 June 2005.  Please  contact the individuals listed below to establish date for discussions. Additional data will be provided as it becomes available for release  (ie.  DD254, Sections L+M, and data items).  The SRD, Training SRD, ISP, and SCG should be requested from Mr. Emil DeMusz,  or Mr. Don Fisher. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 030 (28 MAR 05) – Capabilities Development  Document (CDD)  A current version of the Personnel Recovery Vehicle CDD is available for  industry review and comment.  Please note this documents falls  under “DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of  Defense (DoD) and DoD Contractor’s only to protect technical or operational  data…”  To request a copy of the CDD, please send an email request to  SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only).   It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C. Fisher  by COB 08 April 2005.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.

This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document).

Please contact the individuals listed below to establish date for  discussions. Additional data will be provided as it becomes available for release (i.e. data  items). PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 031 (12 MAY 05) - Draft RFP The PRV Flight has issued a draft RFP for SDD and initial Production efforts  for industry review and comment.  Please provide review comments to ASC/LUH no  later than 26 May 2005. Current plans are to provide for face to face  discussions of contractor comments during the week of 6 June 2005.  Please  contact the individuals listed below to establish date for discussions. Additional data will be provided as it becomes available for release  (ie.  DD254, Sections L+M, and data items).  The SRD, Training SRD, ISP, and SCG should be requested from Mr. Emil DeMusz,  or Mr. Don Fisher. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 030 (28 MAR 05) – Capabilities Development  Document (CDD)  A current version of the Personnel Recovery Vehicle CDD is available for  industry review and comment.  Please note this documents falls  under “DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of  Defense (DoD) and DoD Contractor’s only to protect technical or operational  data…”  To request a copy of the CDD, please send an email request to  SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only).   It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C. Fisher  by COB 08 April 2005.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various  AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.

Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User.

Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and 3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the  intent, understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed  the CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload  require the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full  extent to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational  Capability (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings  and those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10  (defined as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no  markings or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a  Block 0 requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements  as stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for  Information See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule  reduction efforts The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors  who have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The  goal of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of  the PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated value of $1.25M each.

<CONTACT>Barry Foster, 937-904-6674
<DESC>TITLE:  F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) Modernization Program BACKGROUND:  The F-15 ESTS Modernization Program is an Aeronautical  Systems Center (ASC) program.  The F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS)  is an Intermediate – level support equipment system providing maintenance  & repair for approximately 50 F-15 Line Replaceable Units (LRU).  The  system consists of a station, Interface Test Adapters (ITA), ancillary  equipment, and associated cables located at all F-15 operating locations  and the depot at Robins as well as Northrop-Grumman, Rolling Meadows, Ill.  The station (62 units) itself will become increasingly difficult to  maintain and ultimately unsustainable beginning in FY08 unless known  obsolescence for a variety of component parts is addressed.  A projected  component obsolescence analysis is attached for reference purposes. PURPOSE:  The F-15 Systems Group, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting a  survey to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise,  capabilities, and experience to analyze ESTS station instrument  obsolescence as currently fielded, identify potential solutions for same,  and demonstrate capability to replace obsolete parts as necessary.  The  overarching program objective is to avoid stations becoming Not Mission  Capable (NMC).  The government plans to issue, at a later date, a request  for proposal that will require offerors to provide a plan that provides  retrofit hardware improvements addressing obsolete parts within the  planned funding profile and meets the overarching program objective.  The  planned funding profile is as follows:  FY08 - $4.5M, FY09 - $12.1M,  FY10 - $13.4M, FY11 - $19.6M.  Respondents should maximize addressing the  projected component obsolescence issues within the planned funding  profile, i.e., address as many components as possible with the given  amount of funding.  In addition, offerors will be required to demonstrate  improvement to station MTBF as well as meeting the current performance  requirements.  In order to assist respondents with replying to this  sources sought synopsis a draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) is attached. CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY:  Firms responding to this announcement  should indicate whether they are a large or small business, small  disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, HUB Zone small  business and/or service disabled veteran-owned small business.  In  addition to the information requested above, please provide the following  information:  Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, CAGE Code, Phone  Number, E-mail address, Web Page URL.  In addition to the information  above, interested firms should also submit sufficient information (limited  to 25 pages) that will permit insight into their technical capabilities. 1.	Provide experience and expertise in aspects related to addressing  obsolescence of electronic equipment in general and specifically  obsolescence associated with support equipment. 2.	Describe firm attributes that enhance ability to excel in the execution  of the aforementioned program objectives. (Example:  ISO 9000, Software  Capability Maturity Model (CMM) level, etc.) 3.	Describe vendor relationships in the support equipment industry to  include the primary vendors and the components that will be available to  address obsolescence of the ESTS system. Information should be pertinent and specific to the manufacturing or  supply capabilities noted above.  Information marked “proprietary” will be  protected and will not be divulged unless mandated by existing laws. All information is due not later than 1600 hours Eastern Daylight Savings  Time, 12 February 2007.  Send information in Microsoft Word format  electronically and in hard copy to Mr. Bob Krueger and Mr. Mike Pepin,  912th AESG/VA, Bldg 553, 2725 C Street, WPAFB OH 45433-7424.

<DESC>National Security Technologies, LLC (NSTec) is seeking sources interested in fabricating items as identified:

There are two projects that will run concurrently. One is to develop a Photomultiplier Tube (PMT) based upon an unorthodox design concept, and a Photodiode (PD) whose design that is outside normal production schemes.
 
PMT notes:
Physical size (about 4.5" diameter x 3.5" long)
There are multiple wires that penetrate through an optical window into the vacuum chamber.  These wires are strategically position and vacuum tight.  The sketches for this design show external pump-out capabilities, but remote processing can be considered, too.  There are very complicated features that are not shown mainly because they are 1) company sensitive information and 2) they will be developed by NSTec and provided for processing and assembly within the tiny vacuum chamber.  This first present phase determines if anyone can make this particular vacuum chamber (and the optical window) with reasonable reliability and effort.
 
The sketch with dimensions: The vertical dimensions are diameters. 
 
PD notes:
Physical size (about 1.32" diameter x 3.3" long)
This is the heart of the device to be developed.  Not much thought has gone into sealing techniques between the metal, conical vacuum chamber and the optical window since everyone has their own established techniques and experience.  This particular component appears to be a candidate for remote vacuum processing.
 
This optical window also has a wire that penetrates into the vacuum chamber, is vacuum-tight, and is located at the center of the window.  There are other components within the tiny vacuum chamber, but like the PMT concept, the information is company sensitive.  Many of the components will be made, processed and assembled by the company who is interested in the work.  However, NSTec will provide all of the specifications/drawings to make these parts, and will provide some of the unique components.
 
All of this information will be in much greater detail when it is established who is interested in doing the work.  At that time there will be in place a non-disclosure agreement to cover discussions regarding company proprietary information. 

Interested parties are requested to provide company name, point of contact, business size, and a statement of capabilities to Emma Fox via email at foxeb@nv.doe.gov no later than October 29, 2007.

<RESPDATE>112107
<CONTACT>Contracting Officer POC: Mr. Rodney Fultz, 812-854-8756 Technical POC: Mr. Chuck Zellar,812-854-5767
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/synopcom.htm.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable. The United States Navy is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement and request for information as part of a market survey seeking potential sources and information for an automatic small arms targeting system.  The government is currently defining its minimum requirements and seeks input from industry on the current state of the art for automatic small arms targeting systems.  The government is seeking systems that preferably use Windows based programming and can be operated using a standard PC or laptop computer.  The system would be installed at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane, Indiana, outdoor range facility and will require ability to conduct firing on a minimum of two lanes, at various ranges, simultaneously to allow for maximum usage of the outdoor range facility.  The targeting systems may either be wireless or hardwired. If hardwiring is required, no external power greater than 110 volts will be necessary.  It is anticipated that the system, once mounted, wil!  l be exposed to the elements of southern Indiana weather and humidity 365 days per year.    It is anticipated that the automatic small arms targeting system would be capable of  accepting the following weapon and ballistic information inputs via direct keyboard inputs or pull down menus: File name (may be automatically generated), Date (automatically generated),  Time (automatically generated), Weapon Data{Weapon nomenclature, Serial Number}, Ammunition Data{Caliber, Lot Number, Projectile Mass, Target data{Operator/Shooter, Range, Type of target} and if velocity can be taken{position of start and stop screens} It is anticipated that the automatic small arms targeting system would generate the following shot information: Number Shots fired, Number Shots recorded, horizontal and vertical position of each shot, remaining velocity for each shot, remaining energy for each shot, Time of flight for each shot, time to engage target for each shot, miss distance, Chronograph Velocity, Wind Speed (at time of firing) at the target location and at the firing point, Wind direction (at time of firing) at the target location and at the firing point, and overall Cyclic Rate of Fire for the total number of shots fired in the automatic / burst mode.  It is requested that the information be provided in English units via a toggle type button on the display. It is anticipated that the automatic small arms targeting system would generate the following shot group data: Horizontal mean point of impact, Furthest left, Furthest right, Vertical mean point of impact, Highest round, Lowest round, Horizontal Std dev, Extreme spread horizontal, Extreme spread vertical, Vertical Std dev, Radial Point of impact, Group size {extreme spread [inches, MOA, MILS], mean radius, circular error probable} Velocity,  lowest velocity at target, Velocity at target { High, low, mean , Std dev}, Energy at target { High, low, mean, Std dev} It is requested that the information be provided in English units and readily converted to metric units via a toggle type button on the display. It is anticipated that the automatic small arms targeting system would generate the following Graphic data detailing: Target outline, Shots graphically placed on target, Numbered shots, Missed shots noted, Line between max shots, Mean radius, and CEP.  (Ideally the graphically displayed data could have features that could be toggled on or off determining how much data is graphically actually displayed.) The automatic small arms targeting system would provide the average Center of Impact for up to five round groups and display them with group number and location on the target. It is anticipated that the automatic small arms targeting system would generate printed reports using a standard laser or inkjet type printer and standard printer software. Exporting of data into standard file formats such as text, RTF, CSV, Adobe PDF, MS Word and MS Excel is desired. Interested vendors should submit the following information regarding its Targeting System(s).  Please submit performance capabilities and cost estimates in English measurements and US currency: a.

<SUBJECT>B -- Health Information Security and Privacy Collaboration (HISPC)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-08ACF101907
<RESPDATE>110807
<ARCHDATE>11232007
<CONTACT>Allison Ford, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-0101, Fax 301-443-3849, Email aford@psc.gov - Janet Miller, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-2478, Fax 301-443-3238, Email janet.miller3@ees.hhs.gov
<DESC>In late 2005 HHS awarded Research Triangle Institute International (RTI) a contract to collaborate with the states, territories, and other state-level stakeholders to: (1) assess variations in organization-level business policies and state laws that affect health information exchange; (2) identify and propose practical solutions, while preserving the privacy and security requirements in applicable Federal and state laws and (3) develop detailed plans to implement solutions.  Subsequently, through an open competition, RTI solicited governor-endorsed entities within states and territories to submit proposals to be part of the RTI-led Health Information Privacy and Security Collaboration (HISPC) to complete this work.  A total of thirty-four state and territory based entities were selected and funded by RTI as subcontractors to be part of the HISPC.  At the conclusion of the HISPC's first phase of work, states and territories developed implementation plans to address privacy and security variations in organization-level business policies and state laws that affect health information exchange in their jurisdiction.  

Since July 2007, HISPC states and territories have been (1) working on a foundational piece of their implementation plan and (2) developing collaboration strategies for multi-state privacy and security solutions to foster or facilitate nationwide electronic health information exchange.  Moreover, RTI has coordinated the recruitment of additional states and territories to be part of the HISPC and at last count nine states and one territory (with several more showing interest) have taken part in the initial collaborative strategy development meetings.  It is clear that both old and new members of the HISPC are passionate and excited about the opportunity to work collaboratively and develop solutions to help advance the national health IT agenda.  Continuing this work without delay and preserving the momentum recently achieved through the addition of new states and territories to the HISPC is of great importance.  The Government is acutely concerned that any break in performance due to finding a new contractor to manage the HISPC would cause a decline in participation and put the states and territories that make up the HISPC (whose collaborative work is the main purpose of the project) at a significant disadvantage. Such a result would unravel critical connections formed over the past year and a half and pose significant challenges to those states and territories developing coordinated privacy and security solutions for nationwide electronic health information exchange.  Therefore, HHS intends to award on a sole source basis, a contract to RTI to continue their work with the HISPC in the form of funding, managing, and coordinating the multi-state collaborative work of old and new HISPC members.  During the contract period of performance RTI will at a minimum, be responsible for ensuring that the states and territories: (1) implement their collaboration strategies; (2) meet the goals established by their collaboration strategies; (3) ensure cross communication between interdependent collaborative groups; (4) report on the collaborative work accomplished and its impacts; and (5) coordinate administrative and logistical activities needed by the multi-state collaboratives including bi-weekly conference calls and in-person meetings.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may submit capability statements with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government's requirement that shall at a minimum, describe your: (1) ability to rapidly, within 4 weeks, establish sub-contractual relationships with all current and new HISPC states and territories; (2) ability to demonstrate a performance model that allows for the maximum amount of Federal dollars to be provided to participating states and territories; (3) capacity to maintain a high degree of cross state/territory collaboration; (4) knowledge of the project, its goals, and overall state and territory privacy and security issues related to electronic health information exchange; (5) experience in subcontracting with multiple states and territories; and (6) ability to quickly assemble an executive team or panel of privacy and security experts to advise and mentor multi-state collaboratives;  No solicitation document is available.  Capability statements shall be submitted within 21 days from the date of publication of this synopsis to the contact point and address given below.

REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION

555 ACSS/GFEA B-1 Organic Technical Order Sustainment System & Support - Integrated Data for Maintenance (IDM)

The B-1 System Program Office at Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC) is responsible for the management, distribution and sustainment of over 600 Technical Orders.  This infrastructure includes both DoD standard systems and locally developed systems used for the management, conversion, storage and retrieval of digital technical data.

Services to support technical data (technical order documents and system modification data) processes and infrastructure are required in the following major categories:

?	Electronic capture, conversion, and update processes.
?	Acquisition, installation, development, administration and configuration management of a complete suite of SGML/XML publishing and content management software tools
?	Technical support services to manage, maintain, and administer all computing hardware and software utilized to support the management, creation, sustainment, storage and distribution of B-1 TOs.

The electronic capture, conversion, and update functions are a large portion of the technical data management function and consume a large part of available funding.  These functions include activities related to the transition of data from one format to another, more intelligent format.  At the lowest level, conversion processes facilitate the transition of paper documents to portable document format (PDF) or indexed portable document format (IPDF).  Data may be further transitioned to a desktop publishing (DTP) system, to standardized general markup language (SGML), to eXtensible Markup Language (XML), and/or ultimately to Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs).  Conversion efforts center on increasing the intelligence level of source data with improved functionality/interactivity for customers.    

Technical support services include system administration, database management/administration, and technical support services for all hardware infrastructure and software components utilized in the capture, storage, maintenance, electronic distribution, and editorial processes.  The following is a limited list of major components planned for use to accomplish B-1 technical data management processes:


?	The Joint Computer-Aided Logistics Support System (JCALS) provides tools to acquire, manage, access, and update technical manuals.

?	XyEnterprise Professional Publisher (XPP) ? A commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) product used for the composition of SGML/XML.  Government-owned style libraries based on AF Military Specifications determine the resultant output (IPDF) format.  XPP Markup Language, Omnimark, Perl, and XyPerl scripts are used in conjunction with this software.

?	XyEnterprise Content@ - COTS Oracle-based (v. 10g) content management system.  Uses a bridge (eBuildProducer) to interact with XPP for SGML composition.  Also has an interface for FrameMaker & Epic to accomplish editorial production/sustainment. 

?	PTC Epic Editor ? COTS SGML editor used for authoring technical documents.  Air Force Document Type Definition (DTD) files are utilized in conjunction with this software.

?	TPM4 ? COTS product used to transform SGML documents to XML documents.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Proposed addition of Double-Sided Tape to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of a street broom by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:

Tape, Double-Sided
7510-00-NIB-0825
7510-00-NIB-0826
7510-00-NIB-0827

The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, New York.
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Double-Sided Tape to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:

3M 667		3M 3136
3M 109		3M 137
3M 136		3M 137DM-2

In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing Double-Sided Tape to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than November 14, 2007 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed product be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

Similar products are:

3M PF121			3M PF190
3M PF121W			3M PF400L

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing Notebook Filters to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than November 14, 2007 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed product be added to the P/L.

<SUBJECT>A--COMMERCIAL ORBITAL TRANSPORTATION SERVICES "COTS" PHASE 1 DEMONSTRATION
<DESC>As a continuation of the COTS Phase 1 project, NASA/JSC plans to solicit proposals from all interested industry participants for Earth to orbit space flight demonstrations of any combination of the following mission capabilities:  A) External unpressurized cargo delivery and disposal,  B) Internal pressurized cargo delivery and disposal,  C) Internal pressurized cargo delivery, return and recovery, D) Crew Transportation.  The demonstration(s) would culminate with a rendezvous and docking or berthing with the International Space Station (or another suitable alternate test bed) and disposal or recovery of cargo. Proposals for mission capability D, crew transportation, would be considered for execution only after the successful demonstration of mission capability C.  The objective of these space flight capability demonstrations is to stimulate the commercial space transportation market to help develop safe, reliable, and cost effective access to and from low-Earth orbit.   NASA plans to use its Space Act authority to enter into one or more funded agreements.  Because a primary purpose of a NASA investment would be to facilitate commercial orbital transportation service capabilities for, in part, U.S. Government use, NASA would consider proposals only from U.S. commercial providers as defined by the Commercial Space Act of 1998.  NASA plans to release an announcement soliciting proposals on October 22, 2007.  Responses would be due 30 days later, with agreements executed in early 2008.   Potential respondents are responsible for monitoring the Internet site for the release of the announcement and for downloading their own copy of the announcement and amendments (if any). Any referenced numbered notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".  The announcement and any related documents will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 



Closing date and time for receipt of offers is November 09, 2007, 3:00 p.m., EST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.

Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer).

DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute.

(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [  ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

<DESC>Amendment to include questions/answers.

1.    Since you indicated that the solicitation is an RFQ, how much detail and narrative information does the Agency require as a component of the response and as necessary for a determination?
 
The Agency has no specific requirement, however, sufficient information should be provided to allow the Agency to evaluate the qualifications of the consultant and the suggested approach that would be taken for the review, including discussions on how the consultant will approach the technical requirements and accomplish the work.  The Agency has no page limit. 

2. Does the Agency intend to contract for services based on the responses received? 

Yes, the Agency intends to contract after reviewing all responses from companies bidding on the contract. 

 
3. As the Agency indicates an urgent need for completion of the contract within 60 days from date of award, how soon after the response date (10/26/07) will responses be reviewed and how quickly thereafter does the Agency anticipate a decision to award the contract?  
 
It is anticipated that the contract will be awarded no later than 2 weeks after the response date.


4. What is the length of time required to complete Post-Commission training?

No specific length of time is required for completion of the Post-Commission training program.  Employees may select more than one Post-Commission specialty area.  Generally, employees will pursue one specialty area at a time.  

5. What is an estimate number of persons involved in the FCA Examiner training process during a calendar year, including all stages of Pre- and Post-Commission?
 
Currently there are 34 pre-commission examiners.  Approximately 10 new pre-commission examiners are hired per year.  Currently there are 126 post-commission examiners.  

6. What is an estimate number of FCA Examiners who have completed the current training process since inception?
 
The formal pre-commission training program began in 1986.  Several hundred have completed the pre-commission training program but are no longer with the Agency (e.g. retired, downsized, left for other jobs).

7. Are all FCA Examiners, Pre- and Post-Commission, based in McLean, Virginia?  If not, where are they located?

No, pre- and post-commission examiners are located at all FCA locations throughout the country:  McLean, VA; Sacramento, CA; Dallas, TX; Denver, CO; and Bloomington, MN.  Post-commission examiners are generally equally distributed among these five locations.  

8. Is this review of the Farm Credit Administration's (FCA) Pre and Post Commission Examiner Training Program the first review that FCA has completed? If not, how often have previous reviews been completed? What were the results of those reviews?

This is the first external review of the FCA post-commission training program. Since it's inception in 1986, the pre-commission training program has been reviewed numerous times with minor modifications.  

9. Under Scope on page two of the Statement of Work (SOW), the SOW states that the "...scope of the review is ... to determine whether the Agency is effectively using its resources in the most efficient way to train its staff."

a. What existing metrics does the FCA use to determine efficiency in its personnel training programs? Examples of metrics could include:
i. Stated level of satisfaction with the training program by trainers, students,
leadership team, etc.;
ii. Retention of program students by the FCA during and after completion of the
program;
iii. Cost per entering student and cost per graduating student.

FCA does not use a formal metrics system to determine efficiency in its training programs.  This is something we would like the contractor to do.  However, at the conclusion of each training program an evaluation of the course content and instructors is given to all students.  Learning and retention is determined by if the student passes the commissioning test at the conclusion of all formal and on-the-job training programs. 

10. Under "Deliverables" on page three of the SOW, the SOW states that the review will "[b]enchmark FCA's delivery methodology ...against best practices in the federal government and private practice."

a. What set or group of "best practices in the federal government and private practice"
does FCA's management want to use in the review?
b. Is FCA's management interested in employing benchmarks used by similar federal entities (e.g., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Reserve System, or the Office of Federal Enterprise Housing Oversight)?
c. Are there other benchmarks that FCA's management would like to use for this review? If so, what are they?

FCA would like the contractor to benchmark federal bank regulators including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Thrift Supervision, Federal Reserve Board, National Credit Union Association, and Office of the Federal Enterprise Housing Oversight.  Other optional organizations will be determined in consultation with the contractor.  

11. Under "Term of the Contract" on page four of the SOW, the SOW states that this review will need to be completed "...within 60 days from the date of award."

a. How soon does FCA's management expect this project to begin (e.g. Nov/Dec 2007 or January 2008)?
b. When does FCA's management want this project to be completely finished, including the submission of the final report and the completion of all review related meetings with FCA's management?

It is anticipated that the contract will be awarded no later than two weeks after the submission deadline. Work will begin in November and the contractor should provide FCA with the final report in January 2008. 

12. Other than local travel in and around the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, what are the out-of-town travel necessities to complete this review? Will the reasonable expenses for that travel be reimbursed by FCA?

In addition to visits to McLean, it is anticipated that the contractor will make one visit to FCA offices in Dallas, TX and Sacramento, CA.  At the discretion of the contractor in consultation with FCA, the contractor may visit the remaining FCA offices throughout the country which includes Denver, CO and Minneapolis, MN.  Since the contract is firm fixed price contract, travel expenses are the responsibility of the contractor. 

13. Will FCA's management permit in-person and telephone interviews between the selected consultant and members of FCA's professional staff as part of this review?

Yes, in person and telephone interviews are encouraged.  

14.  Is there an incumbent contractor currently providing these services?

No.

15.  Will SMEs or instructors be available (e.g., by phone or via email) for interviews regarding the training? 
 
Yes

16.  Will past participants be available (e.g., by phone or via email) for interviews regarding the training? 
 
Yes
 
17.  Will we be able to review the scores for any written or on-the-job assessments that participants have completed during the course? 
 
Yes 

18.  Will some observation of ongoing training be possible? 
 
Yes

CLAIMS FOR RELIEF 

Any claim for relief filed by a offeror shall be adjudicated by the FCA Contracting Officer. If the parties cannot reach an agreement mutually satisfactory after diligently pursuing a solution through discussions and negotiations, the FCA Contracting Officer shall make a final decision. The FCA Contracting Officer's decision shall prevail unless the offeror submits an appeal to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The decision of the CFO shall be final and binding on the parties.
