SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORKSTATEMENT

C.1.	Project Title:	Communities for All Ages

C.2.	Background:

	The Administration on Aging (AoA) is required by Congress to conduct a White House Conference on Aging by the end of calendar year 2005.  During the year preceding the conference, AoA provides guidance to local communities across the country to frame their grassroots efforts to develop policy recommendations that will be shared at the conference.  The 2005 White House Conference on Aging is tentatively scheduled to occur in October 2005.  In order to enable counties to adequately prepare for the conference, AoA must provide the Communities for All Ages framework to the counties by September 2004 and have the case study descriptions and other technical assistance materials ready for departmental clearance by May 2005.

C.3.	Purpose:

	The purpose of this Contract is to:  (1) conduct a county-level competitive process to identify the top eight leading models of Communities for All Ages; and (2) develop a written guide consisting of case study descriptions of the models, along with other relevant technical assistance materials for use by other counties nationwide.  The Contractor shall develop the criteria upon which the model counties will be selected.  The criteria will serve as the guiding framework for the 2005 White House Conference on Aging.  All counties will use this framework to prepare their recommendations for the conference. The Contractor shall work with the selected counties to assist them in developing their case study descriptions and other technical assistance materials, which shall include an implementation guide and manual for counties to replicate these successful models.  AoA shall announce the availability of the case studies and technical assistance material at the conference.  The grantees will present their models at the conference in order to facilitate peer-to-peer learning and exchange with other counties from across the country

C.4.	General Requirements:

	The Contractor shall receive, process, log, track and reproduce and distribute documents in a way that assures, timely, accurate and cost efficient processing.  It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to retain hard copies of all documents at their site in a location that is easily accessible by the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) and Project Monitor (PM).
C.5.	Specific Tasks:

	Task 1:	Project Management Plan:

	The Contractor shall prepare a Project Management Plan describing the technical approach, organizational resources and management controls to be employed to meet the cost, performance and schedule requirements for this effort.  The Project Management Plan shall detail methods, allocation of staff and other resources necessary to provide the service and revised time lines, if necessary.  The COTR and PM shall receive the revised Project Management Plan in both hard copy and electronic from, Microsoft Word.  Based on the Project Management Plan, the PM will provide approval to move forward on activities planned.  The Contractor shall request prior approval on all activities not included in the plan or any adjustments to the plan after approval has been given.

	Task 2:	Selection Criteria:

	In partnership with AoA, N4A, AARP, Visiting Nurse Service of New York (VNSNY), National Council on Disability (NCD) and National Organization on Disability (NOD), and possibly other organizations specified by AoA, the Contractor shall develop a list of criteria for the selection of the model counties, and instructions and formats that the selected counties will use in developing their case study descriptions and other technical assistance materials.  The selection criteria will capture the key components of a livable community for all ages.  Applicants will receive higher scores for addressing a greater number of components.

	Task 3:	Management of Request For Proposal Process:

	The Contractor shall issue the Request for Proposals to identify the eight models of Communities for All Ages.  The Contractor shall manage the review and selection process, based on the selection criteria developed in Task 2.

	Task 4:	Implementation Guide:

	The Contractor shall develop a web-based Communities for All Ages Implementation Guide and Workbook, based on the eight county-based models.  This workbook will encompass the full scope of the livable community concept.  Counties will be able to choose the components of the concept that they will address to achieve the full vision.

	Task 5:	Travel Arrangements to White House Conference on Aging:

	The Contractor shall arrange travel, lodging, and per diem for representatives of the county models to participate in the 2005 White House Conference on Aging.  Approximately 16 representatives will be involved in the event that will showcase the eight models.

	Task 6:	Final Report:

	The Contractor shall provide draft and final reports to the PM at the conclusion of work summarizing objectives achieved, significant issues, problems and recommendations to improve the process in the future.

Sole Source Solicitation

	This proposed negotiated acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (F.A.R. 6.302-1).  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed negotiated acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Contractors may forward capability statements demonstrating their ability to the referenced address.  Electronic submissions are acceptable, but must be received prior to the close of business (5:00pm) on the response date.

SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORKSTATEMENT

C.1.	TITLE

	Community of Practice for Local Health Information Infrastructures

C.2.	BACKGROUND

	The National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) is envisioned as the technologies, standards, laws, policies, programs and practices that enable health information to be appropriately and safely shared among health decision-makers, including consumers and patients, to promote improvements in health and healthcare. The development of a vision for the NHII began more than a decade ago when an Institute of Medicine report, (The Computer-Based Patient Record), investigated computerized patient records and concluded “a major coordinated national effort with federal funding and strong advisory support from private sector is needed to accelerate the pace of change in the United States.”  A recent report from the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS), entitled Information for Health: A Strategy for Building the National Health Information Infrastructure (http://ncvhs.hhs.gov/nhiilayo.pdf), reaffirmed the importance of the NHII.  The path to a national network of healthcare information is through the development and networking of local initiatives linking health data sources with users. Such local systems are called Local Health Information Infrastructures (LHII).

	The widely acknowledged lack of coordination and communication among United States healthcare programs and health data systems result in services that are not well integrated or coordinated.  Poorly integrated services result in: delays in delivery and inadequate care; an increase of morbidity, mortality, and disability; and attendant healthcare costs to the family and individual (The Institute of Medicine, To Err is Human, 1999 [http://www.iom.edu/includes/dbfile.asp?id=4117] and Crossing the Quality Chasm 2001  [http://www.iom.edu/includes/dbfile.asp?id=4124]).

	Past attempts to develop integrated health care data systems were limited by management and procedural issues. Lorenzi in Strategies for Creating Successful Local Health Information Infrastructure Initiatives December, 2003 (http://aspe.hhs.gov/sp/nhii/LHII-Lorenzi-12.16.03.pdf) identifies barriers that caused early LHIIs to stumble. She says,

	“The earlier health information sharing experiment was called, Community Health Information Network (CHIN). Nearly all failed. CHINs were an intellectually supported “concept”, but were not fully conceptualized at the implementation level. Most efforts were disbanded because of organizational barriers to their success, that is:

	1.	Buy-in because of conflicting missions and poorly conceived objectives
	2.	Perceived loss of control and lack of trust in the process.
	3.	Lack of clear ownership over data systems and information.
	4.	Lack of clarity about how a CHIN would be financed.
	5.	Less sophisticated technology along with the perceived need for a centralized community-based data repository.”

	Detmer also has considered healthcare data integration and notes several hurdles to the development of integrated health information systems (Detmer D. It is about health: securing a National Health Information Infrastructure in The National Quality Forum, Information Technology and Healthcare 2003 [http://www.qualityforum.org/txITSummitFINALPUBLICprint.pdf ])

	Detmer’s bottlenecks are:

	1.	Technical – need for standards and multiplicity of vendors;
	2.	Financial – the costs of acquiring and operating IT systems;
	3.	Legal – ownership of the data and fraud and abuse rules that hamper collaboration;
	4.	Cultural and organizational – resistance to change;
	5.	Personnel – trained manpower;
	6.	Leadership – need for strong visionary leadership.

	Despite these difficulties healthcare data integration is a burgeoning issue. To envision an LHII or the NHII consider existing large scale information systems; for example the SABRE airline reservations system, commercial inventory management, and banking ATM machines. Such systems provide information where and when needed around the world with privacy and authority. These, however, are single focus networks with limited and specific types of data. Healthcare is multidimensional and exponentially more complex requiring demographic, economic, geographic, physical, laboratory, and image data for use by clinics, pharmacies, hospitals, payers, public health, and consumers.

	Even now, local networks of health care providers (physicians, hospitals, and ancillary health care workers), public health organizations, payers, employers, insurers, and citizens groups are germinating with the purpose of sharing health care information for effective diagnosis and treatment, improving community health, and mitigating the effects of bioterror and newly emerging infectious disease.  These local health information infrastructures are the foundation stones from which the NHII shall rise as a national structure. These nascent LHIIs may be as small as a county immunization registry and as large as a metropolitan area such as Indianapolis enjoys. LHIIs are composed of at least two geographically close institutions with the goal of sharing data; a group practice, even a large PPO or HMO would not be considered an LHII unless it participates in a collaborative data sharing with another local organization.

	Aware of failures of previous community health networks, those striving to solve this problem have expressed interest in coming together to share knowledge, experiences, and strategies for the creation and sustainability of Local Health Information Infrastructures (LHIIs).  A course of action with a track record of success in organizing and managing complex knowledge challenges is to form an interest group in order to collaborate, to share ideas, to discuss best practices, and to synthesize experiences. A generic name for  such an organization of similar organizations is a “community of practice” (CoP). A Community of practice (CoP) is network of people and organizations that share a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a topic; who work together, usually in a facilitated manner, to improve one another’s knowledge and expertise and to share this knowledge with the broader field of endeavor.  Wenger suggests that a Community of Practice will:

	1.	Provide resolutions to institutionally generated conflicts;
	2.	Support a community memory that allows individuals to do their work without having to remember everything;
	3.	Helps newcomers;
	4.	Generates specific perspectives and terms to enable accomplishing what needs too  be done;
	5.	Makes the job easier. (Wenger EC, Snyder WM. Communities of Practice: the organization frontier. Harvard Business Review 2000).

	Por suggests that Communities of Practice can:

	1.	Solve problems;
	2.	Develop and verify best practices;
	3.	Upgrade and distribute knowledge in daily use;
	4.	Foster unexpected ideas and innovations (www.co-i-l.com/coil/knowledge-garden/CoP/thought.shtml).

C.3.	PURPOSE

	The purpose of this project is to develop a CoP for LHIIs, and to use the CoP to energize the development of LHIIs nationally. The contractor will over the course of three years undertake a two stage process. They will define and develop a CoP for LHIIs and will then use this CoP for LHIIs to facilitate the development of LHIIs. The contractor will define in specific terms how community of practice concepts translate into specific activities or a “model of practice” for local health information infrastructure projects.

	The contractor will develop a framework (i.e., set of steps and activities) necessary for establishing a “Community of practice” for LHIIs. This framework may use and build on existing CoP and LHII knowledge. The contractor will formulate a framework for action that will guide the formation, growth and continued operation of a LHII community of practice. The contractor will identify and prioritize problems to be addressed and assess the most effective means for involving health care stakeholders relevant to LHII.  The contractor will identify a process that leads to formation, operation and maintenance of a community of practice that produces tangible knowledge products (e.g., lessons learned, best practices, templates supporting key practices, etc.) and makes them available to others.

	LHIIs will benefit from participating the CoP. They will have the opportunity at first hand to understand and participate in the nine key elements critical to success for an IT integration project. These elements are: leadership, project governance, project management, stakeholder involvement, organizational and technical strategy, technical support and coordination, financial support and management, policy support, and evaluation (Public Health Informatics Institute. Integration of Newborn Screening and Genetic Service Systems with Other Maternal & Child Health Systems: A Sourcebook for Planning and Development 2003). These elements directly address many of the root causes of failure noted above. The CoP knowledge exchanges are a tremendous incentive for those involved in LHIIs, with their eye on success, to participate in the CoP.

C.4.	Work Description:

	The work will begin by providing a review of community of practice concepts and of local and regional healthcare information systems and their efforts to integrate. The contractor will take note of, build on, and refine work already done in this area including:

	*	Lorenzi N. Strategies for Creating Successful Local Health Information Infrastructure Initiatives December, 2003
	*	Public Health Informatics Institute. Connections: Creating a Roadmap. 2003 http://www.allkidscount.org/pdfs/CreatingRoadMap.pdf
	*	Public Health Informatics Institute. Integration of Newborn Screening and Genetic Service Systems with Other Maternal & Child Health Systems: A Tool for Assessment and Planning 2003.  http://www.allkidscount.org/pdfs/HRSAsourcebook.pdf
	*	Wenger EC, Snyder WM. Communities of Practice: the organization frontier. Harvard Business Review 2000

	The outlined tasks and deliverables propose to translate such ongoing work and concepts into a model of practice for local healthcare information integration with agreed upon core elements, functions and performance measures.

	Year 1 defines the long-range vision for the community of practice.  The formulation of the “model of practice” is a collaborative process with key stakeholders.  It includes prioritizing integration steps, establishing preliminary core functions for the integrated system, and drafting potential indicators to measure the performance across systems. The key deliverables for year one are the formation of the CoP with a plan for sustainability and a white paper describing the model of practice for integration.

	Year 2 (OPTIONAL) expands the conceptual vision from Year 1 to recommendations for transitioning from current practices to the model of practice and the identification and testing of performance indicators for the new model of practice for LHIIs.  Deliverables will include stakeholder-supported identified policy and practical issues, core functions, standards, and performance measures summarized in reports.

	Year 3 (OPTIONAL) will build upon work in the first two years by refining and retesting the performance measures and build a policy case for the adoption of the model of practice for integration.  The final deliverable for Year 3 is the required information to assist the policy case for integrating healthcare data and information systems programs with other public health programs and their systems.  The information will be presented to NHII/ASPE and other federal, state, and community stakeholders.

C.5.	TASKS

	The Contractor shall perform the tasks indicated below. And all deliverables are subject to the review and approval of the NHII GPO.

	YEAR 1

	Year 1 has three significant steps to conceptualize and define a CoP for LHIIs and to begin to use the CoP to define a model of practice for LHIIs.

	Task 1:	Meeting with NHII GPO

	Task 1.1:	Discuss the scope of the task ahead, including but not limited to: goals and objectives, processes, time frames, priorities, budgetary issues, deliverables related to the work to be performed and other related activities of the contractor for the purpose of reviewing, clarifying and confirming the process and outcome expectations of NHII/ASPE.

	Task 2:	Select seven (7) members from Private, Public, and Community Sectors to participate in workgroup to develop the community of practice

	Task 2.1:	In collaboration with NHII GPO, establish criteria to select workgroup members;

	Task 2.2:	Assess progress and status of current LHIIs to identify which ones will participate in the workgroup;

	Task 2.3:	Select expert and key stakeholder partners such as organizational behavior and informatics policy experts, provider and family organizations and public agencies to join workgroup;

	Task 2.4:	Conduct conference call with NHII and workgroup to discuss project and identify workgroup roles and responsibilities;

	Task 2.5:	Identify no more than nine (9) LHII “partners” who will participate as “founding members” in the CoP

	Task 3:	Using the CoP begin to define the “Model of Practice” for integrating local healthcare data and information systems

	Task 3.1:	Bring together workgroup and LHII partners to discuss and define the model of practice for integration of healthcare data and information systems and prioritize integration steps. This shall be a one and one half day meeting in Washington DC as close as possible to the NHII04 meeting, with one hotel night, expenses, and airfare for the 16 workgroup and LHII partners paid by the contract;

	Task 3.2:	Engage in an on-going dialogue with workgroup regarding definition, core functions, and standards of practice for the model. The dialogue shall include site visits to LHIIs as necessary;

	Task 3.3:	Synthesize and Analyze Existing Policies and Recommendations for Integrating Healthcare data and information systems;

	Task 3.4:	Conduct a comparative analysis of selected policies and standards of practice and identify how they support or conflict with each other

	Task 3.5:	In collaboration with the workgroup, draft and disseminate a white paper of no more than 70 pages that describes the problem and issues confronting newborn LHIIs, defines a model of practice for integration, identifies key elements, definitions, core functions for the model, and raises issues that need further attention.

This data will be used to supplement the surveillance of asthma by State health departments and CDC and could eventually be part of a national network. Incident asthma surveillance sites will be population-based centers designed to assess the public health impact of asthma, to determine the incidence of asthma and to identify population-based risk factors associated with the onset of asthma. This program is designed to foster development of a physician-based reporting system, specifically, a system for the surveillance of incident cases of asthma utilizing health management plans. These model surveillance systems will help to identify incident cases of asthma to determine trends in the incidence and epidemiology of asthma.

SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES

BACKGROUND

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), intends to award a contract for the fabrication of four refrigerated insect release machines with double insect containment boxes to include the fabrication of 16 insect containment boxes.  This equipment is necessary to support the Mexican fruit fly eradication programs in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, and other Mexican fruit fly infestations in the United States.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION FOR CHILLED STERILE FLY CONTAINMENT/DISPERSAL EQUIPMENT FOR MEXICAN FRUIT FLY CONTROL

The fly containment and dispersal machine developed by USDA, APHIS, PPQ, Aircraft and Equipment Operations (AEO), is a 28-volt DC electro-mechanical assembly comprised of an aircraft grade extrusions and alclad sheet metal housing configured in the form of an “L” fitted with one fly containment box.

The vertical section and short side of the “L” contains all of the electrical controls, air conditioning components, and connectors for aircraft and external electrical power sources.  The uppermost compartment of the vertical section supports the condenser and blower assembly.  The center section houses a two-cylinder (6 cubic inch) piston type compressor which is driven by an electrical 28-volt DC motor.  The center compartment houses the evaporator blower, motor, and the received-drier assembly.  The lower compartment houses the evaporator, blower assembly, and pressure regulator assembly.  The lower compartments also serve as the refrigerated air supply and return plenum.

The horizontal base section contains the fly ejection systems which is made up of three nylon augers, longitudinally mounted and equally spaced in parallel.  The augers are driven by one 28 volt electrical stepping motor which is equipped with a High Torque Drive (HTD) pulley and three HTD belts.  The base serves as the main refrigerated and return air duct assembly, and is the main support for both the fly containment box and the dispersal machine-to-aircraft mount.  The auger system provides the method of the extraction of the flies from the base of the containment box to the transition duct through the fly ejection gate.  This fly ejection gate is an electrical servo operated rectangular nylon plate which slides open for fly release and is closed for fly retention.

The fly containment/dispersal equipment described above has the capacity for holding approximately 2.5 million Mexican fruit fly adults.  The equipment is capable of maintaining an internal temperature of 39 degrees Fahrenheit (plus or minus two degrees) at all times while the equipment is loaded with flies and for the duration of each dispersal mission.  Temperature control is extremely vital to the success of each dispersal mission.  Temperatures above the specified range result in physical damage to the flies due to movement of the flies at the higher temperature, and also makes dispersal of the flies difficult because they cling together at the higher temperatures.  Temperatures below the specified range cause damage to the flies due to hypothermia.  Configuration and construction of the containment equipment provides for constant and equal air circulation throughout the containment compartment for the duration of each dispersal flight.

The dispersal mechanism is capable of dispersing flies from the containment compartment to the outside of the aircraft at variable rates.  The equipment also has the capability for rapid evacuation of the total amount of flies from the containment compartment to the outside of the aircraft in the event of an aborted mission in order to prevent the return of the flies to the base of operations.

CONSTRUCTION AND SPECIAL SPECIFICATIONS

The equipment shall be constructed based on the above description and attached drawings with the following specifics.

1.  The unit shall include two fly containment boxes rather than one described above.

2.  Dual flight augers, 3 ½” diameter, 3” pitch.

3.  Thermal insulation for machine and insect containment boxes.

4.  Four each independent adjustable potentiometers to provide four independent adjustable auger speed selections at the remote control.  Auger speeds:  Minimum 0.8 RPM  Maximum 21 RPM.

5.  Pre-chill lids for the release machine auger base assembly.

6.  Evaporator coil blower capacity to be at least 600 CFM (FASCO double outlet blower, single speed, 24 VDC, 600 CFM, Model 2898-092-003, or equivalent.)

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA).    THIS NOCA WAS ORIGINALLY ISSUED UNDER THE NAME OF APPLICATIONS OF LIDAR FOR VEHICLES WITH ANALYSIS (ALVA), F29601-03-R-0003, AND WAS PUBLISHED IN NOVEMBER 18, 2003.  DUE TO A CHANGE IN NAME, SOLICITATION NUMBER AND RESPONSE DATE, THIS NOCA WITH ACCOMPANYING RFP IS BEING REPUBLISHED UNDER ITS NEW NAME AND NUMBER.  Contracting Point of Contact:  Marialyn Achille-Argaez, Contracting Officer, (505) 846-6876, Technical Points of Contact:  Dr. Victor Gamiz, (Active Characterization, (505) 846-4846), Dr. John Gonglewski (Tactical Fire Control and Imaging, 505-362-2731) and Ms. Laura Ulibarri (Space Situational Awareness, (505) 846-8928).  This announcement is to notify all interested parties that the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy Directorate (DE), Kirtland AFB, NM at Kirtland AFB, NM anticipates releasing a solicitation FA9451-04-R-0001 on or about 29 Dec 03 for Lidar Applications for Vehicles with Analysis (LAVA).  The acquisition will be solicited on a full and open competition basis.  Proposals are due on 12 Feb 04.  No Draft Request For Proposal (DRFP) will be issued for this acquisition; however, documents contained in the RFP will be immediately uploaded on the FedBizOpps electronic posting system as they become available and may be downloaded at Internet site: http://www.eps.gov.  EPS offers automatic update notification on changes to this announcement.  Amendments, and questions and answers concerning the announcement, will be posted exclusively on FedBizOpps.  All posted information will clearly display its date of posting.  Offerors are reminded of the requirement to acknowledge all amendments in their proposal.  Upon request a site visit to the Hawaii facilities will be scheduled.  An indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity, cost-plus-fixed-fee, task order type contract is contemplated (CPFF ID/IQ).  The contractual effort will consist of one (1) award for a contract with an ordering period of five (5) years from the date of award.  The estimated maximum contract value is $49.9M. This estimated dollar amount is subject to adjustments that may be appropriate for the Government to take full advantage of the contract ordering period. The overall security classification of the contract is expected to be SECRET. Offerors are required to state whether they are a small businesses, qualifying 8(a) businesses, or historically black college, university and minority institution.   BACKGROUND:  The Air Force Research Laboratory’s Advanced Optics and Imaging Division is seeking to acquire design, fabrication, test, evaluation, deployment of Lidars, laser radars, laser metrology, and complementary passive sensor systems in ground-based, airborne, space-borne, or special test facilities.   Included is support to USAF assets and test sites for prototyping and understanding the role of non-weapons class lasers, laser radars, laser sensing, remote sensing and measurement systems, and general imaging systems.  Program planning and mission analysis for such systems as appropriate is part of this effort.  Assets include the Maui Space Surveillance System  (MSSS); USAF’s Argus or Cobra Ball or similar aircraft; Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB); and other DoD service facilities such as White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) and the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) at Barking Sands, Kauai. At least 20% of this effort involves support of the Maui Space Surveillance System (MSSS) on Maui, Barking Sands in Kauai, and other USAF facilities in Hawaii, such as Air Force HI-CLASS, MSSS, Maui High Performance Computing Center (MHPCC), and Remote Maui Experiment (RME) facilities on Maui, and the Barking Sands facility and the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) on Kauai.  In partial fulfillment of this requirement, the qualifying contractor will be required to obtain office space in support of  facilities on both Maui and Kauai.  The goal of this effort is to establish a technology base for field demonstrations of advanced sensor systems suitable for ground-based, airborne, and space-borne missions, and technology development and demonstration at MSSS for imaging and remote target sensing and characterization.  Special interest will be shown to innovative technology approaches for high fidelity: remote acquisition, tracking, sensing, imaging, characterization, and differentiation of ground, airborne and space targets, especially small, dim, distant targets, or targets in low contrast environments; and laser beam control and fire control. These targets will be observed from ground and airborne platforms, in various combinations, with system designs making significant use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) elements.  Work will provide technical analysis and engineering support for R&D activities in technology areas such as: (1) Technology and systems development, prototyping and deployment of airborne and space borne laser radars for ranging, imaging, ground terrain imaging, chemical detection, surveillance, target acquisition, characterization and designation, communications and ancillary military applications, which could include an unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV’s) demonstration.  A key requirement for these systems is accurate beam control and fire control to maintain a high quality beam on the target consistent with mission requirements. System design must accommodate weight, volume, flight worthiness and power consumption constraints;  (2) Technology and systems development for a real-time, high-resolution tracking testbed laser radar system for acquisition, precision imaging, characterization and differentiation of space and ballistic objects. Imaging shall include the ability to perform coherent imaging and perform simultaneous range and velocity measurements for range Doppler imaging when applicable.  This includes systems development, analysis, field demonstrations and prototype deployment on the large aperture AEOS telescope and the Laser Beam Director (LBD) to serve as a state-of-the-art special R&D test facility. Initial demonstrations will be performed using the existing HI-CLASS laser radar, with a development path shown to a more capable system for 3d imaging, vibrometry, and polarimetry involving other laser types.  This testbed includes field demonstrations from the LBD down to the RMS site that emulate airborne sensing scenarios.  (3) Technology and component development of solid state and CO2 lasers, and sensors, to support development of systems described in (1) and (2) above.  For (1)-(3) above, work shall include  modeling and analysis, computer simulations, laboratory experimentation and demonstrations, mission and technology analysis,  prototyping systems and logistics for relevant USAF and DoD laser and laser radar missions. The NAICS code is 541710, size standard is 500 employees and this is an unrestricted acquisition. Foreign-owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer prior to any proposal submission.  This acquisition may involve technology and/or may require access to Militarily Critical Technical Data that is subject to Export Control laws and regulations.  Only offerors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) may submit proposals.  The offeror is required to submit a certified copy of the DD Form 2345 with proposals.  Contact the DLIS, 74 North Washington, Battle Creek, Michigan  49016-4312 (1-800-352-3572) for further information on certification and the approval process. All offerors are reminded that the new DoD final rule implementing the Central Contracting Registration (CCR) was published in the Federal Register, Volume 63, No. 61 on 31 Mar 98.  This rule requires contractors to be registered in the CCR as of 1 Jun 98 to be eligible to receive a contract award based on solicitations issued after 31 May 98 from any DoD activity.  Firms must register on a one-time basis and annually confirm accuracy and completeness of registration information.  Instructions for CCR can be accessed at http://www.ccr.gov/.    All respondents desiring a copy of the solicitation must provide a POC, an e-mail address, telephone number, fax number business size, and assigned Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code to the following address:  Det 8 AFRL/PKDB (Attn:  Lt.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Aircraft Division, intends to negotiate a sole source contract with John Hopkins University, Applied Physics Laboratory, 11100 John Hopkins Road, Laurel, MD 20723 for the procurement of Wrap Around Simulation Program (WASP) software.  This software will support real-time simulation of the Federal Aviation Agency Air surveillance Radar, other Government radars and the HDTV Sensor System, as well as the software for the display of this and previously supplied simulations for the Radar Surveillance and Assimilation Network (RSAN) hardware.  This computer software supports the hardware purchased from JHU/APL.  As the JHU/APL built the WASP, on which this simulation will be run, and have developed other simulations of these radars, they are uniquely qualified to develop the software required for RSAN.  RSAN is scheduled to be integrated with FAA radar by November 2004 and this is the only source, which can develop the simulations in time to meet that date.  The total estimated dollar amount for procurement of the software is $485,000 over a two-year period.  Note 22 Applies.

<DESC>I. INTRODUCTION.  The NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVAIR) is soliciting proposals for research and development (R&D) concepts for a sand and dust erosion resistant coating on the  Shaft Driven Compressor Impeller. Concepts proposed may represent novel dedicated technologies and/or dual use of new emerging commercial technology. 

II. BACKGROUND.  NAVAIR is working with sponsor agencies to advance the science and  technology of protective coatings for the Shaft Driven Compressor. This coating should not degrade the aerodynamic or strength characteristic of the impeller. The overall program objectives are:  (A) to explore new concepts/methods in impeller coating for the Shaft Driven Compressor Impeller; (B) invest in key technologies and create adaptations to better suit the needs of the war-fighting community.  The preponderance of awards have been in the area of one-to-ten million dollars; however, this does not preclude awards of a lower or higher dollar value.

III. SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST.   Proposals are being solicited in  the following area:

A.	New Operational Concepts protective coating for Shaft Driven Compressor Impeller.. Examples of the type of coatings that could be proposed are:  

1.	Coating that will significantly increase mission performance and operational capabilities.
2.	Coating that provides additional life necessary to meet mission-related life-cycle goals.  
3.	Coating that will not degrade the aerodynamic or strength characteristics of the impeller.  

IV. CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE.  NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or non-procurement agreements (e.g. Grants, Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions).  Other Transactions will be entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371, and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects.  Information concerning Other Transactions can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/other_trans.html and http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/research, or by contacting Becky Barnard at (301) 757-9761 or Tonecia Porter at 301-757-9735 or by e-mail rebecca.barnard@navy.mil or  tonecia.porter@navy.mil.  Final decision on acquisition type (contract/agreement) will be made by the government.  Offerors are advised that the Government is under no obligation.


NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project.  Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal).  In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act.

Specifically, the OIG DOD has a requirement to assess the reliability of Financial Management Systems used by DoD to develop agency financial statements and to assess the reliability of accounting information used by Department of Defense  (DoD) to develop agency financial statements.  The assessments will consist of Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) 70/88 Reviews and reliability assessments of key DoD Financial Management Systems.  The audits will consist of audit assessments and full scope financial audits of a component’s financial statement or a specific line item within the financial statements.  The work under this contract will be used to meet the OIG DoD requirement to audit the DoD financial statements and provide a basis for relying on the line items and disclosures that are significant to the financial statements.  The work will also assist DoD management in assessing the effectiveness of internal controls and compliance with laws and regulations.   The proposed three-year contract will include a base period of up to one year with up to two twelve-month options.  A minimum guarantee of $10,000 will be placed on each contract at the time of award.  An Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF), Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), and Time and Materials (T&M) task orders is anticipated.  Multiple awards are expected.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541211.  The scope of the contract will be divided into lots based on the size standard/small business certification.  Offerors will be allowed to bid on any and/or all sections of the contract for which they are eligible.  As part of their proposals, each offeror will indicate the lot(s) for which they are submitting their offers.  Offerors who are qualified 8(a) concerns may submit an offer for Lot I.  Qualified small business concerns can submit an offer for Lot II.  Lot III will be issued on an unrestricted basis.  It is anticipated this effort will be performed at various DoD installations throughout the world.    NAVAIR intends to release a draft solicitation via the Internet within 90 days.  The draft solicitation will be available on the NAVAIR Electronic Solicitation Website at https://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations as well as the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Defense website at https://www.dodig.osd.mil/audit/financial/financial.htm.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation and/or amendments.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.  NAVAIR AD intends to conduct an Industry Day/Pre-Solicitation Conference after the draft solicitation is released.  A future announcement will provide additional detail such as the exact time and location of the conference.

<SUBJECT>42--Spherical Aerial Ignition Device
<SOLNBR>NAR040077
<RESPDATE>061904
<ARCHDATE>05052005
<CONTACT>Beverly C Sechrest Contracting Officer 3032369441     Beverly_Sechrest@blm.gov;
<DESC>NAR040077 Spherical Aerial Ignition Device The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) at the National Business Center intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 using the Commercial Item procedures to acquire a minimum of 800 cases a year, for a potential five years, under an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, of spherical aerial ignition devices for the National Interagency Fire Center, BLM Boise, ID,  the BLM Alaska Fire Center, and other Federal Land Management field offices.  The Government believes the only responsible source that can satisfy these requirements is Aerostat Inc., 8703 Airport Blvd., Leesburg, FL  34788.  A justification for other than full and open competition has been prepared in support of this requirement.  The spherical aerial ignition device is a container 32 mm (1.25 in) in diameter containing approximately 3.0 grams of potassium permanganate.  The container is made from two hemispheres of high impact polystryrene that have been ultrasonically welded to form a permanent seal.  These spheres look similar to ping pong balls and are often referred to as such.  The spheres are packaged 1,000 each per case according to current shipping regulations and each case is labeled with the recommended percentage of ethylene glycol solution needed to obtain the desired time delay.  The spherical aerial device works in combination with the Premo MK III Aerial Ignition System (also a product of Aerostat Inc.).  The MK III launches the spheres from a helicopter.  Numerous Federal Land Management offices already have and are using this launching device.  The spheres are designed to move a bulk hopper down a feed chute into a slipper and valve block assembly where they are injected with ethylene glycol.  The sphere then moves to an ejection tube.  The rate of chemical reaction is dependent on the particular size and concentration of chemical involved.  The sphere is injected with the ethylene glycol (common antifreeze), combustion occurs within approximately 20 seconds.  Potassium Permanganate is an oxidizer and must be isolated from arsenic or antimony, glycerol, phosphorus, sulphur, sulphuric acid, hydrogen peroxide, aluminum carbide, titanium, hydrogen trisulphide and ethylene glycol during storage or shipping.  This acquisition, based on the minimum order quantity and for a five year period of performance, has as estimated value of $920,000.00.  No request for proposals (RFP) will be issued and no response will be made to letter or telephone requests for a copy of a solicitation.  This is not a request for competitive proposals, but serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  The NAICS Code is 325188.  Responsible firms are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice to the Contracting Officer.  They must, however, provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the requested items at a cost that will not exceed the total intended transaction cost.  All responses will be fully considered.  If no affirmative responses are received within 45 days of this posting, to the effect that a comparable source exists, a contract will be placed with Aerostat Inc. for the requirements stated herein.

<RESPDATE>062104
<ARCHDATE>05052005
<CONTACT>Elaine Flick Contracting Officer 3032363528     Elaine_Flick@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) intends to award a sole source contract to Westmor Industries, LLC, 3 Development Drive, Morris, MN 56267, for the production of an all wheel drive, 1,500-Gallon, in-field ground fuel service and maintenance support truck, the only known source capable of satisfying the agency's unique requirements, within the required timeframe.  A justification for other than full and open competition has been prepared and approved in support of this acquisition.  The BLM requires delivery of the truck during the 2004 Wildland Fire Season to be used in the support of prescribed and wildland fire suppression activities in 10 western states. The highly specialized vehicle chassis and package shall be designed for severe off-highway use and constructed to handle the rough unimproved road conditions found throughout the western states. The estimated price for the truck procured under this contract will be $169,000.00.  Time is critical, as unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements could adversely affect the National Interagency Fire Center's firefighting efforts.  Westmor is the only known source with the potential to manufacture and deliver the vehicle for use during the Summer 2004 fire season.  The manufacturer will construct a unit which meets or exceeds all requirements of NFPA 385 and DOT 406 and will provide any additional technical and structural engineering required for a fuel tender that is operated in conditions where road and environment place stresses many times greater than those found on primary and secondary roads.  The weight of the fully loaded truck shall not bear more than 90 percent of the GAWR for each axle. Detailed information on the specification is available upon request. This is not a request for competitive proposals.  This notice serves to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  This requirement is restricted as a 100% small business set-aside and NAICS code 336211, "Motor Vehicle Body Manufacturing" applies.  Responsible firms believing they can provide the required highly specialized off-road truck are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer referencing this Announcement number NAR040088.  However any firm identifying themselves as responsible must provide evidence that they can furnish the required vehicle at a cost that will not exceed the total estimated contract cost, and within a timeframe that will allow use of the vehicle during the Summer 2004 Wildland Fire Season.  All responses will be fully considered.  If no responses are received by June 21, 2004 to the effect that another responsible source exists, award will be made to Westmor Industries, LLC for the requirements stated herein.  Questions concerning this acquisition may be directed to Elaine E. Flick at (303) 236-3528, or emailed to elaine_flick@blm.gov.  See note 22!!

CONTRACT AWARD

The National Galley of Art will select a contractor whose response to this solicitation is the most advantageous in terms of the three evaluation criteria stated above.	


SECURITY

1.  Security Clearances

Security clearances are required for all contractor personnel working in the Gallery.   Immediately upon contract award, the contractor is to submit to the COTR the documentation for requests for security clearances for contractor personnel proposed to work on the contract.  The Gallery’s security office will perform a background security check on each proposed worker.  Because of the mission of the Gallery, and the potential for risk in permitting access to secured areas, there is no guarantee that a security clearance will be issued to any proposed employee.  The Gallery reserves the right to deny access to the Gallery areas during times when the Gallery is closed, and to deny access to non-public areas.   

1.1.  Documentation for Requests for Security Clearances

1.1.1  The request package must include the following completed documents, for each proposed employee.

The National Gallery of Art Authorization for Release of Information

The National Gallery of Art Contractor ID Request Form

(Copies of the blank documents follow this section.)

A clear photocopy of proposed employee’s driver’s license must be included in the package.  

1.1.2  The request package for permanent badges must include the following.

Optional Form 306-0182 Declaration for Federal Employment

The contractor shall submit request packages for all employees expected to work on site at the Gallery.  Obtaining security clearances is costly.  Therefore, the Gallery will not accept packages of requests that appear to be the contractor’s company roster.  Every effort will be made to complete security clearance checks quickly, however, the contractor shall plan for a seven work day processing period, for both initial requests and subsequent requests.  

The security staff will notify the COTR of the results of the security clearance check.  The COTR will immediately notify the contractor of the results.   In the event a proposed employee in not cleared for work at the Gallery, the contractor shall immediately – and within three work days, submit a request package for a substitute employee.  



1.2.  Badges

The Gallery issues two types of badges to contractor employees:  Permanent (“hard”) badges and temporary (paper) badges.  Each type has certain responsibilities and privileges.  It is completely at the Gallery’s discretion as to which type of badge is issued to contractors’ employees.   Each employee must wear the badge is a visible manner at all times when on Gallery property.  

Security Clauses (Continued)

All contractor employees who are issued temporary must sign-in and sign-out with the Gallery’s security staff, each time they enter/exit the Gallery.   Employees who have been issued permanent badges must scan the badge at each entry and exit.  
 
The permanent badge permits unaccompanied access to most Gallery areas.   The permanent badge is issued for a stated period of time, and is held by the employee until the expiration date or the time when the Gallery requests return.   

The temporary badge is issued on a daily basis and must be returned the security staff when exiting the Gallery.  Employees with temporary badges must be escorted when in the Gallery while the Gallery is closed to the public and when in non-public areas.  

The COTR will provide precise direction about Gallery access, at time of contract award. 

The contractor is responsible for immediately report any lost or misplaced badges to the COTR and the security staff.   The contractor is responsible for immediately returning any badges that where issued to employees who are no longer working on the contract.    

1.3  Access Hours

Generally, contractors will be permitted entry to the Gallery during the hours of 6:00AM and 6:00PM, Monday through Friday.  However, if a contract or task order requires different hours, those hours will be stated in the contract or task order.  

Work outside the normal contractor work hours or the hours required in a particular contract require prior COTR approval.  The contractor shall submit requests for different work hours to the COTR at least three business days before proposed change.  

Providing escorts for contractor employees is costly.  In order to contain costs, the contractor is responsible to notify the COTR if any employees will be arriving later than scheduled.  If the COTR is not available at the time of notification, the contractor shall notify the security staff of the proposed late arrival.  
   
1.4.   The designated point of entry to, and exit from, the Gallery, for contractor staff, is the West Building Service Entrance.   The Service Entrance is on Constitution Avenue, south of the Mellon Fountain and east of the Gallery’s 6th Street entrance.

NIAID studies focus primarily on viruses that play an important role in disease of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, the liver, and the reticuloendothelial system. Currently, NIAID employs the techniques of viral genetics and molecular biology to express protective viral antigens and attenuate viral mutants that may prove useful for prevention of disease. A number of promising live attenuated viral vaccines and virus-specific immunotherapies are under development and evaluation.  NIAID conducts research directed toward defining the cause and epidemiology of medically important viral diseases and developing means for their control. NIAID engages in a wide range of research activities that extends from identification and antigenic characterization of viruses that cause systemic disease or acute disease of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and the liver to basic molecular studies of viral structure, function, and genome organization. Scientists in the laboratory employ molecular biologic techniques to elucidate pathogenesis of disease as well as to develop purified subunit antigens and attenuated viral mutants for use in prevention of respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and systemic viral diseases.  The objective of this particular study is to use recombinant cDNA technology to generate a vaccine candidate effective against dengue virus types 1, 2, 3, and 4. The secondary objective is to develop a better understanding of the genetic basis of attenuation of dengue viruses for primates and mosquitoes.

The Contractor verifies that billed services are consistent with the patient’s condition and authorized treatment plan, categorizes these services under the appropriate Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) or procedure code, calculates payments based on Medicare methodologies, identifies unnecessary costs and inappropriate patterns of care, and pays claims accordingly.  The Contractor must also have the capability to apply the new Medicare Ambulatory Patient Group payment methodology.
A Cost-Reimbursement Contract will be awarded to Blue Cross and Blue Shied with a base year and four 12-month option years. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement through submission of capability statements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

The delivery for this acquisition will be on an FOB Destination basis.  The proposed procurement contains an option to extend the contract period one or more times at the discretion of the government.  The total duration (base plus option years) shall not exceed 5 years.  While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.   This solicitation will be issued as an unrestricted solicitation with other than full and open competition.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>C--Architect-Engineer Services, FY05 MCA Drum Road Upgrade, Helemano to Kahuku, Island of Oahu, Hawaii. 1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: Architect-Engineer services, procured in accordance with PL 92-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and FAR Part 36, are required for the design of FY05 MCA Drum Road Upgrade, Helemano to Kahuku, Island of Oahu, Hawaii. This announcement is open t o all businesses regardless of size. A firm-fixed price contract will be negotiated. Award of the contract is anticipated to be in October 2004. The selected firm, if large business, must comply with FAR 52-219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontract ing plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The subcontracting goals for this contract are that a minimum of 58% of the contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with small business (SB), which includes small disadvantaged busines ses (SDB), WOSB, HUBZone SB, Veteran-Owned SB, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned SB. The subcontracting plan is not required with this submittal, but the successful large business firm must submit an acceptable plan before any award can be made. 2. PROJECT INFORMATION: The project is to design improvements for an existing dirt, coral, and gravel road by realigning, widening, and repaving approximately 37.8 kilometers of roadway from the end of the paved road at Helemano Military Reservation to the  end of the existing paved road at Kahuku Training Area (KTA) for the purpose of providing the Army with uninterrupted vehicular access to the Kawailoa Training Area and KTA. The existing Drum Road is approximately 3 to 6 meters in width with no shoulders and runs through a series of mountains, gulches, and unimproved streambeds. The roadway lacks proper drainage and safety measures. Existing bridges, culverts, drainage pipes, and ford crossings allow surface runoff to cross the roadway. The roadway contain s blind curves and/or limited sight distances, steep slopes, tight turning radii, lack of safety rails at drop offs, and narrow widths at various locations. Project is to upgrade the existing road to an all weathered asphalt concrete pavement with two lane s, compacted gravel shoulders, drainage corrections, erosion controls, and safety measures. Project estimated construction cost is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000. Environmental assessment and natural resources surveys are being conducted under separa te contracts. 3. SELECTION CRITERIA: See Note 24 for general selection process. The PRIMARY selection criteria listed in descending order of importance are (first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion): (a) Specialized Experience of the firm in the design of  roadway projects with similar scope and magnitude. (1) The evaluation will consider the offeror's specialized experience in roadway design, including drainage, grading, hydrology, hydraulics, rock fall hazards, surveying, bridges, and geotechnical enginee ring.

(2) The evaluation will consider past experience from sources other than ACASS if submitted in response to this announcement. In evaluation of both these sub-criteria, the relevancy of each performance evaluation  to the proposed contract including the type of work, contract value, performing office, and recentness of general trends will be considered. (d) Capacity of the firm to accomplish work in the required time and in the prescribed manner. (1) The evaluation will consider the offeror's experience with similarly sized projects.

For the program 2004, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB) Program will be chemically treating thousands of exposed ALB host trees in designated areas in New York and Chicago.  APHIS intends on using pressurized delivery systems to inject specified volumes of Imicide (10% imidacloprid, manufactured and distributed by the J.J.

APHIS will issue the revised specifications for testing and evaluating the vendor's presurized delivery system approximately on or about January 8, 2003.  To download a copy of the specifications, the website address is http:///www.aphis.usda.gov/mpls/contracts/cbd.hmtl.  Deadline for submission of two complete systems with instructions or training manuals must be submitted no later than 4:00 p.m. EST on January 21, 2004.  Testing and evaluation will begin approximately on or about January 27, 2004.  Qualified injector systems will be identified on or about February 9, 2004.

<DESC>Introduction: Air Force Research Laboratory, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate (AFRL/ML), reannounces the award of the Core Metals Affordability Initiative (“Core MAI”), Agreement Number F33615-99-2-5215. This Initiative is a joint effort of the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Materials and Manufacturing Directorate and a Consortium made up of raw material producers, component suppliers, designers, assemblers, and original equipment manufacturers, currently: The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, Brush-Wellman, Carpenter Technology Corporation, Dynamet, Honeywell Incorporated, Ladish Co. Inc., Howmet Corporation, ALLVAC, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, PCC Structurals Inc., Rolls-Royce Allison, General Electric Aircraft Engines, Special Metals Corporation, Titanium Metals Corporation, and Pratt & Whitney. 

Presently Pratt & Whitney is the fiduciary agent or lead company (“Recipient”) for the Consortium and staffs a Program Office to support the Consortium.  It is noted that as a Cooperative Agreement this Award is not subject to the requirements of the Federal Acquisitions Regulations (“FAR”). The Cooperative Agreement and its attached documents, and the Collaboration Agreement included all documents and procedures referenced herein may be obtained by contacting the MAI Program Office (Not from the POC listed above.) (Please see all the corresponding names, postal and electronic addresses, telephone and facsimile numbers as set forth in the documents that have been made available electronically at the addresses indicated herein.) 

The Core MAI Initiative is structured to facilitate the conduct of projects based upon the submittal and selection of White Papers setting forth projects that will further the goals stated herein.  The Materials Affordability Initiative Consortium (MAIC), in conjunction with AFRL/ML, is interested in receiving proposals (“White Papers”) on the technical efforts (“Projects”) described below. White Papers in response to this announcement shall be sent to the MAI Program Office at Pratt & Whitney (See Section F of this document for the Points of Contact and corresponding addresses) for receipt on or before 1500 Hours local (East Hartford) time 45 calendar days from the date of this announcement, if the offeror wishes to have his/her White Paper considered for funding at the expected Technical Oversight Committee (“TOC”) meeting to be held on or before May 5th 2004. Offerors, who wish to submit White Papers later than 45 calendar days from the date of this announcement, can do so, 4 (four) months prior to the proposed start date of the project (with no end date of a project proposed to go past the completion date of the Core MAI Cooperative Agreement which is currently September 30, 2007).  However, because of uncertainty of funding approval cycles it is not known when the TOC committee will again meet to review and evaluate White Papers.  

No other solicitation is anticipated in regard to this requirement; but you are advised to monitor the Wright Research Site Contracting Office Web Site: http://www.wrs.afrl.af.mil/contract/.
You are further advised to continue to monitor the CBD and FedBizOpps (Federal Business Opportunities Web Site (http://www.eps.gov/) for adjustments and updates, including possible changes in the performance period for which White Papers Projects may apply.

Potential submitters are put on notice that if an offeror is not a consortium member at the time its White Paper is submitted, it must be designated by the Air Force as a consortium member in accordance with the Government's established and objective criteria and procedures and must sign the Collaboration Agreement between the consortium members, or team with a Consortium Member before its White Paper may be evaluated for funding in accordance with the process described in the Proposal Evaluation Process (PEP) document.  New consortium members will participate with existing consortium members on the Technical Oversight Committee ("TOC") in the evaluation and scoring of White Papers as described in the PEP.  All White Papers received in response to the solicitation will be submitted to the MAI Program Office which, in turn (and, if the offeror is not currently a member of the Consortium, after (1) notification by the Air Force that the offeror has been admitted as a new Consortium Member under the relevant objective criteria and (2) the offeror has signed the Collaboration agreement), will forward copies to each member of the Technical Oversight Committee ("TOC") at least three (3) weeks prior to the collective TOC evaluation .

Detailed requirements, instructions, attachments and additional information that will aid in the preparation of white papers for "Core MAI' can be found at the Wright Research Site Contracting Office Home Page  'http://www.wrs.afrl.af.mil/contract/' and/or at "EPS" (the Electronic Posting System 'http://www.eps.gov').

<SOLNBR>SP0200-04-R-5006
<CONTACT>Eileen Motta, Contract Specialist, Phone 215-737-7243, Fax 215-737-8139, Email Eileen.Motta@dla.mil
<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) intends to enter into a long-term Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract to support the worldwide demand for Abbott Immunoassay, Hematology, I-STAT and Medisense Diagnostic Reagents.  Through Market Research it has been determined that Abbott diagnostic reagents are specifically configured to support Abbott’s testing systems employed at the Military Treatment Facilities. No other manufacturer or distributors sells or has access to these products manufactured by Abbott Laboratories.  It has been determined that there is only one known manufacturer, Abbott Laboratories, who has the capability of providing the required items.
This solicitation will require Abbott to submit a catalog detailing all of the diagnostic reagents for each Military Treatment Facility serviced.  All prices for Immunoassay and Hematology reagents must be developed based on the Cost-Per-Test pricing methodology.  Under the Cost- Per-Test pricing methodology Abbott provides the testing equipment to the individual Military Treatment Facilities at no cost to the government.  A “usage fee” to use the equipment is amortized over the reagents that are used on that equipment for a period of 5 years, which is consistent with commercial practice.  Abbott will be asked to provide tables detailing the reagents, add-on options and any additional discounts.  The prices in these tables will be firm-fixed for the duration of the contract.  Abbott, will be required to supply all supporting price documentation (i.e. equipment model, number of machines, equipment service hours, retraining options and the number of cycles per day per patient for Hematology items and the total test for Immunoassay items) needed to perform the Cost-Per-Test calculation and a catalog with an inclusive price for each Military Treatment Facility serviced.  The price for Hematology and Immunoassay reagents may be adjusted annually for those customers who did not meet the previous years annual committed usage volume or who have a change in the amount of equipment or service hours currently rendered.  All increases in catalog prices charged to each customer will be recalculated using the firm-fixed price tables (e.g. reagent, add-on and discount) and the Cost-Per-Test pricing calculation outlined in the Abbott Federal Supply Schedule.  A price decrease can occur any time throughout the life of the contract.

I-STAT reagents are purchased based on quantity tier pricing.  Any customers whose usage falls within one of these quantity tiers will receive the same price for that reagent.  Under this solicitation Abbott will be required to provide a table detailing the I-STAT product line and the tier pricing offered.  They will also be required to submit usage data and a total ECAT price for each customer.  The pricing tables should support the price charged to each customer.  These tables will not be subject to adjustment and shall be firm-fixed for the entire duration of the contract, unless something becomes obsolete and a replacement item is added. The price for I-STAT reagents may be adjusted annually for those customers who have a change in their annual committed usage volume.   A price decrease can occur any time throughout the life of the contract.   
For the Medisense items the contractor shall submit an ECAT price for each facility serviced as part of their catalog.  These prices are firm fixed and are not subject to price adjustments during the life of this contract.
This procurement applies to Government facilities worldwide.  Initially, manufacturer’s will be asked to supply Continental United States (CONUS) catalog, which includes facilities located in the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia as well as Alaska and Hawaii and will be implemented first.  The Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) catalog will include facilities located outside the continental United States and will be required in the future.  The prices submitted by Abbott for each Military Treatment Facility serviced will be loaded into the DSCP Medical Electronic Catalog (ECAT).  The catalog must reflect a total delivered price.  Total delivered price is defined as the total cost of an item inclusive of transportation and distribution costs.
All Purchase Order, Purchase Order Confirmation and Invoice transactions under this contract are required to be electronic.  The contractor is required to use ECAT to electronically receive 850-Purchase Orders, transmit 997-Functional Acknowledgement’s, send 855-Order Confirmation’s, and transmit 810-Invoice’s for payment.  There are (3) three communication option available for ECAT; Web Supplier Interface, American National Standard Institute (ANSI) X 12 EDI Standard and the Global Healthcare Exchange (GHX).  Abbott Laboratories must have the capability of using at least one of these eCommerce communication options. They will be required to successfully complete system testing prior to receiving an award under this solicitation.
The contract resultant from this solicitation will have a one (1) year base period with four (4) one-year unilateral option periods.  This procurement has an estimated dollar value of $12.5 million dollars over the total contract period.  Solicitation SP0200-04-R-5006 is expected to become available May 31,2004 and can be found on the DLA Procurement Gateway at http://progate.daps.mil/home . 
Number Note 22 applies to this procurement.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  The U.S. Government Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB), Office of Contracts (M/CON) is conducting a market survey to determine the existence of sources to meet an anticipated multi-year BBG requirement for a range of FM broadcast transmission systems for deployment worldwide. The Government contemplates awarding one or more firm-fixed price (FFP) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) with each having  one (1) Base Year period with  four (4) 1-year options to extend the contract term. The  IDIQ contract(s) will have an annual minimum dollar guarantee of $50,000 for the Base Year and each exercised Option Year, with  a cumulative not-to-exceed (NTE) maximum dollar amount of $10.0 million  that includes all issued delivery orders. It is projected that multiple orders of transmission systems will be made over the duration of the  contract which includes the base and option years with the majority of orders issued near the end or the beginning of the Government's Fiscal Year.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) hereby issues a Request for Information (RFI) to identify sources with innovative and cost effective solutions to satisfy Defense Information System Network (DISN) Access Transport Services (DATS) requirements.  The DATS procurement is designed to acquire bandwidth to support DISN Next Generation (DNG) requirements, other DoD requirements, and Federal Agency requirements in the Contiguous United States. DATS will provide leased access transmission services between the Government-owned backbone network and customer locations.  The transmission services requirements will be required to support bandwidths from sub-DS0 through OC-192 and OC-192(c).  

This announcement is an RFI only, and not a Request for Proposal (RFP).   This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in responses. When there is further development in the project, a formal RFP will be issued.

This RFI is an opportunity for interested parties able to provide the required services to describe their capabilities and recommendations to fulfill the requirements. Responses should be not more than ten (10) pages in length. 

Interested parties should consider the following factors in development of their responses:

1.	The DISN Transmission Services CONUS (DTS-C) Contract with AT&T and the DISN Switched/Bandwidth Manager Services CONUS (DS/BMS-C) Contract with MCI are expiring over the next two years.  These two contracts currently provide a large portion of the switching infrastructure and transmission services for the existing DISN in CONUS.  The DISN CONUS Extension contracts (DTS-CE) are also used for DISN transport service, primarily for sub-T1 or short-haul circuits and will expire in approximately 5 years.  

2.	It is anticipated that the DATS will provide services similar to those currently being provided by the DTS-C and DTS-CE contracts. 

3.	“Last-Half Mile,” Base/Post/Camp/Station Inside Wire, Facilities issues and other Access issues have been on-going challenges for DISA in meeting the telecommunications requirements of its DOD Customers

4.	Vendor accountability as it relates to circuit restoration is absolutely critical to guaranteeing overall network availability. The vendor must have a real-time capability to monitor and manage transmission facilities 24x7 to ensure that services are delivered in accordance with DISA requirements.  Capabilities and plans for providing customer network management, peering partner relationships or customer-carrier electronic bonding through web services for on-line service activation, inventory, alarm notification, trouble management and performance monitoring are of special interest to the Government.

5.	There will be an existing High Bandwidth Backbone that must be integrated with services acquired under DATS and, potentially, other contractual actions that may follow.  The DATS will be used to connect users to that network and to other users within CONUS.  Vendor provided circuits will be terminated at commercial demarcs and extended by either the Government or the vendor to terminate on government-owned equipment

6.	The Government desires to provision a variety of transmission services across OC-N trunks using Multiple Service Provisioning Platforms (MSPP’s).  Clear channel service with virtual concatenation is desired so that DISA may control and rapidly reconfigure leased bandwidth with minimum intervention by the vendor.

7.	Over 9,000 circuit actions are anticipated during the transition from services provided by the DTS-C and DTS-CE contracts.  The DTS-C transition (approximately 7,000 circuits) must be completed as quickly as possible.  Industry strategies to meet an aggressive transition timeline are another issue of great interest. The Government is considering offering contractual incentives for accelerated service delivery during this transition and is interested in recommendations on how best to accomplish this.  

8.	During the sustainment phase, the Government is interested in strategies, including incentives and remedies, to encourage service delivery times in the 45-90 day range.  Strategies should also address ways to streamline the vendor’s service order process and other possible partnerships between DISA and industry to reduce delivery times.


9.	The Government is also considering using this contract to provide CONUS to OCONUS connectivity and is interested in comments on this subject.


Respondents are requested to address how they would accommodate DISA’s requirements and identify any limitations or other restrictions they foresee.

Interested parties responding to this RFI are invited to prepare a white paper addressing the above issues NLT May 24, 2004. Small Businesses are especially encouraged to respond.  All comments and suggestions are welcome. 

In addition, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) will host an Industry Day on Monday, May 10, 2004.  The purpose of this unclassified conference is to clarify, amplify and answer industry questions relative to this RFI and to explain DISA’s current DISN perspective and, more specifically, the acquisition strategy for DATS requirements. Industry Day information is posted under Contracting Opportunities, on the DITCO web site at http://www.ditco.disa.mil/. 
   
The point of contact (POC) is Mr. Randall Shirley, DNG Program Management Office, shirleyr@ncr.disa.mil, (703) 681-1214.  The POC for contractual issues is Ms. Judith Titus, Contracting Officer, titusj@scott.disa.mil, (618) 229-9539.

Responses to this RFI are to be sent to the contracting office at DISA/DITCO/PL8221, 2300 East Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5406, Attn: Ms. Judith Titus, and should include an original and five (5) copies plus either two (2) CD/ROM using MS Word 7.0 or compatible format, or sent electronically to titusj@scott.disa.mil email address. Email attachments must be virus free, and there must be a positive statement included in the email text to this effect.  Respondents must include the Company Name, Street Address, City, State, NINE-digit zip code, POC, POC telephone and facsimile numbers and email address, Company size and Status.  If the Company address includes a post office box, the complete street address must also be provided.  Proprietary information should be identified as such.  Respondents shall classify their company size using NAICS 517110, Wired Telecommunications Networks – 1,500 employees, as either a Small Business or Large Business.

<DESC>The future of nuclear medicine depends on long term, uninterrupted availability of research isotopes on a routine and continuous basis at a reasonable cost.  The National Cancer Institute (NCI) on behalf of the National Institutes of Health is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources of supply for research isotopes or radionuclides.  Possible sources of supply include national laboratories, commercial sources, foreign sources and university sources.

NIH estimates using the following types and quantities of isotopes through 2009:  

Amounts in Use / Projected Potential Use

         2004	    2005   2006	    2007    2008    2009
177Lu	100 mCi	    1525  3,025	   10,025   50,025  100,025

225Ac	500 mCi	    600   700(>1500)900(>1500) 1,700(>1500)6,000(>1500)1

124I	175 mCi	200		250		350		350		350

86Y 	50 mCi		50		50		50		50		50

67Cu	20 mCi		1500002	150000		150000		150000		150000


1 The 213Bi trial(s) potentially could reach a multi-center stage and would require >1500 mCi of 225Ac ($1,700,000) per year.  This is in addition to the projected amounts listed in the table.  This does not take into account the possibility/probability of other possible clinical trails and additional amounts should be considered possible.

2 The amounts of 67Cu are based on the performance of two clinical trials for treating NHL with BMT support.  This does not take into account the possibility/probability of other possible clinical trails and additional amounts should be considered possible.


Please provide technical information to support your capability to supply isotopes by the type and at the quantities estimated.  Responses should include the following:  (1) name and address of firm, (2) type of business, source, and country of origin (3) points of contact – name, title, phone, fax and e-mail, (4) experience and capability for producing isotopes (specifications of produced isotopes (those above) and projected specifications), (5) list of customers.  Responses should be submitted via mail to the point of contact address below by June 16, 2004.  E- mail responses can be submitted via e-mail to the Point of Contact, Elsa B. Carlton, ec39g@nih.gov.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a bureau operating within the Department of Commerce, is interested in identifying venders capable of providing short-term, project specific scientific and technical support.  During government fiscal year 2003, NOAA’s headquarters acquisition office acquired over $92 million worth of supplies and services to support the mission of the Ocean Service, Marine Fisheries Service, and Research Office.  Approximately 70% of the 1,200 transactions issued in 2003 were simplified acquisitions for services and supplies that directly support NOAA programs.  A portion of these simplified acquisitions were individual agreements for short-term (i.e., 6-12 months) technical and scientific services that required specialized skills to address a diverse range of issues associated with NOAA’s mission.  The type of services acquired include scientific data collection and analysis, creating, reviewing and revising scientific and technical plans and reports, reviewing program plans, procedures and results for compliance with pre-stated goals, building and sustaining coalitions among scientific and technical experts, and coordinating actions among Federal, state and local governments as well as industry and citizen groups.  The majority of these services require individuals with broad technical and scientific knowledge as well as detailed knowledge of NOAA’s mission, objectives and line office operating plans.  The following is a partial list of the types of labor that have previously been sought to work on short term projects:  physical oceanographer, coastal scientist, oceanographer, marine biologist, marine ecologist, environmental scientist, fishery biologist, and natural resource economist.   The level of experience can vary from junior level (graduate students) to principals and senior scientists.  NOAA’s mission, line offices and program objectives can be reviewed on its webpage: www.noaa.gov. 

PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT:  In order to create a more efficient process for acquiring and managing the scientific and technical support services described above, NOAA is evaluating the benefits of awarding one or more IDIQ contracts, or delivery orders (issued against the GSA/FSS schedule).  NOAA is particularly interested in identifying one or more venders who are small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, service disabled veteran owned, or HUBZONE qualified.  The vender must be capable of providing the following types of support:

1.	Identify and retain persons with the most appropriate scientific and technical skills necessary to accomplish projects as defined by the programs and line offices identified above.  
2.	Proactively work with NOAA program and line office personnel to define projects using performance-based metrics that correspond with and advance program and administration goals.
3.	Proactively manage assigned personnel such that the projects are accomplished in accordance with the performance metrics.
4.	Provide monthly reports of performance progress including and a clear method for correlating each project’s costs to one or more program specific accounting lines.  This reporting should reflect an explanation of progress relative to all current work objectives, performance metrics, funding allowances (current obligations) and costs incurred to date.  It shall be presented in a format that is easily understood by both program and procurement/finance personnel, and document the value delivered for the costs incurred.  Since new work may be periodically added, monthly reports shall include an explanation of performance objectives, metrics, and prices necessary to accomplish the stated objective accompanied by documentation of price reasonableness in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

SUBMITTING A RESPONSE:  NOAA is specifically seeking venders that understand NOAA’s programs and mission such that they can proactively manage on-site labor, and can break down broad program needs into clearly defined performance objectives with metrics.  Accordingly, venders interested in this prospective action should demonstrate a working knowledge and fundamental understanding of NOAA’s program goals and objectives as well as its operating environment and constituents.  Prospective venders should also clearly demonstrate an understanding of performance based service contracts including defining performance objectives, managing the effort, and achieving measurable results. Specific examples of past performance in each of these areas are strongly encouraged as well as an illustration/explanation of how monthly progress will be reported.

Interested firms with capability to provide these services are invited to provide a written response to this request no later than 12:00 Noon (EST) in Silver Spring, Maryland on May 24, 2004.  The response shall be submitted electronically in MS Word to robert.ransom@noaa.gov and in paper version to Robert E. Ransom, Contracting Officer, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, 1305 East West Highway, Suite 7604, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910.

An original and four copies shall be submitted as well as the electronic version in MS Word.  A one page letter shall cover the response signed by an individual authorized to commit the firm.  The cover letter is the first of ten pages.  The electronic version shall be in the form of an email with one attachment.  That single attachment shall contain all content and shall be sized less than five megabytes.  The Government will not be liable for any costs incurred in response to this request.  Each response shall be on 8-1/2 x 11-inch paper, in a commercially standard font, not smaller than size 10 (excluding separately created artifacts included within the text).  The response shall be secured by simple stapling with the cover letter as the first page and shall not contain any elaborate binding.  Each page in the response shall be separately numbered in Arabic numerals.  A page of paper printed on both sides is considered as two pages (if using double-sided pages, the front side would be page 1, the reverse side would be page 2). The response shall not include brochures, newsletters, or other marketing materials uniquely created for this procurement.  Elaborate artwork and expensive paper, bindings, visual or other presentation aids are discouraged.

EVALUATION OF RESPONSES:  Responses to this announcement will be evaluated relative to the above stated factors.  Venders that demonstrate the most effective combination of knowledge and skills relative to the above factors will be invited to submit competitive offers or, if appropriate, awarded a contract directly.  The responses to this Request for Information may form the basis for requesting a number of firms to provide briefings or submit quotations.  Questions and comments may be directed to the Contracting Officer by email only at robert.ransom@noaa.gov.  There will be no acknowledgement by the Government to responses to this Request for Information.  If a response generates further interest, you will be contacted.

The pricing mechanism that will be put forth in any subsequently issued award contemplates use of fully loaded labor rates, discounted based on volume, to be used as the basis for pricing individually defined performance-based assignments. Payment will be made upon inspection and acceptance at completion.  While no orders are guaranteed, it is contemplated that pricing will be discounted in a manner commensurate with the vender’s estimation of the potential volume of orders that may be placed.  For pricing purposes and, absent a more specific knowledge of potential ordering volume, vender may contemplate an annual order volume of $5.0 million.  The maximum duration of each agreement will not exceed 5 years.

<DESC>The M45 and M42A2 Mask Hose assemblies are life support items worn with the M45 Aviator and M42A2 Combat Vehicle Protective Gas Masks.  The hose assemblies allow the C2/C2A1 canister, which filters the air to the user, to be worn away from the mask f acepiece.   The hose assembly includes the hose and connectors at each end, a rubber gasket, and for the M45 version, a strap.  The hose assembly includes the ribbed hose itself, which is made of EPDM rubber and is approximately 24 inches in length and 1.2  inches in diameter.  At each end of the hose are molded nylon plastic threaded connectors that are secured to the hose via metal clamps.  Each attached clamp is subsequently covered/protected with a heat shrink polyolefin electrical insulation sleeve.   O ne end of the hose attaches via the female threaded connector to the canister.  The other male threaded connector end of the hose attaches to the sideport opening of the mask facepiece.  The hose component is required to pass leakage testing and the hose m aterial is required to pass first article agent permeation testing.   Both hose assemblies also require an EPDM rubber port gasket.  The M45 Mask Hose Assembly and the M42A2 Mask Hose Assembly are identical except for one sub-assembly.

<SUBJECT>51 -- Pressurized Injection/Delivery System
<DESC>For the program 2004, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB) Program will be chemically treating thousands of exposed ALB host trees in designated areas in New York and Chicago.  APHIS intends on using pressurized delivery systems to inject specified volumes of Imicide (10% imidacloprid, manufactured and distributed by the J.J. Mauget Company, Arcadia, California) into infested and at-risk trees during 2004 program year.  APHIS intends to approve pressurized delivery system(s) that offers the best value to the ALB Program.  Devices will be tested and evaluated on several general criteria as follow:  ease of use; ability to reliably and consistently deliver a known volume of pesticide to the test trees' xylem; sound construction; durability under heavy and harsh field use; compatibility with the USDA tip; minimal damage to integrity of the tree; protection of worker safety, prevention of pesticide exposure; protection of the environment, i.e., leakage prevention.  APHIS will issue the design specifications and the trial agreements outlining the terms and conditions for testing and evaluating the vendor's presurized delivery system approximately on or about December 15, 2003.  Deadline for submission of two complete systems with instructions or training manuals must be submitted no later than 4:00 p.m. EST on December 30, 2003.  Testing and evaluation will begin approximately on or about January 5, 2004.  Qualified injector systems will be identified on or about January 16, 2004.  To request a copy of the specifications and a trial agreement for evaluation of your pressurized delivery system, you must submit a written, email, or faxed request stating name, address, telephone number, and email to the Contract Specialist, Margie Thorson, at margie.p.thorson@aphis.usda.gov, fax at Area code (612) 370-2106, or address: USDA, APHIS, MRPBS, ASD; Contracting Team; Butler Square West, 5th Floor; 100 North Sixth Street; Minneapolis, MN  55403.

<SUBJECT>R -- Medical Record
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a firmed fixed price purchase order to Helen Ellis Memorial Hospital, located in Tarpon Spring, FL.  The purchase order is for the purpose of position of housing medical records for hundreds of former workers concentrated in the Tarpon Springs, FL area.  The availability and use of medical records would greatly improve examining physician’s interpretative ability for individual’s tests results. Therefore, the clinical quality and validity of the medical screening at this hospital would be improved compared to if conducted elsewhere. Agency for Toxic Sustances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) will also be supporting the existing doctor-patient relationship at this hospital’s occupational services clinic. Also, the cost of this service will be reduced for ATSDR because of the elimination of local shipping of records, reproduction of materials, and local transportation. By not having to transport medical records among area hospitals or clinics, this eliminates the potential of lost medical records. In addition, a quality of service dilemma is eliminated, namely  refusal of the hospital to release medical records to other facilities because of legal concerns under Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) .  Helen Ellis Memorial Hospital’s occupational services clinicians/physicians will be able to provide input to ensure the appropriateness of proposed pulmonary tests. Hospitals in the Tampa area were considered for this medical evaluation; however, distance related factors and burden on participant and agency considerations indicate that these more distant facilities would significant adversely affect participation rate, data collection, and the quality of the data sets to be used by ATSDR for writing a final report.  The authority for this sole source procurement is FAR part 6.302-1 in that Helen Ellis Memorial Hosital, is the only known source with the knowledge required that can meet all of the program requirements including local standard of care, equipment , cost and time constraints.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  Firms that believe they can provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 10 days from the publication date of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries may be sent to Linda T. Robinson by email at ltr1@cdc.gov or by fax at 770-488-2668.

2 	Description
This is an announcement of the GSA streamlined competitions for Facilities Maintenance. GSA is conducting four streamlined competitions in accordance with OMB Circular A-76, dated May 29, 2003. This A-76 cost comparison study will examine the possibility of converting Government "in-house" operations to contractor operations. A cost comparison to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the following services and related functions performed by Government personnel to contract performance will be conducted. Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have the Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified.

The competition will include services that are currently performed at Government-owned or Government-leased facilities in Haines, AK, Spokane and Richland, WA, and Pocatello, ID. Services being competed include a variety of operation and maintenance, custodial, and grounds maintenance activities at the various buildings.  Approximately four Full Time Equivalent positions are affected by this competition.  Work assigned to these positions are covered by FAIR Act Function Code Z999.

The Competitive Sourcing Official for GSA studies is Carolyn Pendergrass.  Michael Okoro is the Agency Tender Official. The Contracting Officer is Susan Haas, and Susan.Hass@gsa.gov is the e-mail of record.

This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract. Prospective offerors are advised that a solicitation will not be issued if the cost of contract performance is determined to be greater than the cost of in-house performance by Government personnel. No solicitation exists at this time. The solicitation will be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities if and when it is released.    

The cost comparison will be completed by August 2, 2004. This synopsis is issued for informational purposes only. Should the cost comparison result in the Government In-House Cost Estimate being above the range of contract cost estimates, a solicitation will be issued on or about October 2,  2004 via the http://www.fedbizopps.gov website.

<SUBJECT>D -- JWID 2005 (formerly JWID)
<DESC>1. This Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) announcement is for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration 2005 (CWID 2005), formally known as the Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstration, scheduled for 31 May through 24 June 2005. The focus for CWID 2005 is on coalition interoperability, Homeland Defense (HLD), and Homeland Security (HLS). Combatant commands, Services and Department of Defense (DOD) Agencies (C/S/As), government agencies outside the DOD, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and national participants outside the United States must submit interoperability trial proposals for CWID 2005 by 15 September 2004. Industry partners must work through a C/S/A or government agency sponsor from outside the DOD to submit trials. Complete details on CWID 2005, to include the format and submission instructions for trials, can be found at http://www.jwid.js.mil. 
2. CWID is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's annual event that enables the US combatant commands and international community to investigate command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) solutions that focus on relevant and timely objectives for enhancing coalition interoperability.  US Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) on behalf of the Chairman is responsible for the oversight of CWID.  The intent is to conduct trials of C4ISR capabilities during CWID which can then be moved into operational use within 6-12 month following the execution period. Trials are not limited to evaluations of hardware or software solutions. The tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with using technology are just as important as the solutions themselves and further investigations into these areas using CWID as a vehicle are encouraged. The USJFCOM J86I Joint Interoperability and Integration (JI&I) Transformation Change Proposal (TCP) process will be the primary method used to responsibly field promising technologies to fit warfighter requirements in the 6-12 month timeframe. 
3. United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) is the host combatant command for CWID 2005. Consequently, the scenario for CWID 2005 will incorporate aspects of HLD and HLS in addition to traditional coalition operations. USNORTHCOM plans to include the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Coast Guard. USNORTHCOM intends to use CWID as a proving ground for emerging C4ISR technologies relevant to HLD and HLS. Coalition participation remains the cornerstone of CWID.  Anticipated international participants will include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and NATO to include several constituent nations. In addition, all combatant commanders may invite nations, with prior JFCOM approval, from within their respective area-of-responsibility to participate as multinational task force (MTF) members. 
4. CWID is conducted in a simulated operational environment to provide context for validation of C4ISR solutions. Depending on capabilities to be demonstrated during CWID Execution each trial may receive one or more of the following assessments based on the criteria set forth in the CWID 2005 additional information document:  Warfighter/Operator, Technical/Interoperability, and/or Security Capabilities assessment.  The Systems Engineering Integration Working Group (SEIWG) with input from other working groups will report on trials not formally assessed by the Assessment Working Group (AWG).   Results from all trials will be reported on in the CWID final report. Trials with coalition partners are conducted over a worldwide secure network enabling trials classified SECRET releasable to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and NATO. Use of other information domains over other networks to support participation of additional nations and the information flow required for the HLS/HLD portion of the scenario depends on which other nations and which U.S. government agencies participate. The CWID Joint Management Office (JMO) coordinates, engineers and supervises the network backbone(s), information domains and the worldwide venue, and provides the trial assessments. 
5. To be considered for participation in CWID 2005, each proposed trial must:  
a. Address one or more of the CWID 2005 objectives listed in paragraph 6.  
b. Commit to fully resource the trial (funding, personnel, training, hardware, software, documentation, etc.) for CWID 2005 at one or more CWID site. 
c. Industry partners must submit trials in concert with a DOD sponsor or with a government sponsor from outside the DOD. Trial proposals must be provided in a specific format as detailed on the CWID web site. 
The CWID Senior Management Group (SMG), in concert with the coalition partners, will select specific trial proposals for execution by 7 November 2004 given projected availability of resources, how well the trial dovetails with the objectives, and additional considerations as specified on the CWID web site in the supplemental guidance to the FBO. USNORTHCOM will provide an initial determination on those trials related to HLD/HLS. 
6. USJFCOM, in coordination with USNORTHCOM, gathered and prioritized objectives for CWID 2005 from the Unified Commands, NATO, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. A summary of the eight specific CWID 2005objectives follows.
CWID 2005 Overarching Objectives and Explanations
Overview:  
The term coalition has changed significantly since the events of 9/11.  The traditional thought of coalitions that included national military to military, now incorporate civilian agencies.  The Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) has highlighted the need for unimpeded information sharing between traditional coalition partners, and perhaps as significantly between DoD and non-DoD agencies.  The interagency requirements for information sharing are, in many cases, more complex than those of traditional military to military coalition partners because of a lack of common standards for both hardware and software.  
Coalition operations in response to international crises continue to highlight the requirement for coalitions to exchange C4ISR information seamlessly.  The acceptance and endorsement of the network centric warfare concept by the U.S. and the nations within the various coalitions participating in these operations, points to the need to resolve the technical, procedural and policy challenges that accompany this concept.  
The Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration (CWID) program remains the premier event for U.S. and Homeland Security/Homeland Defense (HLS/D) coalitions, and traditional international coalition participants to explore interoperability solutions.  The emphasis on technical assessments, military utility assessments, warfighter, and security evaluations of these solutions will lead to accelerated fielding by the U.S. to its warfighters and inter-agencies.  CWID also provides the proper framework to nominate technologies and trials for joint standards.  CWID 2005 offers a continuation of this successful venue to work through all aspects of the solution, focusing on network centricity, and accompanying needs to refine current procedures and policies or create new ones in support of technical advances.  
All hardware, software, or Tactics, Techniques or Procedures (TTPs) solutions to a CWID 2005 objective should support the overall network centric warfare and information centric concept.  During CWID planning and execution, trial activities may be run over, or connected to, the coalition wide area network either in support of military operations or military assistance to civil agencies.  All trials are run within the context of an overarching scenario to show how coalition warfighting and civil operations can benefit by using the technology, procedures, or policy changes, associated with the trial.
Objective 1:  
Improve command mission assurance planning and execution capabilities and procedures for Homeland Defense and Civil Support, by providing applications and innovative operational constructs (i.e., procedures, processes, concepts) that address integrated and technology-enabled planning across information assurance, continuity of operations, anti-terrorism/force protection and critical infrastructure protection.  (Mission Assurance)
Explanation:  Mission Assurance requirements are key to the success of overall Coalition, DoD, and civil authority Homeland Defense efforts.  Mission Assurance is defined to incorporate the areas of: Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP), Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP), Information Assurance (IA), Responsive Effective Logistics, and Continuity of Operations (COOP).   Software & hardware tools are required for coordinated planning within and across these areas.  A critical capability for these tools includes the requirement to monitor, assess and report threats and hazards affecting critical infrastructure vulnerabilities; plan to detect, deter and mitigate threats; and defend critical infrastructure throughout the Area of Responsibility.  Solutions must address the capability to automatically access and display actionable Homeland Defense and Civil Support information from multiple organizations, including military, DoD, and non-DoD agencies.   Information must be available to the user in multiple media (e.g., Web Portal, GIS enabled thin client, etc) regardless of information domain membership and must be capable of tailoring to priority user needs.  Solutions presented should address system integration and data conversion issues.
Objective 2:  
Provide an enhanced interoperable situation awareness capability, scalable in time, scope and bandwidth within and between information domains.  Inherent in this objective is the underlying, continuing need to fuse and distribute information.  (Situational Awareness)
Explanation:  Situational awareness is more then providing a common operational picture at the strategic or major echelon level of command.  Situational awareness must be able to be scaleable in scope and bandwidth for use at the theater, tactical, and unit levels.  Inherent in this requirement is the need to fuse dissimilar information and to extract specific data sets needed at the theater, tactical, unit levels.  
Trial proposals must use existing interface standards that define the format, content, and exchange mechanisms for shared data to the greatest extent possible.  Solutions must support each nation’s disclosure and release policy. Possible information to exchange would include friendly and hostile order of battle, targeting information, safe areas for marshalling, weather data, imagery, GIS map data, other intelligence information, etc.  Of particular interest to USNORTHCOM is the exchange of GIS and GCCS information with non-DOD, Federal, State and local participants via a protected network, common to all.  Information exchange should support planning and execution of operations.  At a higher level, this issue concerns effective information dissemination and knowledge management.  This includes problems of integration, translation, or conversion of data in one format to another; identification of producers and consumers of information; and how to transmit the information securely from end to end while supporting national disclosure/release policy.  A key subset to this situational awareness environment is that users must be able to securely access, extract and utilize information contained within dissimilar databases across multiple information domains, when operating with limited bandwidth. 
Objective 3:  
Provide solutions to facilitate information sharing across multiple information domains.  (Multi-Level/Multi-Domain Protection)
Explanation:  Information sharing requirements prompted by the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) are complex.  The complexity is increased by the need for civil agencies of one nation to interact with those of other nations in addition to traditional military to military coordination.  Coalitions inherently require separation of participants into various information domains.  Information domains are frequently equated to individual, separated networks or to electronically isolated enclaves (protected information exchange environments) within a given network. The information exchange between these participants must be accomplished in such a way that all participants establish a sense of trust that such sharing of information is required, will be disseminated securely, and will be only available to agreed upon and authorized participants.  Additionally, the integrity of sharing the information across networks must be preserved.  Traditional guarding technologies employed at information domain boundaries limit the advantages of network centric warfare where information dissemination is at a premium.  Potential trials need to explore web technology, improved data labeling, or enhancements to existing solutions while being realistically acceptable to security management concerns.  Where applicable data encryption must be accomplished at the lowest level.
Objective 4:  
Provide solutions and offer techniques and procedures that enable collaborative planning across a bandwidth constrained operational environment. (Collaborative Information Environment)
Explanation: Network centric warfare implies that coalition, DoD and civil authorities can harness the power of their information environment to collaboratively plan and execute operations even when bandwidth is constrained.  Collaborative planning in a bandwidth constrained environment across and within domains is an emerging issue for the warfighter particularly as software and procedure tools are now robust enough to be extended from the theater to tactical levels.  Existing tools such as Sametime and DCTS must be adapted to easily interoperate with each other.  Procedures must be established and validated by the warfighters to maximize the use of these tools.  
Objective 5:  
Provide solutions to permit enhanced sharing and dissemination of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) products within and across information domains.  (ISR Dissemination)
Explanation:  Operations require an information environment that spans multiple information domains.  These information domains may be populated and maintained by military or civil agencies or a combination of both and likely will be bandwidth constrained.  ISR products represent essential information exchange requirements (IER) between these information domains.  Solutions to achieve this movement of ISR products should consider use of existing approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations, or propose new approaches that are well on their way to gaining security certification for operational use.   
Objective 6:  
Provide solutions to address in-transit security of information being exchanged between fixed domains and mobile users.  (Wireless Security)
Explanation:  Within any information environment, there are users who must operate away from fixed information domains that span multiple locations.  These users and/or first responders require interoperable secure wireless approaches to receive and transmit critical voice, data, and video information to support the network centric warfare concept.  Solutions presented should be security accredited by national authorities or very close to accreditation. 
Objective 7:  
Provide improvements to language translation tools to allow grammatically correct, simultaneous multi-language translations to support verbal and textual collaboration.  (Language Translation)
Explanation:  Coalition operations may involve multiple nations and organizations that do not use a common language.  Tools to translate documents, displays, and written/audio-exchanges with planners and end-users, is a requirement of operations at the military, agency, and other government organization levels.  Current tools have limited vocabularies for limited languages and may not provide grammatically correct translations.  Additionally, no tool currently provides for the simultaneous translation of a single language to multiple languages.
Objective 8: 
Provide solutions for responsive effective logistics within and between multiple information domains.  (Integrated Logistics)
Explanation:  Within the information environment of a coalition operation, military and civil-agencies have requirements to provide responsive effective logistics.  Logistic data availability is contained within multiple logistic information systems maintained by the military and civilian agencies across the coalition.  Access to the data implies combining total asset visibility and information on transit of friendly forces into a single information presentation available across multiple information domains.  Solutions should address the locating and fusion of logistics information feeds into part of the commander’s general situation awareness.  Technologies such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) must be explored to ensure full support of integrated logistics.  All solutions to achieve this should consider use of existing approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations or propose new approaches that are relatively mature in gaining security certification for operational use.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair nd timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) Stennis Space Center, MS 39529 requires the deployment of one (1) 6 meter buoy and one (1) DART buoy in accordance with the following statement of work (SOW):  

1.0     PURPOSE
This SOW provides the contractor information necessary to prepare quotes to deploy one NDBC 6 meter buoy used for open ocean meteorological data and one DART buoy with Bottom Pressure Recorder (BPR) used for early detection of Tsunami’s.  The 6 meter buoy provides part of the National Weather Service forecast data, and is available for public use.  The (2.6 meter) DART buoy and BPR are used for Deep Ocean Assessment of Tsunami’s which will provide deep-ocean bottom pressure measurements in real time for early detection of tsunamis. This SOW provides specifics for deployment of weather buoy 6N16 at NOAA station 46002 and DART buoy 2.6D04 at station 46405 with recovery and deployment of BPR.  The contractor shall submit quotes on two options:  

Option #1 is to load the vessel at the US Coast Guard Station in Astoria , OR and upon completion of the mission, return to Astoria, OR to unload NDBC equipment and personnel.  

Option #2 is to load at the ships home port, and return to home port or a port chosen by the contractor that has facilities to off load all NDBC equipment and personnel.

2.0	PROJECT DETAILS
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) station 46002 is to be established at GPS coordinates 42 degrees 34 minutes 39 seconds N, 130 degrees 21 minutes 35 seconds W approximately 260 NM west (2660T) from Cape Blanco, CA, and 295 NM west /northwest (2960T) from Cape Mendocino, CA.  The buoy is a boat shaped aluminum buoy, with dimensions 20'x 8' x8', drawing 5' draft.  NOAA buoy 6N16 weighs approximately 16,000lbs.  The buoy’s mooring consists of three portions: upper, middle, and lower sections.  The upper mooring section is a six foot nylon insulator at the top, followed by a swivel, and then 90' of 1-1/2" open link chain.  The middle mooring section consists of 1000' of 1-3/4 inch nylon spliced into 4400' 1-1/8 inch nylon, spliced into 4,400' of 1-5/8 inch poly-pro line. The lower mooring section consists of 360' of 1-1/2 inch open link chain and 6000 lb anchor.

Deployment is scheduled to commence on or about June 01, 2004 and shall conclude with return to the designated port.  Once at deployment site, the ship shall deploy the buoy and mooring components.  The buoy can either be loaded on deck or towed by the mooring to the deployment site.  To tow by the mooring a hawser will be connected to the first 90 feet of chain and the buoy towed by the hawser.  After the buoy has been successfully deployed, the vessel is required to remain on station a minimum of three hours for system testing.

DART station 46405 is to be established at GPS coordinates 42 degrees 54 minutes 11 seconds N, 130 degrees 54 minutes 32 seconds W.  The buoy is a foam hull with stainless steel frame which is cylindrical in shape with a diameter of 103 inches and weighs 1350lbs.  The mooring consisting of upper mooring of 4 meters 1 inch long link chain, the middle mooring section consists of 330 meters of 1 inch nylon spliced into 425 meters  7/8 inch nylon, spliced into 550 meters of 3/4 inch nylon line. The lower mooring section consists of 5.5 meters 1" open link chain attached to eight each railcar wheels 6850lbs.

The user and/or system manager shall be able to customize counting and sample parameters such as count time, repeat counts, efficiencies, background subtraction levels, and data output formats; (23) Protocol programming shall support simple mathematical algebraic operations to convert data output to user specified values or units. These simple operations shall include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, log, and square root functions allowing background subtraction, efficiency and unit conversions, decay corrections, and statistical analysis; (24) Protocol specified output reports formats shall support units such as gross and net counts and count rates, disintegration rates as reported in disintegrations per minute, disintegrations per second, multiples of Becquerel (Bq, kBq, etc.) and multiples of Curies, (nCi, uCi, etc).  Outputs shall be capable of reporting at a minimum: Protocol Titles, Sample Identifications, User Identifications, Dates, Clock Time, Count Rates, Disintegration Rates, Sample Count Times, Minimal Detectable Activities, and Standard Deviations, and “Alarm” or “Contaminated” warnings. The “Alarm” or “Contaminated” warnings shall be based on user specified levels appropriately programmed for each protocol.  The protocol programming shall also allow for input specification of flow rates, deposition rates, or volumes for calculations when counting particulate air filters.    User customizable output report templates for hard copy print outs and electronic data files shall including space for comments, sample descriptions, and signature blocks.  Programming these templates shall be simple (preferably menu driven with on screen help) and full instructions shall be provided with the documentation; (25) Users shall have the option or ability to input a description, user name, or other pertinent input data such as sample descriptions that will be included in the reports at the beginning of a batch counting.  Should the user choose not to input that data before counting, the report formats shall be able to include blank lines to add the information to the file after the count and/or to hand write this information on the hard copy print out; (26) Real time on screen display of sample data, counting session results, system parameters, and specified analysis shall also be supported while the count is in progress.  For example when the 1st sample is completed the screen shall echo the calculated report results to the screen.  An update of the second count or count rate and count time will also be displayed either on the monitor or a separate display panel on the unit while the count is in progress.  When the second sample count is done the monitor shall display those calculated report results below the first sample results and shall proceed to the third sample, etc.  In this way the user shall be able to track the results for the batch while the counting is in progress; (27) Automatic hard copy report print outs for each batch of samples shall be available in all operating modes. For example it shall be possible to set the protocol for normal sample counting so that the report shall be printed automatically upon completion of the counts without requiring the user to return to the machine, select a file, then command a print.  The user shall be able to start the count, walk away, comeback later and take the printout off the printer tray; (28) Counting session results shall also be saved in memory so that the files can later be retrieved to generate an additional hard copy report output at a later time.   The software shall support saving the sample count results to an electronic media such as disks, CD RW, or other standard and supportable computer data transfer media.  The data files shall be retrievable, transferable, and editable as needed using common database or spread sheet software (This software shall also be supplied and loaded onto the computer).  The system shall provide a warning when the disk memory is nearing capacity to allow the users to remove files without loss of data; (29) Complete backup of all system parameters, data collection, and analysis results shall be an integral part of the program.   All operating parameters for each of the sample types (protocols) shall be stored and available for use at any time during counting of samples with sample type identified by a built-in designed method (such as protocol cards).  A function to back up and recall all system parameters, user created/defined controls, and output formats to removable media shall be provided; (30) The system shall be designed to automatically recover from any power interruption and continue operations without loss of operating parameters or completed count data; (31) Separate modes for alpha, beta, and alpha plus beta measurements shall be provided and be selectable from the sample protocol batch programs; (32) Quality assurance and Quality Control shall be integrated features of the software.  The software shall include automated routines for comprehensive calibration and quality assurance determination and adjustment of all sensitive parameters.  These will include voltage plateau, threshold, and window settings, detection efficiency, detector background count rates, alpha and beta channel spillover, and efficiency/background figure of merit or similar optimization measures. Quality control parameters (back ground, Chi-squared stability, long term alpha and beta source response stability, energy efficiency, alpha window cross over, and LLD or MDA) shall be monitored and trend plots generated automatically and/or at the users request.  Indications of statistical deviations from set parameters shall be identified by the QC software; (33) Submissions with regularly sold “Off the Shelf” and “Turn key” systems are preferred.  Prototype or first of a kind offerings are highly discouraged; (34) The vendor shall provide for delivery of the counter to NIST within three months of the award of the contract. Within two months of delivery the vendor shall provide support personnel to install the unit and train NIST Health Physics staff during the set-up, initial calibrations, and initial usage of the counter here at NIST.

The job will be complete upon successful demonstration of the system in each room to the TSB Branch Chief, Rick Hazzard.  The work shall include removing any unused cables not necessary for the operation of the new system configuration; it shall also include installation of new cable as required, new cable plugs, and other supplies necessary to ensure the system is fully functional.

The Government will provide a "template" of the touchpanel layout for the Panja to be used in each room to ensure consistency from room to room.  It is recommended that one room be completed and accepted as a prototype prior to beginning work on the remaining sixteen (16) rooms.

<DESC>Referencing FAR 6.302-1(b)(4) & (c), as well as subparts 8.4 & 12, Peace Corps intends to foster competition, albeit on a restricted basis by maintaining a uniform and standard operating environment, among GSA IT schedule 70 (standard item numbers 132 33 & 34) contractors.  FAR 12.211, Computer Software, is hereby incorporated by reference.  Peace Corps reminds offerors that FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Commercial Items, applies (see also FAR 12.206 Use of Past Performance, and FAR 15.304 Evaluation Factors and Significant Subfactors para (e)): The Basis for Award will be Best Value to the Govt; wherein, Technical Service Capability is “approximately equal to cost or price.” As evidence of the Technical Service Capability, vendors will be required to submit at least three (3) Past Performance references, detailing services of similar scope and term delivered to Federal or other business clients worldwide. There will be no limit to the length of these references and they will not count against a 50 page maximum Technical Proposal limit.  The following is the Past Performance evaluation checklist contemplated:  Customer; Contract/Project Title; Type of Agreement/Contract; Contact Name; $ Value; Performance Period; Program Mngr; Subcontractors; SOW Scope; SOW Deliverables; Complexity/Difficulty; Performance/Technical Objectives Achieved; Problem Area Resolution; Significant Accomplishments; Degree of Excellence/Award Fee or Rating (if applicable); Other Evaluation Factors: Quality of Service, Customer Satisfaction, Timeliness, Cost Control, Key Personnel, Project Mgmt.  Q1: Are the software items listed in Appendix A for tracking purposes only or will all of the items in Appendix A be purchased as part of this solicitation (e.g. Sybari Antigen for Exchange and Informed Filler)? A1: Only the items entitled “Anticipated Future Software” will be procured. This includes Antigen but not Informed Filler.  Q2: Does Peace Corps require Small Business Server 2003 Premium Device or User CALs? A2: Device CALs will be procured (see “Anticipated Future Software” in Appendix A).  
Q3: The solicitation refers to providing a “3-year maintenance contract, full upgrade support and volume licensing…”. Is Peace Corps expecting one 3-Year maintenance contract to cover all software products being purchased? Normally there are separate maintenance contracts offered by each software product manufacturer, thus multiple maintenance contracts would be provided as offered by each software manufacturer. A3: NO. Peace Corps realizes that each software package has its own rules for licensing. This is why Peace Corps has included the “analysis” component to the requirement. Vendors are required to provide 3 year maintenance agreements with the purchase; however, if this is not possible, a proposal for advice to Peace Corps as to other possible routes must be provided, including enterprise licensing.  Q4: A reference was initially made to a size standard similar to ASAP Software Express. Can Peace Corps be specific as to what size standard this equates to in terms of Gross annual Sales and/or number of employees? A4: The reference to ASAP Software Express was deleted in its entirety by amendment 1 to this solicitation. Please refer to the FAR 52.212-3 (Offer Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items (May 2004)) reference for NAICS code 423430 (SIC 5045) Computer and Computer Peripheral Equipment and Software Merchant Wholesalers – 500 employees (not to exceed) for Govt contracting.  Q5: Is ASAP Software Express the incumbent contractor? A5: ASAP Software is the software licensing subcontractor to Peace Corps’ Seat (outsourced IT services) contractor Northrop Grumman Commercial Information Services, Inc. of Herndon VA, who performed the initial overseas deployment (migration to Post).  Q6: Does ASAP Software Express provide any specific Technical Service Capabilities that are important to Peace Corps for this solicitation? A6: The Technical Services required are outlined in the Statement of Work (see 26 APR 2004 Combine Synopsis/Solicitation): assess Peace Corps Intl Tech Suppt Div needs, track PC CIO/OI/ITS assets, and procure software efficiently for Peace Corps as a collaborative partner. Peace Corps recognizes the unique nature of the services contemplated, which may be outside of the terms and conditions of GSA IT schedule 70 (SIN 132 33 & 34) contracts. Therefore, Peace Corps encourages teaming with and/or offers from international distributors, with experience delivering to Federal or other business clients worldwide.

6 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The Port of San Antonio and the Port of Valparaíso, with the support of the Ministry of Public Works and Transportation, have submitted requests for funding to conduct feasibility studies to plan the integration of intelligent transportation system (ITS) technologies and information communication technologies (ICT) to improve the productivity and overall competitiveness of the ports.  In addition to evaluating these two projects, the DM Contractor will be tasked with identifying and evaluating at least one additional prospective project for USTDA funding consideration, targeting the private ports and privately operated port terminals.

Chile has a market-oriented economy characterized by a high level of international trade.  Chile has diversified trading links with North and South America, Europe and Asia.  The U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect in January 2004, is part of Chile’s diversified trade strategy, which includes FTAs with Canada, Mexico, the European Union, and Mercosur, for example.  In 2002, the state ports in Chile moved 13 million tons of containerized cargo, or 795,538 containers, of which 52% was imports, 30% exports and the balance cabotage and in-transit.

Chile has ten public ports and 27 private ports.  Private, dedicated purpose ports account for approximately 60 percent of the tonnage shipped.  Of the 58 million tons moved by Chilean ports, about 40% is handled by the traditional public ports of San Antonio, Valparaiso, San Vicente, Antofagasta, Mejillones, Iquique, Arica, Puerto Montt and Punta Arenas.  Until 1997, the public ports were managed by the Port Company of Chile (EMPORCHI, Empresa Portuaria de Chile) under the Ministry of Transport.  At that time, a new ports law (Ley No. 19.542) decentralized EMPORCHI and established the framework by which the respective port authorities (Empresas Portuarias) could concession various port operations (terminals, harbor maintenance and dredging, access roadways) to private operators.  The balance of maritime trade is handled by private terminals operated by large private companies in the mining and other industrial sectors.  For example, in 2002 the Huasco Terminal operated by the Compania Minera del Pacific moved 5.21 million tons of freight, primarily steel and raw materials.

Port of San Antonio:  The Empresa Portuaria San Antonio is an autonomous state-owned company.  The Board of Directors is named by the President.  It has awarded concessions to operate four facilities at the port, the principal ones being the Terminal Molo Sur and Terminal Norte.  Terminal Molo Sur specializes in container cargo and also handles grains and general cargo.  San Antonio Terminal International (Consorcio Sudamericana Agencias Aereas y Maritimas and S.S.A. Holdings International) has operated the terminal since 2000 under a 20-year concession.  It has invested US$42 million to date.  It plans to invest about US$16 million to expand its capacity to handle larger ships.  Terminal Norte specializes in grains.  Private operator Puerto Panul, S.A. runs the terminal under a 30-year concession.  Terminal Norte has invested about US$8.5 million to date.  There are other facilities in the interior of the port that have been concessioned to private operators including a chemical terminal operated by TERQUIM, S.A. and a sulfuric acid terminal for the state-owned mining company CODELCO.  Empresa San Antonio operates the common areas of the port and has invested US$15 million over the past three years to improve its installations and coastal area.  In the last ten years, the Port of San Antonio has experienced an average annual rate of growth of 13% for general cargo and 33% in containerized cargo.  In 2003, the total cargo moved by the Port of San Antonio was 9.7 million tons.  In 2002, San Antonio handled 4.7 million tons of containerized cargo, about 35% of the national total.  It reached 5.5 million tons in 2003, making it the second largest port handling containerized cargo on the western coast of South America.

Port of Valparaiso:  Empresa Portuaria Valparaiso is an autonomous state-owned company that manages the public areas of the port and oversees concessions to private operators.  The port handled 5.1 million tons, of which containerized cargo was 3.37 million tons.  The port facilities include a privately operated cargo terminal operated by Terminal Pacific Sur Valparaiso, S.A. and a cruise ship terminal operated by Valparaiso Terminal de Pasajeros, S.A.  Major projects under way at the port include the Southern Access Project funded by the government, which involves the construction of three urban tunnels.  The port will also concession the Extraport Zone Logistics Activities Project (ZEAL, Zona Extraportuaria de Actividades Logísticas).  It will involve an estimated $23 million investment by private operators who will offer services to multiple users, such as fiscalization, phytosanitary controls, logistical services, and industrial park.

Proposed Projects:  Although the government and private operators have made significant investments to upgrade the infrastructure and improve the productivity of the ports, both the Port of San Antonio and the Port of Valparaíso are developing projects designed to improve their export/import processes, improve security, and enhance the overall competitive position of the respective ports.  They are seeking to address the following problems:  lack of coordination between the point of origin of cargo and its arrival at the port; low levels of integration of the process of the various links in the supply chain; excessive waiting times for transmittal of paperwork; lack of information to trucks on route to the ports.

The Port of San Antonio is seeking to reduce costs and improve productivity with the development of projects designed to improve physical flows of traffic and information flows.  It has requested funding for a feasibility study that would evaluate its operations, physical layout, documentation procedures, and design a platform to be shared by the various agents at the port.  The objective of the project will be to reduce loading and unloading times, reduce congestion, make more efficient use of the port’s infrastructure and space, deliver current and secure information to operators and clients to facilitate decision making, improve the integration and connectivity among the various actors in the supply chain, reduce the time involved for the approval of documents, and maintain security.

The Port of Valparaiso has already begun investing in ICT and ITS projects to improve port logistics management.  The Port of Valparaiso is looking at how to integrate and expand these systems to incorporate new projects such as the Southern Access Project and ZEAL. 

The DM Contractor’s evaluation of the projects at the Port of Valparaiso and the Port of San Antonio should also evaluate each port’s status with regard to the implementation of security measures related to the IMO’s ISPS Code.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE


Colombia is a relatively well-developed country, with 85% of the population connected to the national grid.  According to the Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), nearly 2 million people, however, live in the “non-interconnected zones” (ZNI), located east of the mountains in the Amazon basin and the pacific coastal region, representing 52% of the national territory.  ZNI areas are provided electricity through isolated diesel engine/generator sets, where the diesel fuel delivery is by boat or barge (in the Amazon).  Due to the high delivery costs, most of these ZNI villages have electric operations for only 6 hours per day.  High logistics costs for fuel delivery have created the need for alternative or renewable energy solutions for ZNI villages, and for the servicing of remote infrastructure equipment.  

Colombia accommodates approximately 70% of the air traffic operations that over-fly the North-South Americas corridor.  As its location is quite strategic in terms of international commercial and passenger traffic, Colombia’s civil aviation authority, Unidad Administrativo Especial de Aeronáutica Civil (UAEAC), must service and maintain equipment in remote locations.  Equipment such as radar, aeronautical meteorology technology and air-to-land communications systems, and land communications equipment, must be serviced in mountainous and hard to reach locations in Colombia.  Currently the aforementioned equipment is being powered by inefficient electric generation plants run by internal combustion engines, which use fuel that must be carried over rustic terrain, raising the cost for servicing indispensable, expensive technology.  UAEAC estimates that alternative energy could potentially be used for 260 units of equipment, and foresees expenditures, in the amount of $160 million, for the purchase of a wind energy generation station in 2005.  

While the UAEAC proposal would represent a significant amount of the DM analysis, the other half would focus on project development with Colombian government institutions responsible for the promotion of new and/or alternate energy solutions in ZNI areas.  The projects to be reviewed by the DM contractor are the following:

·  UAEAC Alternative Energy Project (TA estimated at $700,000):  UAEAC requested
USTDA’s support in the development of an alternative energy development plan that would examine various types of alternative energy sources, primarily wind energy, that would help reduce and/or eliminate the cost of transporting fuel to remote locations.  The proposed development plan would provide unique specifications for the different components of alternative energy equipment, in terms of operational, technical and financial capacities, for remote area equipment.  UAEAC has proposed the evaluation of a potential pilot project for a wind energy farm.

·  During the week of April 29, 2004, members of the Inter-Institutional Rational Use of 
Energy Committee (CIURE) will meet to determine the next steps regarding rational energy usage and alternative energy sources in Colombia.  CIURE members include the Ministry of Mines and Energy, Foreign Trade, Environment, CREG (the Electric Energy Regulatory Commission) and Colciencias (Colombian Science Foundation).  The DM contractor, with the help of the U.S. Embassy in Bogotá, would meet with CIURE representatives to help Colombian agencies propose alternative energy projects for energy-deficient areas, such as the ZNI.  Additionally, the commercial services office in Bogotá has been working jointly with the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) on its Renewables for Sustainable Village Program, and it is expected that both offices would be able to provide the DM contractor with valuable guidance in the development of project ideas.

The DM contractor will evaluate the technical, economic, and financial viability of the recommended projects, working collectively with the U.S. embassy’s commercial services office in Bogotá and Colombian government officials, to determine which projects meet USTDA’s funding requirements in terms of the environmental impact, developmental priority, foreign competition, U.S. export potential and project financing.  Additionally, the DM contractor will evaluate the following:

·  Review UAEAC’s brief proposal and draft a concrete, detailed terms of reference for
identified projects that meet USTDA funding requirements.  Revise UAEAC’s budget estimate and prepare an appropriate task-based budget for the recommended scope of work.  If applicable, provide additional recommendations for follow-on work.  
-	Additionally, determine whether or not the TA would require an Orientation Visit 	
(Reverse Trade Mission) prior to implementation.  If applicable, prepare a detailed OV recommendation that would include a justification, detailed budget estimate, OV destinations, number and names of potential delegates, and potential U.S. participants (e.g. U.S. suppliers, financing agencies, etc.). 
·  Coordinate meetings, with the help of Julio Carbo-FSN at the U.S. Embassy in Bogotá, 
private and/or public entities, such as the CIURE members, which include the Ministry of Mines and Energy, Foreign Trade, Environment, CREG (the Electric Energy Regulatory Commission) and Colciencias (Colombian Science Foundation), that are interested in alternative energy development.  
-  	Recommend potential projects that meet USTDA funding requirements.  Prepare a detailed TOR and a task-based budget for each recommended scope of work.
-  	Contact the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory 
   	(NREL) for further project leads and/or guidance.
·  Determine if the UAEAC project can be combined with other recommended projects 
for the ZNI remote location areas, and prepare an appropriate scope of work and budget accordingly. 
·  Evaluate and confirm the potential for possible U.S. exports, listing potential service 
providers and sources of alternative energy equipment.  Additionally, the DM contractor will address potential outcomes of proposed projects and will address the necessary development indicators, writing a development objective for the TOR of each recommended TA.  
·  Prepare a series of funding recommendations for USTDA and issue a Final Report.

Prior to a final recommendation, the DM contractor will collaborate with the USTDA COTR to evaluate whether recommended projects meet USTDA funding requirements.  The DM contractor will be charged with researching new opportunities in which USTDA can be of assistance, including feasibility studies, technical Assistance, orientation visits, technical advisors or business briefings.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE


Since the privatization of the state oil company PETROPERU in 1996, private companies have initiated most of Peru’s hydrocarbon exploration and production activities.  While Peru is now more open than ever to foreign and/or private participation, Peru has still suffered from low exploration and development drilling activity.  In light of Peru’s dependence on oil imports, the lack of upstream activity has become a sensitive issue in the country’s energy sector.  President Toledo has made several efforts in 2002 to encourage oil and mining exploration by attracting more foreign oil investment in part by making investment terms more attractive and providing promotional offerings of new blocks for oil and gas exploration. The government is hopeful that its efforts will provide more incentive to U.S. and foreign companies interested in procuring E&P contracts.  

As the public entity responsible for the promotion of private capital investment in the hydrocarbon sector, PERUPETRO has asked USTDA to consider the provision of additional funds to support its exploration efforts.  The following descriptions are some of the projects under consideration:  

·  Satellite Imagery Off-shore Exploration TA (Estimated at $480,000):  The objective of this project is to utilize satellite imagery to determine the location of hydrocarbon seeps in Peru’s off-shore waters.  Seeps help provide evidence of hydrocarbon occurrences, and are associated with many major discoveries.  PERUPETRO is hopeful that this information will help to identify locations for more intensive exploration efforts.  

  ·  On-shore Hydrocarbon Exploration TA (Estimated at $497,000):  The objective of the
  project is to identify on-shore locations that contain hydrocarbon plays, prospects and 
  leads that qualify for presentation to interested oil and gas companies.  The TA would   
  involve a geologic, geophysical and economic evaluation of prospective on-shore areas.  

 ·   Two Database Development projects (Total Estimate of $540,000):  The objective of these projects would be to create, standardize and modernize PERUPETRO’s extensive database.  One project would compile and analyze gravity and magnetic data for seven hydrocarbon basins, while the second project would organize and integrate existing geologic-geochemical data and maps for PERUPETRO’s 18 hydrocarbon basins, utilizing modern hydrocarbon concepts and analysis.

In September 2003, USTDA obligated funds for the “PERUPETRO Hydrocarbon Exploration Technical Assistance” project.  The proposed projects listed above will complement the information and identified projects that result from the TA currently being funded by USTDA.  The DM contractor would also be charged with researching new opportunities in which USTDA can be of assistance.  For example, PERUPETRO has requested assistance in the development of a Business Briefing to present identified projects to interested U.S. companies.  Furthermore, PERUPETRO is also interested in technical advisory for new assignments and/or follow-on work, which will also be explored in the DM.  Under this DM assignment the contractor will be required to evaluate and recommend new projects in addition to the projects described above.

Prior to a final recommendation, the DM contractor will collaborate with the USTDA COTR to evaluate the technical, economic, and financial viability of proposed projects.  All projects must meet USTDA funding criteria in terms of a project’s U.S. export potential, environmental impact, developmental priority, foreign competition and financing potential. 

Additionally, the DM contractor will be charged with the following responsibilities:

·	Draft a concrete, detailed terms of reference for those identified projects that meet USTDA funding requirements, and provide additional recommendations for follow-on work.  Determine whether or not TA work can/should be conducted in the U.S. or Peru, and prepare an appropriate budget for the recommended scope of work.  
·	Evaluate and confirm the potential for possible U.S. exports, listing potential service providers and sources of hydrocarbon exploration equipment.  In light of the heavy foreign competition for E&P contracts and the procurement of equipment and consulting services, this aspect of the study will be crucial.  As such, the DM contractor will recommend follow-up business briefings, to be held in the U.S., in order to present identified exploration projects to U.S. companies and/or investors.  The DM contractor will be asked to identify companies that would be interested in attending potential briefings and/or participating as technical advisors.
·	For the proposed TA projects that require use of a workstation, the DM contractor must confirm whether or not all the necessary data, provided by the project sponsor, PERUPETRO, is conditioned and suitable for the required tasks, and if not, include a task in the recommended TOR that addresses those concerns. 
·	The DM contractor will address potential outcomes of proposed projects and will address all the necessary development indicators, writing a development objective for the Terms of Reference of each recommended TA, the results of which will be reported in the Final TA Report.
·	Prepare a series of funding recommendations for USTDA and issue a Final Report.

6		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

This definitional mission will evaluate the terms, feasibility, and impact of five telecommunications projects proposed by the Government of Colombia.  The proposed technical assistance projects would contribute to enhanced competition in the Colombian telecom market and foster the adoption of new telecom technologies.  The project proposals were presented by three potential grantees: the Ministry of Communications (MinComm), the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (CRT), and the Civil Aeronautical Special Administrative Unit (AeroCivil).  The MinComm and CRT jointly proposed four projects: long distance competition, local loop unbundling (LLU), emerging technology development, and text messaging service interconnectivity.  AeroCivil presented a proposal for the aeronautical telecom network development project.

MinComm/CRT Projects:
1)	Long Distance Competition Project:  The objective of the proposed technical assistance is to encourage greater competition in the long distance service market through a reassessment of the license price.  When the long distance market was opened in 1997, the price of a long distance service license was set at $150 million.  MinComm and CRT wish to conduct a study to update the license price given the evolution of new services and technologies, as well as new market conditions since 1997.  The cost of the technical assistance is estimated to be $165,000.

2)	Local Loop Unbundling Project:  The objective of the technical assistance is to encourage the adoption of broadband technology through the unbundling of the local loop. Given the inability of the current service providers to develop the broadband market through DSL technology, MinComm and CRT wish to undertake local loop unbundling to permit the adoption of broadband technologies.  The cost of the technical assistance is estimated to be $190,000.

3)	Emerging Technology Development Project:  The objective of the technical assistance is to expand internet access to rural areas of Colombia utilizing technologies such as Wireless-Fidelity (Wi-Fi), digital video broadcasting (DVB), and Power Line Communications (PLC).  The targeted end users are health, educational, and local government institutions. The cost of the technical assistance is estimated to $335,000.

4)	Text Messaging Service Interconnectivity Project:  The objective of the technical assistance is to expand the text messaging market by developing interconnectivity between the two main messaging formats currently in use in Colombia (cellular and PCS).  Interconnectivity would increase the use of and demand for short message service (SMS) and multimedia message service (MMS), promoting sector development and improved customer service.  The cost of the technical assistance is estimated to be $97,000.

AeroCivil Project:  
5)	Aeronautical Telecom Network Development Project:  The objective of the technical assistance is to update the existing voice and data telecom networks in the civil aviation sector and to foster the development of new civil aviation-related telecom services.  The estimated cost of the proposed technical assistance has yet to be determined.

CELTA, which stands for the Center of Logistics and Transportation Activities, has proposed the following three projects: the integrated perishable inspection system project, the west air cargo terminal project at El Dorado International Airport, and the El Dorado International Airport access road project.  The proposed projects would contribute to improved trade opportunities for Colombian agricultural producers and would foster the adoption of new phytosanitary and security inspection technologies.

CELTA has outlined the three following inter-related projects:

1)	Integrated Perishable Inspection System Project:  The objective of the technical assistance is to examine the development of a perishable inspection complex at CELTA.  The perishable inspection complex would enable local farmers to comply with phytosanitary and security regulations necessary for the timely export of fresh produce and flowers through the use of phytosanitary treatment and cargo inspection systems.  The cost of the technical assistance has yet to be determined.

2)	West Air Cargo Terminal Project at El Dorado International Airport:  The objective of the technical assistance is to evaluate the development of a new air cargo terminal at the El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá.  While the El Dorado International Airport moves the largest quantity of air cargo in Latin America (85% of which are perishable agricultural products), the existing East Air Cargo Terminal does not have adequate phytosanitary and security inspection equipment and is not convenient to local farmers and agribusinesses located west of the airport.  As a result, CELTA has proposed the development of a new air cargo terminal designed to satisfy security and inspection requirements for air cargo exports and imports, as well as for efficient cargo handling and cross-docking, proper cold-chain management, and timely inspection and documentation services.  The new air cargo terminal would offer dry, cold, and refrigerated storage; cross-docking; truck loading/unloading; and a pest spraying facility.  The cost of the technical assistance has yet to be determined.

3)	El Dorado International Airport Access Road Project:  The objective of the technical assistance is to evaluate the modernization of an airport access road to ensure the safe, secure, and rapid transport of air cargo from CELTA to the El Dorado International Airport.  Perishable agricultural goods are produced in a region west of the airport known as the savannah.  However, the existing east air cargo terminal can be only reached using Avenida 26 and thus all vehicles transporting fresh produce and flowers for export have to travel through Bogotá.  The proposed technical assistance is expected to examine the development of the following: a security checkpoint, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) technologies, and an x-ray cargo container and vehicle inspection system.  The cost of the technical assistance has yet to be determined.

6		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

This Definitional Mission will evaluate the terms, feasibility, and impact of two E-government projects proposed by the Government of Peru (GOP).  The Presidency of the Council of Ministers (PCM, also known as the Office of the Prime Minister) has proposed the development of two projects: the virtual government database project and the public Internet center project.  These E-government projects would contribute to improved GOP service to its citizens and more efficient citizen interaction with the GOP, and would foster the adoption of new information technologies.

The PCM, through its National Office on Electronic and Information Government, has outlined the two following E-government projects:

1) 	Virtual Government Database Project:  The objective of the technical assistance is to examine the development of a portal that would link existing local and federal government databases, as well as enable efficient citizen access to a single national database.  The cost of the technical assistance has yet to be determined.

2) 	Public Internet Center Project:  The objective of the technical assistance is to examine the development of Public Internet Centers.  Public Internet Centers would enable citizens without home Internet access to conveniently utilize E-government services and would help to bridge the digital divide by expanding access to the Internet.  The cost of the technical assistance has yet to be determined.

This Definitional Mission will evaluate and make recommendations on the two projects outlined above, as well as other potential GOP E-government projects identified during the Mission.  This Definitional Mission should consider and evaluate other E-government projects to assist the GOP in implementing their 2003-2006 National Information Development Plan.  The proposed technical assistance projects should build on past USTDA-funded E-government activities, such as the 1996 National Registry and ID Card Feasibility Study and the 1996 Government Wide Area Network (WAN) System Feasibility Study.
