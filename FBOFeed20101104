The rentable space must yield a minimum of 4025 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years.

 33 paved surface parking spaces
 Specific Information Technology requirements

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

(1) The owner or owners of 51 percent or more of the offeror is/are service-disabled Veteran(s), or an eligible surviving spouse thereof, as applicable, for the instant acquisition. In this regard, the apparently successful offeror shall submit a VA Form 0877 to CVE via VA's VIP at www.vetbiz.gov, internet site. This confidential and secure electronic application will enable CVE to inform the CO of the service-disabled Veteran or Veteran status of the owner(s) of the offeror without the CO having to receive and secure confidential individually identifiable information or personal health care information on this topic.

(2) Eligible parties own 51 percent or more of the concern (see 38 CFR 74.3). Adequate documentation can include copies of official stock certificates, articles of incorporation, partnership agreement, operating agreement, or other similar documentation which reasonably demonstrates the percentage of ownership by eligible parties; and

(3) Eligible parties control the concern (See 38 CFR 74.4). Control include both the strategic policy setting excercised, for example, by boards of directors, and the day-to-day management and administration of business operations.  Adequate documentation should include articles of incorporation, corporate by-laws, partnership agreement, operating agreement, resumes, disclosure of any other current employment, or other relevant documentation, as applicable, which demonstrates control of the strategic and day-to-day management of the offeror by eligible parties, as applicable.

(b) CVE  will examine the business documents to determine if they establish appropriate ownership and control of the business from which an offer has been received. Within 21 business days, CVE shall determine whether the firm can or cannot be verified as a SDVOSB or VOSB, as appropriate, and issue its decision theron to the vendor in accordance with 38 CFR 74.11(e) and to the CO.  The CO will use CVE's decision in making the source selection decision.

(c) If a competing vendor raises a status protest prior to CVE's completion of its verification examination,, the CO may rely on the status protest decision when issued

(d) This deviation will expire December 31, 2011. Thereafter, in accordance with VAAR 804.1102, CO's shall only make awards to SDVOSBs or VOSBs which are listed as verified in VIP at: www.vetbiz.gov.

All offerors are further advised that as a result of this requirement being a general construction project, set -aside for SDVOSB concerns, that a minimum of 15% of all labor required to perform the contract requirement must be from the SDVOSB contractor or as a combination of the prime SDVOSB contractor and their SDVOSB subcontractors.  The potential successful offeror will be required to submit written evidence to the Contracting Officer demonstrating how they intend to meet the minimum self-performance requirement prior to an award being made.

<a href="mailto:caitlin.sontowski@navy.mil">caitlin.sontowski@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Contracting Department Philadelphia Office intends to solicit on an unrestricted basis a requirement for Operation and Maintenance (O&M) services in support of the Forces Surveillance Support Center (FSSC) Relocatable Over the Horizon Radar (ROTHR) System.  The ROTHR System is a radar system that detects and tracks drug trafficking activities in Northern South American and Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico basins.  It is used by the Navy, North American Defense (NORAD), Customs, Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and other national security agencies.  ROTHR Systems are located in Virginia, Texas, and Puerto Rico.  The Contractor shall operate, maintain, and support the ROTHR Systems 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
  Additionally, the effort includes systems engineering, engineering change proposal preparation and analysis, failure analysis, configuration management, preparation, installation and testing of field change kits, logistics support, training, and repair and refurbishment services.  This requirement presents several challenges to the Contractor including having to work with a mature system, dealing with parts obsolescence, and the Government does not possess the Level III technical data associated with this unique legacy system.  See Numbered Note 26.  

FISC will be conducting an Industry Day for the requirement on Wednesday, 01 December 2010 in Chesapeake, VA.  The purpose of this Industry Day is to provide interested parties with an overview of the ROTHR O&M requirement, as well as to discuss a draft of the possible Request for Proposals (RFP).
  A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this draft RFP and Industry Day meeting shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.  Questions and comments from Industry are welcome and encouraged prior to and during the meeting.  All questions and answers may be subject to being shared with all prospective offerors.  As this is not a solicitation, no attendee should view this as an opportunity to exhibit its qualifications or technical merit that distinguish itself from others in attendance.  Questions and conversation that appears to steer in this direction will be discouraged. Participation in the Industry Day is strictly voluntary and the U.S.
 Government will not reimburse contractors for any cost incurred for their participation. In addition, any information provided to the Government is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. All information discussed and/or provided to the Government will be considered. However, in the event that a solicitation is issued, the solicitation will represent the Government's final decision and no explanation for the Government's rationale as to what is or is not ultimately included will be provided.

Specific details regarding this Industry Day as well as a draft of the RFP will be posted at the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website (www.neco.navy.mil) no later than 17 November 2010.
   Request that you please hold all comments/questions until this information is received and thoroughly reviewed.

<SUBJECT>Paleoliquefaction Studies in Moderate Seismicity Regions with a History of Large Events
<SOLNBR>RFP-NRC-04-10-159
<ARCHDATE>05312011
<CONTACT>Jeffrey R. Mitchell, Phone (301) 492-3639, Fax (301) 492-3437, Email jeffrey.mitchell@nrc.gov
<DESC>BACKGROUND
<p>During the CEUS SSC (Central and Eastern U. S. Seismic Source Characterization) project for nuclear facilities, the critical importance of paleoliquefaction studies was recognized. For the CEUS SSC project the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) funded work to assemble, assess, and document available liquefaction field results and to quantitatively describe uncertainty in the characterization of paleoliquefaction sites. As a result of this work, two areas of future research were identified; (1) standardization of field studies and (2) further field work on areas where large paleo-events have occurred but a high level of uncertainty still exists.</p>
<p>As a result of this work, the NRC recognized a need for a comprehensive NUREG Report focused on standard procedures to identify, document, and interpret paleoliquefaction features in the regions that have large, but rare earthquakes (e.g. New Madrid, Wabash Valley, and Charleston Seismic Zones). The NUREG/CR Report to be developed will provide guidance for conducting paleoliquefaction studies in order to improve the state of practice and to allow NRC staff to reduce uncertainties associated with the recurrence interval of large earthquakes in the region. To facilitate use and adoption of the procedures presented in the report, the NRC expects a training workshop to be offered (e.g. in the New Madrid seismic zone) for the participants (which will consist principally of NRC staff)) to learn from experts in the field and gain experience searching for, documenting, and interpreting liquefaction features.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objectives of this work are a NUREG/CR Report to standardize procedures to identify, document, and interpret paleoliquefaction features in the regions of the CEUS that have large, but rare earthquakes for the purpose of reducing uncertainties in the recurrence estimates and source models for large events, to reduce uncertainty in the characterization of previously identified large paleo-events, and to provide training to NRC staff on paleoliquefaction field methods and interpretation.</p>
<p>PRESOLICITATION INFORMATION</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this requirement will result in one (1) contract award. It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance of the resultant contract will be thirty six (36) months from date of award.</p>
<p>The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about December 1, 2010 and the closing date for proposals will be 30 days from the date the full solicitation gets posted. The solicitation will be available solely through the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website. The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

                              REPLACE 480 GENERATOR 
                                            575-11-107
                                               
                                                          


This is a design-build construction project.  This project will replace, relocate and upgrade the Building 1 north generator plant at Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Grand Junction, Colorado.

DESCRIPTION
This design/build construction project will provide for the replacement and upgrade of a Cummins 460 KW, 575 KVA diesel powered generator.  A remote concrete foundation will support the new generator plant.  The new generator shall be supported by a monitored underground diesel fuel storage tank. The existing space will be refurbished to become a centralized area for transfer switches and distribution components.


HISTORY

The existing generator plant and day tank are located in a room adjacent to the main switch gear room of the Out Patient Addition (OPA) of Building 1.  The fuel storage tank is located within fifteen (15) feet of the generator.  Replacement of these items is due to age and increased load demand of the OPA.  All equipment is in operation and is providing functional service as originally designed.  The existing diesel fuel storage tank is a double lined fiberglass tank with a volume and leakage monitoring system.  


INTENT

As this project is a Design/Build, the contractor is expected to survey the existing system, conduct investigations on the electrical load connected to the subject generator plant and transfer switches, calculate existing/future loads and design a backup electrical power system which would include but not be limited to generator, environmentally protective fuel tanks, transfer switches, cabling, distribution panels and monitoring systems.  The contract would expect the design to include a new concrete based structure, constructed at an area that is separated from the OPA.  The design would consider electrical components that provide voltage and phase matching technology.  Efficient fuel consumption would also be considered in the design.  Design considerations may include utilizing existing fuel storage tanks for the fuel supply in lieu of a new underground storage tank.  The generator plant shall be fitted with all systems required to maintain a fully charged battery grid and appropriate engine temperature.  The status of the backup power system shall be electronically monitored from within the utility plant, Building 9.

The design and construction of the new generator will be coordinated such that at no time will the Medical Center be without a backup electrical power supply.  All design will comply with VA security standards.

Upon placement and connection of the new generator equipment, demolition of the existing generator unit would provide for the area being utilized as a space completely designated for new and relocated transfer switches.  Removal of the existing fuel tank would require testing for soil contamination.  Remedial abatement would be addressed by this contract.    

Trades involving carpentry, ironworking, masonry, stucco, painting, plumbing/pipefitting, mechanical and electrical shall be utilized for the installation of material and systems.
All work will be coordinated through Engineering Service.  Davis-Bacon wage rates are to apply.


GENERAL 

Completion period:  270 days from NTP

All design and work will conform to the current edition of the VA Master Specifications and VA Design Standards as published at the following site: www.cfm.va.gov, ASHRAE, IBC 2003, NFPA AND NEC building codes and standards.


The C&A requirements do not apply.  A security Accreditation package is not required.

<DESC>DATA LINK SYSTEM for Next-generation Training Pod for Air Combat Training System<br />FedBizOpps -- Request for Information:
<p>The Air Force Material Command, Air Armament Center (AAC) is evaluating impacts of the proposed Government sell-off of 1755-1850 MHz frequency band with proposed offset frequency bands of 4.4-4.94 GHz and 5.95-6.7 GHz. Technical options for the P5 Combat Training System are being considered and Government cost estimating is being accomplished, taking into consideration preferred technical approaches. THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BID (IFB) OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.<br /><br />The AAC recognizes the importance of industry involvement in the development of technical options. Below are a number of design characteristics and constraints for interested industry partners to seed immediate discussions. All interested parties are asked to respond with proposed technical approaches to Mr Paul Leary, Jr. by 23 Nov 2010. Interested parties are encouraged to email paul.leary@eglin.af.mil or call Mr Leary at (850) 883-3464 to discuss technical options. Mr Edward McCall is our alternate contact. He can be reached at (850) 833-3787, or email to edward.mccall@eglin.af.mil.<br /><br />In light of the propagation and atmospheric attenuation considerations and the physical design limitations imposed by the 4.4-4.94 GHz and 5.95-6.7 GHz frequency bands, non-traditional approaches to achieving required RF network performance will be entertained. Discussions can continue beyond 23 Nov 2010, but the Government cost estimating schedule requires that initial concepts be identified and communicated to cost estimators by 1 Dec 2010.<br /><br />Design Characteristics and Constraints:<br />&bull; The digital data link transceiver will have the option to operate at 4.4-4.94 GHz and/or 5.95-6.7 GHz<br />&bull; Design will achieve a technology readiness level (ref DoD Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) Deskbook) of 6 or more by 2015<br />&bull; The data link transceiver will be a shop replaceable assembly contained in airborne, shipboard, and ground-based instrumentation packages used to support air combat training<br />&bull; Support networking/IP-based data traffic exchanges in broadcast (point-to-multi-point) and unicast (point-to-point) modes with air, ground, and shipboard nodes (both stationary and moving)<br />&bull; Support 100 to 160 high dynamic military fighter aircraft nodes concurrently in an ad hoc self forming/self healing network<br />&bull; Meet the environmental requirements of a high performance military fighter aircraft<br />&bull; Meet the environmental requirements of a military helicopter<br />&bull; Meet DoD electromagnetic interference requirements<br />&bull; Operate over all altitudes from 0-60,000 feet<br />&bull; Exhibit a system-level mean time between failure of at least 500 hours operational<br />&bull; Be designed for producibility and sustainability<br />&bull; Provide successful Air-to-Air digital communications connectivity 95+% of the time at 65 nautical miles (nmi) and 90+% of the time at 65-80 nmi given unobstructed line of sight between communications nodes<br />&bull; Provide successful Air-to-Ground digital communications connectivity 90+% of the time at 125 nmi given unobstructed line of sight between communications nodes<br />&bull; Provide system Air-to-Ground digital communications connectivity 85+% of the time at 200 nmi, utilizing relays if required, given unobstructed line of sight between individual communications nodes<br />&bull; Support an overall network user data throughput of 0.5-2.0 Mbps<br />&bull; Support a message latency of 50 ms or less<br />&bull; Support an airborne pod configuration constrained to an aircraft compatible shape, traditionally an AIM-9 missile tube volume. If necessary, solutions will not be limited to an AIM-9 missile tube volume or to a single pod. <br />&bull; Weight and shape cannot constrain aircraft's combat performance and must meet air worthiness requirements<br />&bull; Prefer a design that, for a single component of the training system, supports not more than a three man lift<br />&bull; Solution must be compatible with aircraft power<br />In the November 2010 response, please include:</p>
<p>A. Proposed solution (mark &lsquo;proprietary' as appropriate) and specific driving challenges to the development (technology and technical risk, safety, reliability, miniaturization requirements, production, etc)<br />B. Contractor's contact information for further discussion of the proposed solution<br />C. Contractor experience in this area <br />D. Contractor facility location</p>

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a Sources Sought Notice Only. This Sources Sought Synopsis constitutes a request for information to assist the Air Force in conducting market research of industry to gain knowledge and identify potential qualified sources and their size classifications (Service Disabled Veteran-Owned, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Women-Owned Small Business, HubZone 8(a), 8(a), HubZone, Small Business, Emerging Small Business, Small Disadvantage Business (SDB), and Large Business that may meet Air Force requirements for an Interim Contractor Support (ICS) services contract for the JTE program.
<p>The Hill AFB, Utah Range Threat System Program Office (RTSPO) intends to generate a purchase request leading to a contract for these Interim Contractor Support (ICS) services. The government will procure an ICS services contract for the Joint Threat Emitter (JTE) Block 0, Kit 1 program. The ICS contract which includes remote support, emergency depot LRU replacement, repair support, software sustainment, overseas and field support, engineering changes, and obsolescence observation, will allow the government to effectively sustain the fielded JTE Block 0, Kit 1 systems until the foundation for organic support is prepared. An ICS contract similar to that of this Sources Sought is currently in place for the JTE Block 0, Kit 1 program as contract FA8217-09-C-0014. The current option expires 27 Aug 2011 with one remaining one-year option. Another contractual arrangement is necessary to provide continued support. No feasible alternatives for immediate support exist. Since organic support infrastructure is not in place at this time, support from an ICS provider is necessary to maintain immediate operations. The ICS contract is a means for immediate support, though temporary in nature, which must be provided in a timely and efficient manner. JTE Block 0, Kit 1 systems are currently fielded at five locations: 5 TEUs, 1 Mobile C2U and 2 Fixed C2Us at Mountain Home AFB ID; 5 TEU and 2 Fixed C2Us at Nellis AFB NV; 2 TEUs, 1 Wideband TEU and 1 Fixed C2U at Alpena ANG MI; 1 TEU and 1 Fixed C2U at Poinsett ECR SC; and 1 TEU and 1 C2U at the contractor's facility in Buffalo NY for development and testing. The current JTE production contract will provide 4 additional TEUs and 1 additional C2Us with a projected overall fielding plan as follows: 1 TEU at Nellis AFB NV, 1 TEU at Poinsett ECR SC, and 2 TEUs and 1 Fixed C2U at Townsend Range GA. The option periods will include efforts to provide support for one Navy JTE unit. The scope of this effort will be equivalent to the effort provided to the JTE units owned by the Air Force.</p>
<p>The contract award may be against a new contract, an existing delivery order contract, and/or an existing delivery order. The anticipated contract period of performance is a one year basic period, with two one-year options.</p>
<p>The government does not have a comprehensive technical data package that can be released to support this procurement. The threat emitter unit (TEU) signal generator (CEESIM) software/hardware is an example of technical data (for all TEU configurations) that the government does not have adequate rights to use as a technical data package to support this ICS requirement. The government also does not have the related subsystem specifications in their possession to include in a technical data package. Any interested parties must clearly identify with supporting rationale if they have the ability to meet the requirements without a complete technical data package from the government. At a minimum, the following is the technical data and software associated with the JTE Block 0, Kit 1 configuration that cannot be released due to limited and/or restricted rights:</p>
<p>- Threat emitter unit signal generator (CEESIM) software<br />- Range data integration processor components of the command &amp; control subsystem software<br />- Mission situation awareness terminal components of the command &amp; control subsystem software<br />- Transmitter controller software</p>
<p>Access to this data is also required to meet the site survey, infrastructure planning/utilization, and integration/deployment requirements associated with this effort due to the need to understand fully the structure and timing of the data sent and received via system internal and external interfaces.</p>
<p>This effort may require access to and processing of classified information up to and including SECRET/NOFORN security requirements. If required, a corresponding DD254 will be provided as part of the associated solicitation. Contract performance may also involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) shall be provided copies of any related solicitation or other data subject to foreign disclosure restrictions. Contact the Defense Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan 40917-3084 (1-800-353-3572) for further information on the certification process. You may have to submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for any related solicitation.</p>
<p>Each interested entity that has the capability to meet the ICS requirements for JTE Block 0 Kit 1 hereby has the opportunity to provide supporting rationale to that effect. Each interested entity (that has the capability to meet all requirements is requested to provide the following information to help the Air Force determine prospective contractors:</p>
<p>(1) Supporting rationale must show evidence (from the company that has complete data, drawing, software, etc. package for each requirement) that this company is providing or willing to provide this package to the company that is responding to the sources-sought-synopsis.<br />(2) Supporting rationale that they have the expertise and capability to meet such requirements and provide full support to the JTE system without delay upon contract start date.</p>

2.  Contractor/laboratory shall provide acceptable MDL studies for all parameters.
3. The Contractor/laboratory may not sub contract any analysis out.
4.  In order to receive an award the laboratory must be approved by Mid-Pacific Region's Environmental Office MP-157.  Approval will include but not be limited to passing a Quality Assurance Audit below, receiving an acceptable review of the laboratory's QA Manual, round-robin performance evaluation samples, and reporting limits.
Audit Process:
The MP-157 quality assurance (QA) section conducts audits on laboratories involved in analytical activities that support MP-157 Mid-Pacific Region projects.  The audit consists of reviewing the laboratory's QA manual and the last three years of approved round-robin performance study results, submitting performance evaluation samples, and conducting an onsite audit.  The review process allows the QA section to determine if laboratories are capable of performing quality analyses on Mid-Pacific Region samples while following QA/QC practices that meet or exceed Mid-Pacific Region standards and protocols.
Background Review:
Prior to the audit, the QA section will contact the laboratory QA officer or the laboratory director and request a copy of both the current QA manual and the last three years of approved round-robin performance study results.  The performance study results and QA manual are reviewed by the QA section.
Performance Evaluation Samples:
Prior to the onsite audit, the QA section conducts a performance audit by submitting performance evaluation samples.  The purpose of the performance evaluation samples is to evaluate the laboratory's ability to generate accurate data.  If the laboratory performs poorly on the performance evaluation samples, the QA section may consider not conducting the onsite audit.  The parameters submitted for the performance evaluation samples will be tailored to reflect those of current Mid-Pacific Region projects and the methods the laboratory performs.  
If the laboratory does not obtain a result within the acceptance criteria, the laboratory will be directed to reanalyze the sample(s).  If the reanalyzed result is within the acceptance criteria, then the performance audit is considered acceptable.  If the laboratory still does not meet the acceptance criteria upon reanalysis, a new performance evaluation sample from a different lot or vendor will be submitted.  If the laboratory can obtain an acceptable result on the new performance evaluation sample, the performance audit is considered acceptable.  If the laboratory does not meet the acceptance on the original, reanalysis, or new performance evaluation sample, the laboratory will not be audited or approved for this method/parameter.
Audit Agenda:
Approximately one week prior to the audit, the auditor will send the laboratory contact a proposed audit agenda.  The audit agenda details the time allotted for the initial meeting with management, analytical method review, document review, and debrief.  After laboratory review and approval, the audit agenda will be finalized. Onsite Audit:
An onsite laboratory audit is conducted by the QA section to assess the laboratory's expertise in conducting the analyses, the capability for producing valid data, the ability to effectively support the data, and the integrity of the QA/QC practices. Meet with Management:
The first step of the audit will be to meet with management and key laboratory personnel to discuss the purpose of the audit and give a general overview about the Mid-Pacific Region and the Environmental Monitoring Branch (MP-157).  During this meeting, the audit team will discuss MP-157's policies and requirements, the performance evaluation sample results (if available), document request, and questions for the QA Officer (QAO).   Analytical Method and Document Review:
During the onsite audit, the QA officer, analysts, and other key laboratory personnel are questioned to determine their overall understanding of the methods and laboratory procedures.  Documentation practices are also reviewed.  In general, the auditors are checking to see if the laboratory procedures follow the laboratory's QA manual guidelines and the EPA method, Standard method, or other method protocols.
Debrief:
The most serious deviations are presented to the laboratory as findings in a debrief meeting at the end of the audit; the debrief is generally conducted the day after the audit.  All the deviations are written as findings or observations in the final audit report.  Audit Report:
Any deviations from accepted protocols are written in an audit report as findings.  The report can also include good practices for any procedures that the auditors would like the laboratory to continue and observations for any procedures that the auditors would like the laboratory to adopt.  Laboratory Audit Response and Final Approval LetterThe laboratory is asked to send a response to each finding detailed in the QA section's audit report.  The auditors will review this response and assess if the corrective actions and explanations are acceptable.  If any response is questionable, the laboratory is contacted for clarification.
Once the review of the laboratory's audit response is complete, the lead auditor will send a final letter addressing whether or not the laboratory is approved for use.
Central Contractor Registration (CCR), as required by FAR 4.1102, applies to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on CCR registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.

This capability includes supporting the following pilot tasks during all applicable phases of flight: Section Leader (SL), Non-Radar Ground Threat Reaction and Aircraft Survivability Equipment, Familiarization (GTR &amp; ASE FAM), Defensive Measures (DM), Chemical, Biological, Radiation, and Nuclear (CBRN), Expeditionary Shore-Based Tactics (EXP), Assault Transport Tactics (AT), Aerial Delivery Tactics (AD)<br />Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel Tactics (TRAP), Aerial Evacuation Tactics (AE), Raid Tactics (RAID) <br />Aviation Delivered Ground Refueling Tactics (ADGR), and Sea Based Tactics (SEA).</p>
<p>The CPT will incorporate sufficient functionality to support effective training for the above described performance tasks. Systems/components that support this functionality include: Basic cockpit structure/frame, Operational Software, In-Cockpit Communications System (ICS), Connectivity (to other simulators and/or training devices), Rudimentary Visual System (forward Image Generator (IG) and screens), Rudimentary Fight Controls (e.g., stick, collective, pedals, power levers, etc.), and Aural Cueing.</p>
<p>In addition, the CPT effort will require: Program Management, Quality Assurance (QA), Information Assurance (IA), Tactical Environment Network (TEn), Documentation, Integration and Testing, Shipping, Interim Logistics Support.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to supply GFE with this procurement.</p>
<p>The CPT will utilize existing operational software where available from other CH-53E training devices as Government Furnished Information (GFI) to ensure maximum compatibility and interoperability. Interoperability will be via the United States Marine Corps (USMC) Tactical Environment (TEn) Version 4.0 or newer also provided as GFI.</p>

<DESC><BR>Under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering (RDEC) Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division (NDC), Kansas Street, Natick, MA on behalf of the U. S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, Natick, MA intends to negotiate and award a Contract on a sole source basis with Blue Ridge, 117 West 4th St, Ranson, WV 25438.  <BR>1) FAR Statutory Authority cited: <BR>13.106-1 (b )(1) - only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<BR>2) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs:<BR>Systems hardware maintenance (12 months) for Sun El0K and E15K.<BR>3) A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.):<BR>Blue Ridge is currently the only vendor that can maintain this equipment and can guarantee parts for maintenance since the equipment is over 5 years old. Since this system is over 5 years old it's critical to have a vendor who is provides expertise in maintenance of this equipment, Blue Ridge has provided the government with this service in the past two fiscal years.<BR>4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR>Other vendors who would cover servers over 5 years old could not be identified. It is standard in the hardware industry for Tier I vendors such as Dell to discontinue support after a system reaches 5 years of age and is considered End of Life by that vendor, finding a Tier II vendor to support aging equipment has historically been a difficult task as most Tier II vendors do not specialize in aging equipment due to the fact that industry does not make it standard practice to operate on older equipment. The agency finds itself in this position due to the FY10 Moratorium on IT spending as issued by the CIO/G6 office to cap spending on installation data centers in an effort to migrate these data centers to CONUS wide enterprise data centers. Last date for Natick for the data center consolidation plan is FY15 so Natick needs to continue operating systems independently for five years.<BR>5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<BR>Contract will expire on November 8, 2010 and we run the risk of running without maintenance, if equipment breaks down mission users will not have access to critical financial systems. The financial systems that will not be available are the Oracle Financial Database (OFD), Labor Transfer System (LTS), MIPR system, Budget Planning System (BPS), Internal Calibrations System (ICS), Contract Transfer System (CTS) and Program Wide Activities System (PROWAS). NSRDEC has over 350 users on these systems and would have to resort to manual processing of MIPRs and financial reconciliation, NSRDEC has come to rely on these automated systems and is not resourced to be able to continue operations following a 15 year old manual processing model.<BR>6) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:<BR>With the age of the Sun Unix equipment the actions the agency can take to overcome barriers to competition are being taken but will result in a FY12 solution in a best case scenario. For FY11 the agency requires the support of Blue Ridge.<BR>7) Technical/Requirements Certification:<BR>I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<BR><BR> Any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 5 days from the date of publication of this announcement.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements, yet must be limited to 2 pages.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to award a Sole Source contract using simplified acquisitions procedures for commercial items (FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.5) to procure Forum SentrySOA XML Gateways Model number 3564, 4564, or later models and maintenance, from Forum Systems, Inc., 233 Needham Street, Ste 520, Newton, MA 02464.  The Period of Performance will be one year, with two one-year options. Forum Systems Inc., is the exclusive owner and holds distribution rights to this product. 
The Security Risk Assessment for Modernized eFile (MeF) Release 3.2 stressed the need for strong authentication and XML Threat Mitigation due to the introduction of Web services to the IRS infrastructure. In 2005, the MeF PMO tasked CSC PRIME to conduct a Product Evaluation and Selection (PES) to mitigate the new XML Threat introduced by Web services and the tool selected was the Forum Sentry XML Gateway appliance. The IRS introduced external Web services within its Enterprise Architecture (EA) in 2006 for the MeF Release 3.2 project implementation as the mechanism for the IRS transmitter user community to submit business-related tax forms directly to the IRS via application-to-application processing (A2A).   This item was subsequently added to the EA Enterprise Standards Profile (ESP) as a requirement for any external Web services implementation within the enterprise. The ESP lists Standards and Products applicable to the IRS Target Architecture and all projects are required to adhere to these standards, using only those products listed in the ESP.   No other appliance or alternative processing design can be used for Sentry processing with a major reengineering and development effort being undertaken at significant expense.
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids. The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of a non-competitive action. If parties choose to respond, responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency however, any cost associated with the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this announcement are the sole responsibility of the respondent and will not be reimbursed by the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. For specific questions, please contact Traci Brinkley, (202)-283-6889 or e-mail traci.a.brinkley@irs.gov, before 10:00 am, November 19, 2010.

<DESC>This is a notification of intent to award a sole-source follow-on construction contract to Eaton Corporation of Milwaukee, Wisconsin under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).  The contract will provide the real property required to support the Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&E) contract for microgrid research at Fort Sill, Oklahoma as described below.<BR><BR>This procurement is for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Tulsa District (SWT) to provide the electrical microgrid infrastructure (real property) to support the Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation (RDT&E) efforts of an USACE Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL) contract already competed and awarded to Eaton Corporation under contract #W9132T-10-C-0018.  The infrastructure includes a microgrid interconnection switch, paralleling switchgear, associated electrical line, and foundations for the wind turbine, battery storage, photovoltaic cells and generators.   The objective of the research efforts is to evaluate a microgrid solution to provide off-grid, islanded, electrical power, or supplemental power to a limited area on Fort Sill, Oklahoma.  Due to the highly integrated nature of the research efforts with the control systems for the microgrid interconnection switch and paralleling switchgear, the likelihood of duplicated costs and unacceptable delays to the project schedule for any contractor other than the RDT&E contractor (EATON) is expected.  Additionally, data resulting from the above-referenced contract awarded by CERL is of a proprietary nature; this data will be used before, during, and after construction of the infrastructure.  For these reasons (duplicated costs and proprietary data), the acquisition strategy for this Unspecified Minor, Military Construction, Army, effort is to award a sole-source follow-on construction contract to the RDT&E contractor (Eaton).<BR><BR>Typically, real property required to support a research effort is acquired within the research and development contract.  However, in this case the estimated cost for real property to support the microgrid project exceeds the acquisition threshold, necessitating a separate funding source and construction contract.<BR><BR>To be eligible to receive a Government contract award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. Register via the CCR internet site at: www.ccr.gov . For further questions or concerns regarding CCR, please contact CCR Assistance at 888-277-2423 Monday thru Friday 8:00am to 6:00pm (EST). <BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the Governments needs.  This synopsis shall not be considered a request for proposal.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.<BR><BR>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Firms intending to provide submittals must submit detailed information indicating their ability to meet the Governments requirements. <BR><BR>Responses to this announcement shall be submitted via email to jonathan.nadig@usace.army.mil.  Responses via fax or traditional mail will NOT be accepted.<BR><BR>All inquiries must be received by 3:00pm (CST) Wednesday, 17 November 2010.

However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists offerors may be required to submit information other than cost or pricing data to support a determination of price reasonableness.<br />3. Proposal Submission: The proposal must be complete, self-sufficient, and respond directly to the requirements of this solicitation. Format for proposals shall be as follows: Proposals will be submitted on 8.5 by 11 inch paper. Typing shall not be less than 11 pitch. Elaborate formats, binders or color presentations are not desired or required. Submit one (1) original, submission may be via email. Contractor's signature shall appear on the document. By submitting a proposal/quote, the offeror accedes to the contract terms and conditions as written in the solicitation with attachments. An SF 1449 solicitation will not be issued.<br />A. Part I: Price Proposal - <br />(1) Pricing Schedule: Fill out proposed unit and extended prices for each contract line item number (CLIN), including all option periods.<br />(2) Complete necessary fill-ins and certifications in the clauses. Ensure that you have completed the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at www.bpn.gov.<br />(3) Acknowledge all changes to the solicitation (if applicable).<br />(4) Quality Control Plan - <br />B. Part II: Past Performance Information <br />Past and Present Performance Questionnaire (Attachment 3): The offeror shall send copies of the Past and Present Performance questionnaire to between two (2) and four (4) Federal agencies or commercial companies for which the offeror has performed similar contract services within the last three (3) years (2007 to present date). The companies receiving the questionnaire shall complete the document and return the questionnaire directly to the contracting office. Note that the contracting office will NOT consider Past and Present Performance questionnaires (references) received directly from the offeror.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items.</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, will be the most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) PAST PERFORMANCE<br />(2) PRICE</p>
<p>Past Performance is significantly more important that Price when being evaluated.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Addendum to FAR 52.212-2<br />Basis for Award: This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing simplified procedures authorized by FAR 13.5, "Test Program for Certain Commercial Items." For quotations determined technically acceptable, a best value selection based on price and past performance will be made. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in provision 52.212-1, Instructions To Offerors, and this associated Addendum, the offeror accedes to the terms of this model contract and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their price and performance records . The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. Initially offers shall be ranked according to price, including option prices. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Bid Schedule by the unit price for each item to confirm the extended amount for each. Each offeror's quoted price will be evaluated for reasonableness. Price will always be an important factor; therefore, offerors should make diligent efforts to control costs and submit fairly priced quotes.</p>
<p>B. Next, the government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation using a Past and Present Performance Questionnaire (Attachment 3). Offeror must send Past and Present Performance Survey to between two and four business references; references shall either email the completed survey to amy.burke.2@us.af.mil, or fax to (302) 677-2309. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information on each offeror based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances of efforts involving that are similar or greater in scope than the effort described in this solicitation. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a "High Confidence/Exceptional" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past and present performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past and present performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of High Confidence/Exceptional, Significant Confidence/Very Good, Satisfactory Confidence/Satisfactory, Unknown Confidence/None, Little Confidence/Marginal, or No Confidence/Unsatisfactory, as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3. Past and present performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past and present performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence/None," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>C. In evaluating past and present performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>D. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "High Confidence/Exceptional" performance rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>E. In the event that the government does not make an award pursuant to paragraph E above, the government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a performance assessment rating of "Significant Confidence" or lower. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>F. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions to permit a meaningful assessment of past performance. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>G. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM to 52.228-5 -- Insurance -- Work on a Government Installation (Jan 1997)</p>
<p>(a) Workers' compensation and employer's liability. Contractors are required to comply with applicable Federal and State workers' compensation and occupational disease statutes. If occupational diseases are not compensable under those statutes, they shall be covered under the employer's liability section of the insurance policy, except when contract operations are so commingled with a contractor's commercial operations that it would not be practical to require this coverage. Employer's liability coverage of at least $100,000 shall be required, except in States with exclusive or monopolistic funds that do not permit workers' compensation to be written by private carriers. (See 28.305(c) for treatment of contracts subject to the Defense Base Act.)</p>
<p>(b) General liability.</p>
<p>1) The contracting officer shall require bodily injury liability insurance coverage written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $500,000 per occurrence.<br />2) Property damage liability insurance shall be required only in special circumstances as determined by the agency.</p>
<p>(c) Automobile liability. The contracting officer shall require automobile liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy. The policy shall provide for bodily injury and property damage liability covering the operation of all automobiles used in connection with performing the contract. Policies covering automobiles operated in the United States shall provide coverage of at least $200,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence for bodily injury and $20,000 per occurrence for property damage. The amount of liability coverage on other policies shall be commensurate with any legal requirements of the locality and sufficient to meet normal and customary claims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTEST</strong>S - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

**APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. 
Proposals received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.
 With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire.
 The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx . Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM , respectively.

<p><strong><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>On behalf of the AbilityOne Program, National Industries for the Blind (NIB), a designated central nonprofit agency of The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, is pursuing potential partnerships with U.S. commercial manufacturers of Business Sized and High Security Shredders for the purpose of providing employment for people who are blind or severely disabled. If successful, the result will be a co-brand agreement between the manufacturer and the AbilityOne Program, and its registered brands. The ultimate expectation is that the co-branded product will be placed on the&nbsp;AbilityOne Procurement List (PL).
<p>The Business Sized and High Security Shredders must meet and/or exceed FAR and other Federal Government published standards, Executive Orders and Federal Agency requirements.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the following criteria must be met:</p>
<p>1. Possession of a nationally known brand name that can be demonstrated to have significant appeal through evidence of substantial sales.<br />2. The Business Sized Paper Shredders must have equal to or better than performance standards as currently supplied under the following National Stock Numbered items:<br />7490-01-483-8984<br />7490-01-483-8985<br />7490-01-483-8990<br />7490-01-483-8991<br />7490-01-567-4337<br />7490-01-567-4338<br />7490-01-567-4338<br />The successful partner will be encouraged to expand model offerings to satisfy a majority of the business size paper shredder market.<br />3. The High Security Paper Shredders described must meet the NSA/CSS Standards 02-01 for final destruction of paper documents, and meet and/or exceed the FAR and other published Federal standards, including Executive Orders and applicable agency-unique requirements. The successful partner must offer a line of high security shredding machines to include at least 5 models. Initial development is for a medium duty and heavy duty, high security shredder in both a console office configuration and a hand carried deployable field use configuration. Additionally, a successful partner must provide a heavy duty high security shredder with an auto oiler in the console version.<br />4. The chosen manufacturer must be willing to set a high priority for delivering bulk materials to the non-profit agency in order to assure the agency of on-time deliveries to the federal government customer(s).<br />5. All products must be manufactured and lab tested, certified and customer tested to be effective according to their purpose, have current Material Safety Data sheets, if necessary, and meet certifications with corresponding documentation designated by customers.<br />6. A willingness to enter into a multi-year agreement which includes on-going technical and production assistance and the necessary factory trained technical field support while enabling the non-profit agency to meet the criteria of the AbilityOne Program to convert material, label, assemble and package the products thereby creating employment for people who are blind or severely disabled.<br />7. Commitment to working independently with the AbilityOne to market products to the Government customers under the AbilityOne Program. It is preferred that the chosen manufacturer has a dedicated team for Federal Government sales and marketing.<br />8. Willingness to work with the non-profit agency, NIB and AbilityOne to ensure that the price to the end-users is a fair and reasonable price.<br />9. Manufacturers' submissions must demonstrate that proposed products meet the various criteria, as well as indicate what functions the nonprofit agency's employees would perform. Submissions should recommend ways to maximize the employment for people who are bind or severely disabled in the fulfillment of the products.</p>

<p>Responses should be directed to the contact listed in this Notice.</p>
<p>Questions should be directed to Amy Fletcher at 703-310-0373.</p>

<DESC><p><br />*******************SOURCES SOUGHT*******************<br />************CAPABILITIES STATEMENT REQUIRED*************</p>
<p>NOTE: NACIS CODE CHANGE</p>
<p>The mission of the Air Force Office of the Civil Engineer (AF/A7C) is to provide, operate, maintain, and protect sustainable installations as weapon systems platforms across the full mission spectrum. Today AF/A7C supports approximately 166 installations worldwide that account for over 700 million square feet of facilities, more than 500 miles of runways, and some 10 million acres of land managed by approximately 66,000 civil engineers, and an annual budget exceeding $14B.</p>
<p>The Civil Engineer (CE) organization cannot achieve its mission with its current information management systems. To operate more effectively and efficiently, AF/A7C is seeking to lend greater transparency and accuracy to our decision-making and resource allocation processes. The expected outcome will be more robust, accurate, and transparent information management capabilities to produce the most effective and strategic resource allocation decisions.</p>
<p>This RFI is being provided, along with a DRAFT solicitation, to determine interest from industry in providing an Integrated Workplace Management System (IWMS) commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) IT software solution. Gartner, Inc., a leading information technology research and advisory firm defines IWMS solutions as "enterprise level software solutions that integrates four key components of functionality: project management, real estate portfolio and lease management, space management (moves, adds and changes), and maintenance management. The software operates from a single database and offers workflow tools, executive dashboards, and predefined and customized reporting capabilities." In addition, Gartner defines an IWMS as an unbundled offering from other vendor system offerings.</p>

<DESC>THIS POSTING IS BEST VIEWED AT HTTPS://FAACO.FAA.GOV, KEYWORD: WASTE DISPOSAL.
Amendment A001 issued 11/4/10 to make corrections to the SIR/RFO and to clarify this announcement to reflect anticipated award of a contract consisting of 'one 1-year base period, plus "four" 1-year option periods.'  Original announcement mistakenly stated "two" 1-year option periods.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, contemplates the acquisition of Waste Disposal/Hazardous Material Management and Emergency Response Services. 
It is anticipated that an Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type contract with firm-fixed-pricing arrangements will be awarded as a result of this solicitation.  The contract will consist of one 1-year base period, plus four 1-year option periods.    
A technical, as well as cost, evaluation will be conducted to make an award decision based on Lowest-Price/Technically Acceptable.  A description of the technical submittal and subsequent evaluation can be found in Sections L and M of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO).
This requirement is 100% set-aside for competition among small businesses.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 562211, with a small business size standard of $12.5 million.  
ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SIR/RFO MUST BE RECEIVED PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 10, 2010 FOR ANSWERS TO BE PROVIDED BEFORE THE PROPOSALS ARE DUE.
Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration, www.ccr.gov on the date established for receipt of offers, November 19, 2010.  Reference AMS Clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), "if the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."  
In addition, all contractors shall complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form with their proposals. The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  	Technical, as well as cost, proposals must be received by the FAA, Customer Service Desk (AMQ-100), 6500 S. MacArthur Boulevard, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73169, no later than 2:00 p.m. CST, November 19, 2010.  Proposals shall be delivered to Room 313 of the Multi-Purpose Building located at 6500 S. MacArthur Boulevard, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73169.  Proposals must be sealed and labeled as follows:  SIR/RFO No. DTFAAC-11-R-00016; due 2:00 p.m. CST, November 19, 2010.
ELECTRONIC OFFERORS ARE NOT AUTHORIZED.

From the responses to this market research, the Government will evaluate the viable options and select the final acquisition strategy. Therefore, your response to this research is instrumental in supporting your company's business interests. If the Contracting Officer is unable to determine that any of the above strategies would be viable, the requirement may be competed on an unrestricted basis. It is anticipated that any resulting contract would be accomplished under the provisions of a firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract. The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 333319 with a size standard of 500 Employees.

TABSS will also serve in companion to the Program Management, Administrative, Clerical and Technical Services (PACTS) contract. Although PACTS may appear to provide similar services as the TABSS Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services domain, the PACTS services are more generalized in nature. Under the TABSS vehicle, program management services are intended to meet a full range of specialized Program, Business, and Acquisition support services across multiple domains ensuring business continuity and integration. In the case of requirements overlap for a specific task order, PACTS will remain DHS' preferred vehicle.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize both unrestricted and small business set-aside award tracks. DHS intends to award a sufficient number of contracts to maintain effective competition in each of the domain tracks. There will be multiple unrestricted and Small Business award tracks, as shown below. The number of awardees per track will be determined later, and may not be uniform among tracks.<br />1. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />2. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />3. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track<br />4. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />5. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />6. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; preferred SDV Track<br />7. Contract Management Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track</p>
<p>The resulting IDIQ contract will have an ordering period of five (5) years from award.</p>
<p>A draft solicitation for this acquisition is currently planned to be released in May 2010. Interested parties will have 1-2 weeks to submit questions and comments related to this draft. These questions and comments will be addressed at an Industry Day/Pre-solicitation Conference in late May or early June 2010. DHS anticipates release of a final solicitation shortly following this event. Contractors will be provided sufficient time after solicitation relaserelease to develop and submit proposals.</p>
<p>An email address has been established for this acquisition - TABSS@USCG.MIL. Due to the large number of parties interested in this acquisition, use of email communication (sent to this address) is strongly encouraged to ensure timely response to questions.</p>
<p>This synopsis corresponds to Advance Acquisition Plan (AAP) 62889, which is posted on the DHS AAP website (https://www.fido.gov/dhs/aap/publicview.asp).</p>

<ARCHDATE>11192010
<DESC>GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION<br />JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />The Department of Veterans Affairs<br />Philadelphia, Pennsylvania <br />9PA2191<br />PROPOSED ACTION: <br />To provide for an expansion to lease LPA09460 for 11,500 usable square feet of office and related space at 4700 Wissahickon Avenue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The total amount of usable square feet of office and related space will be 18,630. The lease term will be for five years, three years firm.
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT (INCLUDING ESTIMATED VALUE): <br />The VA is currently located at the Veteran's Administration Center at 5000 Wissahickon Avenue in Philadelphia, PA. A lease was awarded to 4700 Wissahickon Avenue on May 1, 2010. The VA submitted an SF-81 to GSA on July 22, 2010 for expansion space. They have an urgent and compelling need for an additional 11,500 ANSI/BOMI office area square feet for a training facility. &lt;REDACTED&gt;. Currently, 5000 Wissahickon cannot accommodate the additional space requirement. The delineated area submitted by the VA is a .5 miles radius from their current location. This restricted delineated area is necessary due to the continuous interaction between their current Regional Office (R0) and the new training facility. Veteran's files will be transported between the two sites and all in-going and out-going mail will be handled out of RO. &lt;REDACTED&gt;. <br />The lessor provided a new shell rate for the expansion space. The lease will be amended via Supplemental Lease Agreement. The terms and conditions of the lease will remain the same (a five year lease, three year firm term) with The Philadelphia Design and Distribution Center (also known as the WIC Building) at 4700 Wissahickon Avenue, Philadelphia, PA.</p>
<p>IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY: 41 U.S.C. 253 (C) (1)<br /><br />UNIQUE QUALIFICATION OF PROPOSED CONTRACTOR OR NATURE OF ACQUISITION REQUIRING AUTHORITY CITED: <br />The VA is currently located at the Veteran's Administration Center at 5000 Wissahickon Avenue in Philadelphia, PA. The current location does not have any extra space for the additional request for space. The potential Lessor's building is located within the delineated area required by the VA and market research has shown that it is the only available building within the immediate area that would meet the VA's needs.</p>
<p>EFFORTS TO ENSURE SOLICITATION FROM MAXIMUM SOURCES PRACTICAL: <br />A &lt;REDACTED&gt; of the market for available space in the VA's delineated area were conducted. Based on those results, GSA has determined that the proposed building is the only building that can meet the VA's needs. &lt;REDACTED&gt;.</p>
<p>DETERMINATION THAT ANTICIPATED COST WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE: The anticipated cost of the expansion lease is:<br />Lease is for 5 years, 3 years firm. The TI will be amortized over the 3 year firm term at 5%.</p>
<p>Years 1-3:<br />&lt;REDACTED&gt; = approximately $1,385,526.90</p>
<p>Years 4-5:<br />&lt;REDACTED&gt;= approximately $587,114.10</p>
<p>TOTAL Aggregate Value of the Expansion = $1,972,641.00</p>
<p>Information from recent market surveys show that current market rates range from &lt;REDACTED&gt;. &lt;REDACTED&gt;. We anticipate that the rental rate for the space in question will be approximately &lt;REDACTED&gt;, which does not include the full general tenant improvement allowance. This is in line with the rates stated above. Also, the current lease was awarded for a shell rate of approximately &lt;REDACTED&gt; and an operating rate of approximately &lt;REDACTED&gt;. The lessor plans to offer the expansion space at the same operating rent of &lt;REDACTED&gt; and an increased shell rate of &lt;REDACTED&gt;. This increase accounts for converting the shell space from warehouse to office space. Further negotiations with the proposed Lessor will ensure that the agreed upon rental rate is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>OTHER FACTORS SUPPORTING JUSTIFICATION: <br />FAR 6.302-1(A)(ii)(B) states that circumstances permitting other than full and open competition include situations that would cause "unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements". Therefore, to avoid delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements, the most sound business decision for this agency is to pursue an expansion to the lease at 4700 Wissahickon Avenue because the lessor has available space on the same floor, across the hall, and the design for the overall requirement of 18,630 USF (21,052 USF) will be completed concurrently. The overall initiative is to work quickly toward the VA's occupancy. Also, the agency has requested that the project has a quick term around time and requires occupancy in early 2011.</p>
<p>LISTING SOURCES EXPRESSING INTEREST IN BEING SOLICITED: <br />&lt;REDACTED&gt;</p>
<p>FUTURE ACTION TO OVERCOME BARRIERS TO FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: The current housing plan is to complete a sole source action for the additional 11,500 ANSI/BOMI square feet of space for a 3 year firm term, 5 year term. As we near the expiration date of the proposed lease, GSA will re-evaluate the VA's space needs and other available options and either relocate this training center to the federally owned Veteran's Administration Center or engage in a competitive lease action.</p>
