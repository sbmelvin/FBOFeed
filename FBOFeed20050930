Subject:  	Pre-solicitation Notice to the Water Sector Institutional Capacity 
Building Program (WIC) RFP


Dear prospective bidders:

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in West Bank and Gaza intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP), to implement the program described below. The new Water Sector Institutional Capacity Building Program (WIC) is designed to provide a mechanism that responds to critical needs in the Palestinian water sector to improve the capacity of water sector institutions to operate and maintain water systems in the West Bank and to build broad-based public support for reducing unaccounted for water losses, adopting water conservation practices, and achieving cost recovery.  The WIC program will provide training and critically needed commodities to the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA), the West Bank Water Department (WBWD), Joint Services Councils (JSC), and local governments in the West Bank.

The goals and purpose of the WIC program will be achieved through four activities: 

(1) Provide hands-on training to the PWA, the WBWD, JSCs, and local governments in order to repair, maintain, and expand water and wastewater infrastructure (wells, pumps, distribution and collection networks, water treatment and wastewater treatment plants); 

(2) Achieve cost recovery through better management of revenue streams; 

(3) Improve water productivity through reducing leakage, other sources of unaccounted-for water losses, and promoting water conservation best practices and technologies; and, 

(4) Develop strategic plans for eventual regional integration of water and wastewater services.  In addition to technical assistance, this RFP requires procurement of substantial amounts of commodities in the form of replacement pipes, meters, pumps, vehicles, and other equipment needed for urgent repairs to aging and damaged water systems throughout the West Bank.  Due to the critical lack of financial resources in the water sector, West Bank water service providers will be unable to implement repairs to their systems unless these commodities are provided in conjunction with necessary hands-on training.  



U.S. Agency for International Development
American Embassy
71, Hayarkon St.	
Tel Aviv 63903

This RFP pertains specifically to all four activities of the WIC program listed above. One direct cost plus fixed fee contract will be awarded for implementation of all these four activities. There will be Grants under Contracts (GUCS) component under the program and Information technology equipment may be procured as part of this project. Prospective offerors are encouraged to include qualified Palestinian sub-contractors.     Implementation under the contract will occur over three years. The work conducted under the Contract awarded through this RFP will be integrated with implementation mechanisms for other activities under the Water Resources and Infrastructure Office.     

The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (www.fedbizopps.gov). In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. It is the responsibility of the recipient of this solicitation to ensure that it has been received in its entirety and USAID bears no responsibility for data error resulting from this transmission. Requests for other copies of the solicitation will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. 

Questions must be directed to Ms. Hourig DelDelian, Sr. Contract Specialist, U.S. Agency for International Development, email: hdeldelian@usaid.gov , fax no. (972-3-511-4893). USAID/West Bank and Gaza anticipates issuing the RFP o/a October 20, 2005. 

A pre-proposal conference will be held shortly thereafter, with specifics to be addressed in the RFP.                                   

In an effort to be as transparent as possible the following information is provided.  USAID originally attempted to procure these services through an RFP under the General Services Administration (GSA) schedule contracts (MOBIS).  The MOBIS RFP statement of work (attached) is essentially the same as the statement of work we will be using for this RFP to be issued o/a October 20, 2005.  The MOBIS RFP was issued on July 15, 2005 to eight firms and cancelled on August 11, 2005 after a determination was made that the statement of work was inappropriate for procuring under the MOBIS contracts. 
 
In order to facilitate teaming arrangements, firms are requested to notify Ms. DelDelian of the firm name, address, point of contact person and email address, which will be included in a list of interested firms as an attachment to the RFP. 


							Sincerely,
                                                        /S/

<DESC>SUBJECT

Request for Information (RFI) for a Procurement List Information Management System (PLIMS) 

Responses are due to this RFI by 4:00 PM on October 14th, 2005.  See section 5.0 for further information.


Background
The Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (¡§The Committee¡¨) seeks to contract the services of an organization willing and capable to develop the next generation of their PLIMS.  This system is the primary information and decision processing system utilized by The Committee to perform its functions under the auspices of the Javits-Wagner-O¡¦Day (JWOD) Act [41 U.S.C. 46-48c].  This document serves as an introduction to the requirements of this system.  It should enable organizations to decide whether their capabilities are sufficient to perform the tasks under the expected contract.

The application architecture supporting the JWOD Program consists of a few automated systems and many spreadsheets and manual files. 

The primary automated system in use by Committee Staff is the JWOD Program Information Database (JPID). JPID is augmented by an external Master File/List. An extract from JPID is made to populate the Procurement List (PL) database that is provided on the Internet via the JWOD.GOV website.

Many of the processes supporting the JWOD Program are semi-automated; that is, they are supported by the use of office automation tools such as e-mail, spreadsheets, and facsimile submissions rather than institutionalized automated systems.  The expected procurement from this RFI is for a solution that will replace the current JPID and include the new capabilities outlined below.


1.0	REQUIREMENTS

The PLIMS is anticipated to involve custom development along with integration of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software for workflow management, document management, security and authentication, and other common business practices. The complexity of transactions in the Committee¡¦s business processes suggest that it will be suitable for prototyping some functions using state-of-the-art tools for automating data exchange, forms and electronic signatures. The existing data in the current PLIMS, known as JPID shall be converted. A data analysis and cleanup process has begun, reconciling data between the Committee¡¦s systems and the Central Non-Profit Agency (CNA) systems but additional data analysis and conversion to the new system will be required.

The PLIMS, as it is expected to be developed, will fulfill six objectives:
1.	Provide decision tracking support for Committee and Committee Staff;
2.	Improve data integrity across the program;
3.	Reduce redundant work and duplicate data entry
4.	Improve transparency of procurement processes;
5.	Provide project level visibility; and
6.	Maintain security, integrity, and accessibility.

Extensive analysis has already been performed to develop a detailed Requirements Document for the PLIMS.  The list below summarizes the key requirements from that document.  At a minimum, the system to be developed must support the following functional areas:
„«	Non-Profit Agency Qualification and Management
„«	Impact
„«	Contracting Activity Interactions
„«	PL Transactions with the CNAs
„«	Committee Staff Workflow
„«	Federal Register, with electronic submission capabilities
„«	Voting
„«	Pricing
„«	Program Oversight
„«	Distribution
Details on these functional areas will be provided in the Request for Proposal (RFP) document to be issued at a later date.

The Committee¡¦s PLIMS will reside on the Committee¡¦s access-controlled extranet.  The system will include functions for managing the pipeline of additions to, changes to, and deletions from the Procurement List, including supporting Committee member voting, oversight of Non-Profit Agencies (NPAs) participation in the JWOD Program, and portals for Committee members, Contracting Activities (CAs) and distributors.  The current concept is for many of the PL Management functions to be supported through a combination of COTS workflow and electronic forms software, coupled with custom web application development.  Functions that do not need controlled access (such as access to the Procurement List) will be available over the public JWOD.GOV web site.  It is expected that the PLIMS developed for the Committee will use component architecture, possibly as web services and XML transactions.  Consideration will be given to acquisition of existing Government applications (Government-off-the-shelf, GOTS) and/or COTS applications, where appropriate, that will need to be integrated.  The underlying database will be SQL Server and will be shared across the Committee¡¦s applications. 

Particular areas in which COTS or GOTS applications may be appropriate include workflow management, document management, voting, executive information system (EIS), on-line analytical processing (OLAP), and report writing tools.  Additional market research may reveal others and help shape the requirement.  Although the intent is that any COTS or GOTS components fit well into the architecture expected to be used by the new system, compromises may be made if the component is an excellent fit from a business perspective.  If necessary, customization of GOTS/COTS components will be accepted as long as these customizations are not substantial or unrelated to the specific requirements of the PLIMS.  It is probable that some applications may need the capability to accept incoming e-mail messages from program participants and retain them, associating them with specific PLIMS transactions.

The target physical architecture for this application (or suite of applications) is an architecture that is web-enabled and accessible to program stakeholders and participants, forming interlinked extranets at the Committee and the CNAs.  Security and access control will become paramount due to the exposure inherent in this connectivity.  In addition, authentication architecture will be put in place to allow program participants to electronically sign transactions.  CAs, CNAs, and NPAs will certify PL transactions.  CNAs and NPAs will also electronically sign other transactions such as quarterly and annual reports.

Individual data repositories will be owned by the Committee, the National Industries for the Blind (NIB), and/or NISH, located on their individual extranets, and administered by the owning organization.  Each organization will also maintain its public website and its internal intranet.  The Committee will deploy the PLIMS through its extranet.

This is a relatively small, yet vital information technology solution.  The expected size and scale of the system is not expected to exceed 50 simultaneous users and is projected not to exceed 500 MB for storage requirements.  Current statistics have not more than 29 simultaneous users and approximately 100MB of storage.

Guidelines for Hardware and Software 
The following summarizes the expected hardware and software configurations of the underlying physical architecture of the new PLIMS:
„«	To the degree possible, standard COTS tools are preferred.
„«	The web server must be compatible with a windows platform.  No media servers are currently anticipated. 
„«	The application servers will be ASP.NET, J2EE, Cold Fusion or similar.
„«	Requirements will be tracked and managed using a requirements management tool such as CORE to assist in the development of requirements specifications, provide traceability of requirements changes and determination of the impact of potential requirements changes.
„«	The Unified Modeling Language (UML) will be used to model and iteratively design the applications.
„«	An integrated development environment (IDE) will be used to develop the portions of the application that are not COTS or GOTS. 
„«	The application will be developed under configuration management, using a configuration management tool.
„«	Test management will include functionality testing, end-to-end use case testing, usability/ accessibility testing, security testing, performance testing of system response and transaction rates, and load/volume/stress testing.
„«	The database to be used will be Microsoft SQL Server, which is the database currently in use at the Committee.
„«	Static display of information will be accomplished using standard Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).  
„«	The development languages have not yet been determined, but may include C#, ASP.NET, CFML, Java, Visual Basic.NET and Javascript. 
„«	Extensible Markup Language (XML) will be used for data interoperability.
„«	MS Office Applications are the standard work productivity tools.
„«	Data interchange will be accomplished using XML and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP).
„«	SOAP will provide the mechanism for HTTP/XML based remote procedure calls for web services.
„«	Online Analytical Processing tools or report writers will be required.  These may be acquired as COTS applications or implemented using XML for analysis, which uses SOAP to enable the web browser to access XML data.  It can be used to create OLAP-type applications for use over the web.
„«	Section 508 compliance is required.

<SUBJECT>Z -- Provide Electrical Bonding for 117 Bldgs on Hill AFB and Little Mountain
<SOLNBR>FA8201-05-B-0001
<RESPDATE>120904
<CONTACT>Clare Wang, Contract Negotiator, Phone 801-586-6637, Email clare.wang@hill.af.mil
<DESC>APPROXIMATE ISSUE DATE: 9 Nov 04
This project is to provide the bonding required between the electrical system ground and the lightning protection ground bus bar as required in NFPA 780 Paragraph 3.14.2. This project includes 117 buildingsOne hundred and eleven (111) buildings are in “Controlled” areas on Hill Air Force Base and six (6) are at the Little Mountain facility.
The installed grounding bus bar for each building is mounted ‘close’ to where the building electrical service equipment is mounted. Each building will be different but there are two basic types of buildings; one with the electrical service and grounding bus bar mounted inside and the other type with the electrical service and grounding bus bar mounted outside. The grounding bus bar is 12 inches long, 4 inches high, and ¼ inch thick. There are 5 sets of mounting holes for cable connectors. Each set of mounting holes has 3 holes; with two holes 1 inch center to center and the other holes ¾ entrance cabinet and at least every 5 feet in between. All support clamps used outside will be either stainless steel or UL rated for exterior use with copper conductors. 
The buildings with the grounding bus bar mounted inside do not have the 4/0 cable from the lightning protection system connected to the grounding bus bar. In every one of these buildings the contractor shall provide a 4/0 compression connector for connecting to the grounding bus bar. Exothermic connectors are not allowed for this case because the exothermic reaction would have to take place inside a building with hazardous materials. Contractor will also be required to fill in the hole into the building where the 4/0 AWG grounding conductor comes through the wall. Contractor shall clean any debris from the hole and use clear silicone sealant to neatly fill in the space (both sides of the wall) around the cable.  For entrance into the electrical system cabinet, the contractor shall either use a knock out into the service entrance cabinet or drill a hole for entrance. The contractor shall use appropriate safety procedures when working in the electrical service cabinet to ensure safety of personnel and equipment. Contractor shall provide a plastic bushing to protect the conductor from the metal cabinet. After installation of grounding conductor through bushing, the contractor shall seal the bushing with clear silicon sealant around the conductor. The contractor shall connect the grounding conductor to the ground bus in the electrical system service entrance cabinet. Contractor shall provide and install lug on end of cable as required to make the connection to the existing, grounding bus.  All hardware for outside work will be stainless steel. Connection to the mounted grounding bus bar (See Item 2) will be made with a 3/8 inch stainless steel bolt, nut, 2 flat washers, and split lock washer for each of the two holes. All equipment used will be UL or FM labeled. All work will be done in a workmanlike manner. Conductor runs will be parallel or perpendicular to building lines. Contractor will clear up all debris caused by this project. Contractor will provide and install any miscellaneous items or materials for a complete and functioning project.  All of the buildings in the project do not have their lightning protection installed yet. As of February 1, 2004 there are about 75 buildings complete. The rest should be completed by July 2004. Contractor may be held up somewhat waiting for lightning protection to be installed on some buildings. Contractor will not be held responsible for delays caused by lightning installation contractor.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a single source purchase order, using FAR Part 13 procedures, to modify and improve the EPA's current version of TOPMODEL-GEM developed by the Georgia Institute of Technology.  EPA believes that the Georgia Institute of Technology is the only reasonably available source capable of satisfying the Government's requirements as stated below.  The circumstance permitting soliciting from a single source is FAR 13.106-1(b), "...contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting  officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available..."The improvement to the TOPMODEL-GEM will specifically address the down-slope transport of water and nitrogen (N) through the unsaturated (near surface) zone of soils and the dynamics and  interaction of the saturated and unsaturated zones, specifically (1) the content and movement of water within multiple soil layers and (2) the content and movement of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN, as nitrate and ammonium) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON in water within each soil layers,  and (3) partitioning of the dissolved N between sorbed and dissolved forms.  The improved model shall  also explicitly include state variables for each soil layer for both DIN and DON and a texture-dependent constant for partitioning these between sorbed and dissolved forms.    The program code for  the integrated TOPMODEL-GEM will be written in MATLAB.  The model shall include interactions among water and nutrient (carbon and nitrogen) cycles in vegetation and soils, at spatial and temporal scales ranging from stands to watersheds and days to centuries.  The program design shall accommodate  spatially-distributed applications that simulate topographic controls on water and nutrient transport in a variety of terrains, including the Central Plains and Cascade Range of the Pacific Northwest.   The successful offeror will be required to demonstrate its quality assurance (QA) capability to  conform to ANSI/ASQCE4 and EPA Order 5360.1 A2.   For more information on these QA requirements visit: ttp://www.epa.gov/QUALITY/faq4.html.   Interested persons seeking to challenge the single source justification must present, in writing, clear and convincing evidence of their capability to  provide the requirements within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice along with pricing  information that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  Period of performance is expected to be approximately one year from award of the purchase order.  No Request  for Quote is available.

Sri Lanka Strategic Advisory and ICT Systems Technical Assistance.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance for the implementation of operations center design, procedures and best practices, and to recommend strategies for improved emergency warning communications for the Disaster Management Center (DMC).

The DMC has been designated as the national command center for emergency communications.  It will coordinate data and analysis in near real-time from each of the Sri Lankan government’s technical departments and agencies, determine the national response strategy to emergencies, and serve as the central point of dissemination for crisis information.  DMC will have a small staff trained to respond to expert assessments made by the line agencies.  It will not replicate specialized interpretative skills found in other departments.  The DMC has no ICT infrastructure in place today.  The DMC needs Assistance to establish the overall strategy and framework for the Center, define best practices and operating procedures, and evaluate options for emergency communications and notification.  

The recommended scope of the DMC Technical Assistance project is comprised of three inter-related components: Warning Center Best Practices; Communications and Notification; ICT Strategy and Core Systems.  Further, the strategies and systems proposed will be crafted to support and “all hazards’ approach”.  

The specific outcomes of the project will be to:
1.	Define a strategic roadmap for DMC, including operational priorities, organizational structure, staff training requirements and budgets;
2.	Consolidate national management for ‘all hazard’ disaster management;
3.	Develop standard operating procedures for the Center; 
4.	Propose an optimal disaster management information processing architecture;
5.	Evaluate communications and public notification solutions, and propose alternatives and potential financing scenarios;
6.	Significantly reduce public response time from the moment of identification of a hazard, and;
7.	Ensure that DMC staff is properly trained on new systems and operating center best practices.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $375,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.

Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.

<DESC>1.  Introduction:  The government has identified a clear need for an enterprise-wide collaboration service to become part of Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES).  Based on a collaboration service pilot, the government has further refined requirements and gathered lessons learned.  At this point the government is preparing an RFQ to procure this service from industry.  It is the government’s intent to award to more than one vendor and procure existing commercial services with proven history utilizing an incentive structure that fosters the most competitive environment for meeting user requirements and expectations, and maintaining the DoD at the forefront of commercial product upgrades and innovations.   In order to ensure the acquisition of the best possible solutions, the government is releasing this Request for Information (RFI) to industry to both alert industry to the impending Request for Quotes (RFQ) release as well as to solicit specific information so the government can best prepare the RFQ.
For the purpose of this RFI, the term vendor may refer to a single entity or two or more companies with an established relationship designed to deliver a single collaboration service to the government.  
2.  Background:  Interested vendors should reference the draft SOO that will compose part of the planned RFQ.  The draft SOO is located at: https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  This SOO is provided to help prepare industry as well as to solicit industry feedback.  The final SOO will incorporate both internal government-generated comments as well as feedback received from this RFI.  All RFI responses are due no later than 2359 (1159PM) EDT 14 October 2005.  It is requested that responses be limited to 15 pages.
3.  Industry Day:  In order to facilitate communication between the government and industry, an industry day is planned.  Attendance at the industry day is optional and will have no bearing on an vendor’s ability to bid on any future solicitation.  However, based on responses to this RFI, some vendors may be invited to a one-on-one session with the government to further discuss responses, products, and concerns.  Any one-on-one sessions the government hosts will be held in the days following this industry day.
3.1.  Date/Time:  24 October 2005, 1300-1600 (1 to 4 PM) EDT.  
3.2.  Location:  DISA Sky 7, Room 1N47, 5275 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, VA 22041.  3.3.  POC:  LT Giancarlo Rossi, 703-882-1569 (DSN 381-1569), Giancarlo.Rossi@disa.mil.  3.4.  Registration Information:  Participants interested in attending industry day must contact the POC by 1600 (4 PM) EDT 12 October 2005.  The vendor’s party size is limited to four (4) individuals due to room size limitations.  
3.5.  Security:  When entering the building, follow signs to your left for visitors.  All attendees should expect to pass through a metal detector and have any bags X-rayed.  Attendees must then present a picture ID and sign-in at the front desk.
4.  Questions:  Responses to this RFI should address the following questions.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The current proposal will allow for the incorporation of a Liquid Quick Disconnect Connector (LQDC) to future orders fo r the MCG, as well as the retrofit of approximately 1,684 MCGs already purchased without LQDCs. The proposed Sole Source acquisition from Med-Eng Inc., 837 Commerce Park Drive, Ogdensburn, New York, 13669-2209 is required because the LQDC is the only quick  disconnect which has been fully tested and has been fully approved for air worthiness release for the Air Warrior Microclimate Cooling System (MCS).  There is no other manufacturer with a fully tested and qualified liquid disconnect satisfying all of the Air Warrior MCS requirements.  See Med-Eng Inc., for subcontracting opportunity.   There are no solicitation package or technical drawing available for this acquisition.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has a requirement for Economic Growth, Agriculture, and Trade international activities. The resulting suite of contracts will be called General, Business, Trade, and Investment II (GBTI II). The USAID Bureau for Economic Growth and Trade (EGAT) is dedicated to reducing poverty and promoting prosperity in developing and transition countries.  EGAT is the USAID operational unit with a mandate to address development issues in economic growth, agriculture and trade in the developing world. Economic Growth (EG) is an office within EGAT, mandated to assist USAID field offices to develop and implement economic growth programs. EGATs goals are to raise incomes, end hunger, protect the environment, and equip institutions and people with the knowledge and skills to build equitable and sustainable economies and societies. USAIDs primary program objectives focus on devising and implementing robust strategies to promote real economic growth, reduce poverty, graduate transitional countries from aid to trade, promote open and competitive markets, develop the private sector, and expand and mobilize private financing sources to supplement and eventually replace development assistance.  Contractors shall be expected to provide a full range of services to USAID Missions and to USAID/Washington in substantially all major areas of business, trade, and investment development and reform.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has a requirement for Economic Growth, Agriculture, and Trade international activities. The resulting suite of contracts will be called General, Business, Trade, and Investment II (GBTI II). The USAID Bureau for Economic Growth and Trade (EGAT) is dedicated to reducing poverty and promoting prosperity in developing and transition countries.  EGAT is the USAID operational unit with a mandate to address development issues in economic growth, agriculture and trade in the developing world. Economic Growth (EG) is an office within EGAT, mandated to assist USAID field offices to develop and implement economic growth programs. EGATs goals are to raise incomes, end hunger, protect the environment, and equip institutions and people with the knowledge and skills to build equitable and sustainable economies and societies. USAIDs primary program objectives focus on devising and implementing robust strategies to promote real economic growth, reduce poverty, graduate transitional countries from aid to trade, promote open and competitive markets, develop the private sector, and expand and mobilize private financing sources to supplement and eventually replace development assistance.  Contractors shall be expected to provide a full range of services to USAID Missions and to USAID/Washington in substantially all major areas of business, trade, and investment development and reform. USAID intends on awarding several Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQCs) through an unrestricted and restricted (small-business set-aside) best-value competition.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to answer the following questions: Q. This particular unit has both an IP(H.323) and an ISDN PRI (H.320) communications interface port.  When this unit is installed and connected to an ISDN telephone service, a CSU is required.  Is the telephone service going to come with it's own CSU, or should we provide one? A.	No CSU is required since we use BRI ISDN lines (not PRI ISDN).   Q. Is the customer interested in just remote maintenance which includes telephone support, software updates, and replacement parts, or would the  customer prefer an on-site maintenance service support plan that includes a  Tandberg trained engineer on-site, the next day,  to restore  the system? A.	Onsite, next day Tandberg engineer support service is not needed.  We  would require the remote support, software updates, replacement parts. Q. Are we required to integrate the VTC system with an external encryption  device?       A. No integration with external encryption device is required. Q. Is this VTC unit replacing an existing system?       A. Not replacing existing VTC. Q. Will the unit be located close enough to the ISDN termination point to use  the included cables?       A. The included Cables on the unit are long enough to reach to reach the  ISDN termination point.

<DESC>Update 30 Sep 2005 - Original Sources Sought Announcement Due to size restrictions for announcements posted on FedBizzOpps, the original  Sources Sought text that was located below the updates has been moved to a  Word document located in the library. ************************************************************************ Update 29 Sep 2005 - Organizational Conflict of Interest The Contracting Officer has found that the potential for OCI is a significant  concern for successful performance of the XR-SIMAF Capabilities Integration  Services contract(s) and therefore the OCI clause has been re-drafted to  reflect this concern. OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria will address  the OCI issue in the draft Request for Proposal (dRFP) and any resulting  contract(s). Further, in source selection the potential for OCI will be  considered in the determination of which proposal offers the best value to  the Government.   The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted OCI  clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below. *********************************************************************** Update 16 Sep 2005 - Small Business Size Standard Update The upcoming competition for the XR-SIMAF services acquisition will require  offerors to submit robust small business subcontracting goals for services  that involve a high level of complex skill sets.  The NAICS code of 541710  remains the same  however the size standard for small businesses in this  acquisition (briefed on 14 June 2005 at Industry Days) has been raised to  1,000 employees. The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000  however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500 employees.  The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of 500 could  overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust subcontracting  plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses that could provide  support for this acquisition and artificially reduce subcontracting goals.   Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small business base for this  acquisition and facilitate stronger small business participation, the size  standard for small businesses in this acquisition has been raised to 1,000  employees.  This determination has been coordinated and approved by the ASC  Small Business and the Small Business Administration offices. ********************************************************************** Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed on 8  July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at the  Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was determined that  this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business (SB)Set-Aside.  The SB  strategy under consideration will require offers to provide aggressive small  business subcontracting participation in any proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the Acquisition Plan, we  will consider up to two awards for consolidated Function Areas A, B, C and E  under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best Value Source Selection decision).  Area D may be made as a stand alone award or combined with an A-B-C-E award.   Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that  will be addressed in a tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be  posted to PIXS in the next two weeks.   The anticipated release of the dRFP is sliding by 45 days to late Sept 2005.  Industry will have 30 days to comment on the draft RFP. Release of the formal  RFP may slide by 45 days until late November 05 with proposals due early Jan  06. Award is contemplated late April 06.  A new attachment (Schedule_18_Aug_05.ppt) has been added showing the projected  schedule for this effort. ********************************************************************** Update 8 July 2005:  Third set of Industry Day questions and answers has been  added to the  library (scroll below).  Questions were received during one on one interview  sessions June 15, 2005.  ********************************************************************* Update:  Second set of answers to questions and Industry Day POCs - 24 June  2005 Questions were received prior to Industry Day regarding CMMI and current  contractors working in SIMAF.  A request was also received for contact  information of companies participating in Industry Days.  Both have been added  to the library (scroll below). We are working on questions received during Industry Day and anticipate  posting  answers by 6 July 2005. *************************************************************   Update: Upload of Industry Day Files - 15 Jun 05 Files briefed at the 14 Jun 05 Industry Day have been uploaded to the PIXS  library.  ********************************************************* Update: Extension of SOC Submittal Date + Industry Day briefings - 14 Jun 05 During the Industry Day held today, it was determined that the submittal of  the Statement of Capability (SOC), originally due on Friday June 17th will be  extended to 1600 (EST) Wed June 22nd. Several Questions were asked about the  SOC and the SOC format. For clarity the following infromation is provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple Functions QUESTION:  Because the standard business practices, company past performance and  responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR requirements/restrictions will be the same  for all functional areas, would it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a  cover letter with separate attachments; one containing the common company data  and then attachments that address each functional area separately?  ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions  being proposed may be grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a  package. Common or repeated information may be referred to from another  function area SOC, however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will be acceptable, however.  Cover Page - Firms are allowed to submit a one page cover page that may  contain business information and details like business size and CAGE code,  etc. The cover page does not count towards the 5 pages per function.  Submittal of SOC via e-mail QUESTION: Will it be acceptable to submit the SOC via email?  ANSWER: Yes, e-mail submittal is acceptable. Please  allow up to an hour for e- mail delivery incase of low band-width at WPAFB. Submit all electronic SOC  submittals  to Patricia Krabacher, patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil. The PCO  will confirm receipt of the SOC. Availability of Industry Day Briefings QUESTION: Will the 14 June 05 XR-SIMAF Industry Day briefings be made available to  industry via PIXS, or via a CD and when? ANSWER: The 14 June Industry Day briefings will be loaded to PIXS and will  available for download by COB 15 Jun 05. ****************************************************************************** Update:  Posting of Improved Labor-Hour Estimate -- 7 June 2005 The following sentences have been modified in the following synopsis to  reflect an improved estimate of labor hours for this effort: FROM...

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, on behalf of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis for a 18-month contract with WE Upjohn Institute for Employment Research (Upjohn).  Upjohn will conduct a study to examine the extent to which former Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients across a number of states apply for and receive unemployment insurance (UI) benefits upon losing their jobs, as well as the reasons for disqualification among those whose applications were denied.  The analysis will also show the link between UI benefit receipt and TANF recidivism, and among state-level trends in unemployment, UI and TANF caseloads.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Upjohn is the only entity with access to the needed data and, is therefore, the only entity capable of performing the study within the required timeframe.  The study will require the use of administrative data with sufficient detail to analyze UI benefit application, receipt and denial.  The data must also contain sufficient observations to track the subgroup of former TANF families who have subsequently lost their jobs and then experienced a variety of UI benefit outcomes.  This necessitates the use of longitudinally-linked administrative records to combine files from the TANF and UI programs, as no existing survey data meets these needs.  Because program parameters for both TANF and UI vary across states, having data that represents more than a single state is crucial to the study.  Currently there is only one source of administrative data that combines records on both TANF and UI program participation across more than one state.  These data are maintained by the Administrative Data Research and Evaluation Alliance (ADARE).  ADARE was established by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) for the purpose of addressing the lack of interstate data.  ADARE is a consortium of nine state employment security agencies (ESAs) and, for each ESA, there is a research institute partner that is officially affiliated with that ESA for purposes of employment data processing.  The data are not available to the public, nor can they be analyzed by any entity outside of the ADARE consortium.  Within the ADARE consortium, each partner has been assigned the lead on a particular set of issues and associated data.  Upjohn is the partner that has been designated by the ADARE consortium and the DOL to analyze data pertaining to UI benefits.  Vendors who are interested in this acquisition must demonstrate in writing that they can meet the Government’s requirement within 45 days from the date of publication.  Responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to satisfy the stated requirements.  Failure to submit adequate documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a sole-source award to Upjohn.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The NAICS code is 541720.  See Numbered Note 22.

<SUBJECT>99--Spools for Electrical Power Distribution Cables
<SOLNBR>M67854SPOOLS
<RESPDATE>111605
<CONTACT>Gabrielle Trickett, Tel: 703-432-3616
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, Virginia is seeking sources and information for small and large spools for storage, handling, and transportation of electrical power distribution cables.  The reusable spools for electrical power distribution cables will be used to store, handle, and transport various reusable electrical power distribution cables of differing types.  The spools shall be manufactured to withstand rough handling, unprotected outdoor storage and environmental exposure, and transportation as loose cargo both empty and when wound with cable. The Marine Corps Systems Command envisions procurement of up to 4,500 small and 2,500 large spools over a 5-year period.  General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) is the preferred method for these supplies.  Commercial firms capable of meeting this requirement are encouraged to submit the following: (1) a description of their manufacturing capability, to include product brochures and statement of capabilities; (2) rough order magnitude price for 4,500 small and 2,500 large spools; (3) detailed material specification and data showing compliance with Government needs; (4) delivery timetable for completion and delivery of 3 small and 3 large spools; (6) delivery timetable for completion and delivery 4,500 small and 2,500 large spools; (7) price breaks for quantity orders (above and below the quantity of 4,500 small and 2,500 large spools); and (8) current GSA contract information regarding unit pricing and discounts and any existing federal purchase s!  chedules the vendor is currently covered by or that can facilitate rapid purchase methods.  It is desired that spools be offered for continuous sale with established price and delivery schedules.  Multiple unit purchase discounts may be offered, but the vendor is encouraged to offer small lot purchase flexibility so that the USMC may purchase additional items on short notice.  Vendor information received on or before the response date listed above will be evaluated as potentially capable of fulfilling the Government’s requirements.  The Marine Corps Systems Command may  procure sample spools from multiple vendors for evaluation.  Interested vendors should submit pricing and delivery information for three large and small spools that the Marine Corps Systems Command can procure via credit card purchase or purchase order.  First item evaluation will validate the following technical specifications. Technical specifications are as follows: Part A – General technical specifications: 	A.1.	Physical configuration.  The cable spools shall be cylindrical in overall shape and capable of rolling when standing on edge.  They shall have either a hole or hollow shaft at the center of the spool to allow the spool to be suspended using a rod (rod is not part of the spools) through the axis of the spool.  Spools should have no moving parts. 	A.2.	Stackability.  The cable spools shall be capable of being stacked on top of one another (when on end), either with or without cable on the spools.  Spools must interlock to keep the spools stacked securely.  Small and large cable spools must be compatible with each other in the same stack. 	A.3.	Durability.  Spools must be constructed to perform their intended function of storage, handling, and transportation of reusable electrical power distribution cables for 15 years.  Mission requirements include transportation as loose cargo in military vehicles both when empty and when wound with cable.  This is a critical performance parameter. 	A.4.	Corrosion resistance.  Spools must be constructed of corrosion resistant materials capable of withstanding continuous, exposed, outdoor storage and rough handling even when surface finishes are damaged.  This is a critical performance parameter. 	A.5.	Sunlight exposure.  Spools must withstand continuous sunlight exposure from outdoor storage for 15 years without degradation.  This is a critical performance parameter. 	A.5.	Color.  Spools shall be either olive drab green, coyote brown, or flat black.  Small and large spools shall be the same color. 	A.6.	Materials.  All materials must be self-extinguishing and fire resistant. 	A.7.	Materials.  No wood will be used in the spools. 	A.8.	Materials.  All materials must not absorb or retain water and must not support fungus or mold growth. 	A.9.	Temperature.  Spools shall operate at an ambient temperature from -40 F (-40 C) to 160 F (71 C).  Spools must also operate at 135 F (57 C) with full solar loading.  This is a critical performance parameter. 	A.10.	Steam and water jet cleaning.  Spools (without cables) shall withstand cleaning with high pressure steam or water jet cleaner compatible to P-C-437 without deterioration, damage, or corrosion to the spool or surface finish. Part B – Small cable spool specifications: 	B.1.	Size.  The small cable spool shall have an approximate diameter of 30 in, approximate height of 11 in, and an approximate hub diameter of 15 in. 	B.2.	Weight (spool only).  The small cable spool shall weigh 15 lbs or less. 	B.3.	Capacity.  The small cable spool shall be appropriately sized to store and transport a cable set made up of five 25 ft single-conductor 4/0 PPE cables with cam-type connectors.  This is a critical performance parameter. 	B.4.	Drop resistance (spool only).  The small cable spool shall be capable of resisting a 4 ft drop onto a concrete surface in any orientation without structural damage.  Cosmetic damage is acceptable, but failure of welds or fasteners or major deformation (preventing rolling, stacking, etc) is unacceptable.  This is a critical performance parameter. 	B.5.	Drop resistance (with cable).  The small cable spool shall be capable of resisting a 4 ft drop onto a concrete surface both on edge and on sides while wound with the cable described in B.3.  Cosmetic damage is acceptable, but failure of welds or fasteners or major deformation (preventing rolling, stacking, etc) is unacceptable. Part C – Large cable spool specifications: 	C.1.	Size.  The large cable spool shall have an approximate diameter the same as the small cable spool, approximate height twice that of the small cable spool, and an approximate hub diameter the same as the small cable spool. 	C.2.	Weight (spool only).  The large cable spool shall weigh 30 lbs or less. 	C.3.	Capacity.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) being released by the Naval Inventory Control Point Mechanicsburg (NAVICP) Information Management/Information Technology Contracting Department on behalf of the Department of Defense (DoD), Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), and Access Card Office (ACO).  This RFI is issued for planning purposes and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Defense (DoD), Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), or the Access Card Office (ACO) to acquire any products or services.  At the time of any RFP, a Government contracting office shall issue it.  The DoD does not intend to pay for the information requested, but does consider the response to this RFI to be an indication that specific products will be offered for any subsequent RFP.  All information provided is for government planning use only.  If proprietary information is provided, please mark as “Proprietary for Government Us!  e Only”.   Purpose:   The purpose of this RFI to request comments from the smart card industry about existing or planned products that will be available to meet the needs of the DoD CAC program.  The notice provides roadmap information for DoD smart card product technical refresh through CY2006.   The DoD is requesting the following information: 1) Whether there are existing or planned products that will meet the basic requirements established below; 2) Information regarding the characteristics of the card products (specific Java VM and/or Global Platform versions, functional capabilities, available EEPROM, etc.); 3) The month and year the products are expected to be available; 4) The Answer to Reset (ATR) of the products (if available);  5) Expected changes that may be required of products to meet the FIPS 201, and; 6) Information about any contract vehicles currently being used to provide products to the DoD. The following provides the roadmap information for DoD smart card product technical refresh through CY2006. Target Date:  Present through April 2006 – DoD will purchase card stock that is currently qualified in the DoD infrastructure.  This cardstock must have 64K EEPROM (minimum of 46K available for use), with Java VM Version 2.1, and Global Platform Version 2.0.1.  These must be FIPS 140-2, level 2 certified with the current DoD applets and be currently (as of August 30, 2005) integrated into the DoD issuance infrastructure as well as integrated into desktop middleware. Target Date:  December 2005 - DoD expects to purchase FOR END USER PILOT TESTING ONLY approximately 20,000 Dual Interface 64K EEPROM smart cards.  This cardstock must be FIPS 140-2, level 2 certified, have 64K EEPROM (minimum of 64K available for use), with Java VM Version 2.2, and Global Platform Version 2.1.  The pilot is expected to commence in March or April 2006 through July 2006.  These cards will be certified with DoD Transitional applets on the platform.  Target Date:  December 2005 – DoD expects to evaluate card stock with 64K EEPROM (minimum of 64K available for use), FIPS 140-2, level 2 certified JAVACARDS with Java VM 2.1, and Global Platform Version 2.0.1 or higher (Java VM 2.2 and Global Platform 2.1). These must be capable of obtaining FIPS 140-2, level 2 certification with DoD Transitional applets by June 2006.   The DoD Access Card Office will provide all responding card vendors a set of PERFORMANCE APPLETS upon successful verification of cards that meet the requirements.  The applets will be provided at the announced evaluation period.  These applets will be run on the card platform (without DoD applets) and the test results will be provided to DMDC.  These applets will determine metrics such as key generation speed, applet load time, and Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU) communication speed for initialize update, and external authenticate. The purpose of these tests will be to down-select specific card offerings during source selection.  DoD expects at least two different manufacturers cards to be available for use, but does not expect to select more than four cards if they are available and meet the criteria above.  Any card that is selected (partially based on the performance applet test results) will be integrated into the DoD issuance infrastructure and tested with DoD des!  ktop middleware at DoD expense.  Production cards are expected to be purchased 2nd or 3rd quarter CY 2006 for monthly consumption of approximately 200,000 cards.  This platform will be ordered in decreasing amounts to support full dual interface fielding by April 2007. Target Date: December 2006 - DoD expects to evaluate and purchase 64K (or greater) Dual Interface (ISO 14443 with a minimum of 64K usable EEPROM available) smart cards for long-term production of the next generation Common Access Card.  This card will remain as the standard CAC until a new technology refresh is announced (estimated to be 18 - 24 months).   To be eligible for qualification for the dual interface product (target Dec. 2006), vendors must FIPS 140-2, level 2 certify their offering with a DoD Transitional applet, Java VM Version 2.2 and Global Platform Version 2.1.  In order to place the dual interface cards into production, the DoD has adopted the following qualification steps: A. The DoD Access Card Office will provide all responding card vendors a set of PERFORMANCE APPLETS upon successful verification of cards that meet the requirements.  The applets will be provided at the announced evaluation period.  These applets will be run on the card platform (without DoD applets) and the test results will be provided to DMDC.  These applets will determine metrics such as key generation speed, applet load time, APDU communication speed for initialize update, external authenticate. The purpose of these tests will be to down-select card offerings during source selection.  The DoD expects to select at least two, but no more than four cards.   B. Card Vendors must FIPS 140-2, level 2 certify their card platform with the DoD provided applets. The vendor may choose to certify with earlier versions and attempt a delta certification or certify with the final applet version. C. The DoD applet versions will be provided to responsive card manufacturers by contacting ACO.  D. Vendors must pre-qualify their products with an appropriate IV&V laboratory in accordance with the DoD IV&V specifications available by contacting the ACO at:  cacsupport@osd.pentagon.mil The DoD expects to select a minimum of two different cards (one per manufacturer) to insure multiple sources. A maximum of four cards will be chosen to supply the 64K Dual Interface products. All cards will be subject to the Performance Applet testing and selection criteria.  If more than four manufacturers present offerings, the cards will be down selected based upon performance criteria derived from the PERFORMANCE APPLET DATA from the test suite described in qualification step (A). Once selected, the cards will be integrated into the DoD Issuance System at government expense and the follow-on middleware and user testing (90 day minimum) will be undertaken by the government.  When the DoD procures card stock, competition will be partially based on price and availability to meet the delivery schedule.  Of the cards purchased, there will be a minimum of 100,000 cards for each manufacturer/vendor that has been selected, and integrated into the DoD infrastructure.   NO NEW VENDORS WILL BE ADDED OR INTEGRATED INTO THE DoD ISSUANCE SYSTEM UNTIL THE NEXT MAJOR REFRESH CYCLE. The DoD targets that refresh cycle to be at 18 – 24 month intervals. Note that the DoD presents this plan to promote competition and provide fair access to all card vendors.  However, the government reserves the right to adjust this plan based upon programmatic and operational need. Interested parties shall submit their response via email to Deborah.Gallagher@osd.pentagon.mil no later than 31 October 2005.  Responses should be sent in either word or .pdf format and shall not exceed ten (10) pages in length.   Questions regarding this RFI should be addressed to Pam Jay, Email: Pilcherria.Jay@osd.pentagon.mil no later than 14 October 2005.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.

It does not constitute a Request for Proposal RFP or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.   Responses to this notice shall not be construed as offers and cannot be accepted by the Gove rnment to form a binding contract.  The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partys expense.  Not respo nding to this RFI will not preclude participation in any future RFP if issued. Release of reference technical documentation is limited to United States corporations and United States citizens.    2.0 BACKGROUND The Department of Defense established the JTRS program to provide a family of software programmable radios designed around a Software Communications Architecture SCA.  As such, the JTRS will provide reliable multi-channel voice, data, imagery, and video co mmunications and eliminate communications problems caused by stovepipe legacy systems.  The JTRS will achieve these objectives through the procurement and fielding of a digital, programmable, modular communication system based on software-defined radio tec hnology. JTRS will provide interoperability through the capacity to communicate with current tactical communications systems in the near term.  In the future, JTRS will provide integrated information sharing through new waveforms to support joint operations.  This interoperability will help meet the demands of U.S. Military forces and, when needed, communications with other government entities and first responders. As part of this initiative, the JTRS program is evaluating the means by which they can establish an APCO P25 capability within this family of communications products.  This RFI is to solicit industrys views on the state of the APCO P25 initiative, provide  insight into methodologies for developing a JTRS APCO P25 capability that will be interoperable with non-DoD APCO P25 standard devices, and comment on issues that could affect the affordability of the JTRS APCO P25 waveform.  3.0 REQUESTED INFORMATION This RFI requests information from industry regarding the JTRS APCO P25 waveform requirements as well as information regarding possible acquisition strategies.  The questions below provide a starting point for information input. 3.1 Identification of current possible solutions: 3.1.1 Are there any existing technologies that could satisfy the JTRS APCO P25 requirements?  Please quantify and explain any required modifications where possible.   3.1.2 What is the commercial market coverage and anticipated customer base (in terms of quantities) for APCO P25 technology?  3.2 Technology Information: 3.2.1 Interoperability is a primary goal of the JTRS Program What is the industry vision regarding development of radio systems with an interoperable APCO P25 waveform?   Are there any barriers to universally inter-operative APCO P25 radios?   Would a JTRS APCO P25 compliant subscriber se t be able to work with any APCO P25 compliant base station in all APCO P25 Phase 1 modes? Are the current APIs, as defined for the SCA and APCO P25, sufficient to produce and field a fully interoperable APCO P25 capability?  If not, what are the issues? Does industry foresee a requirement for a standard APCO P25 capability/interoperability certification? 3.2.2 Secure communication is major concern within DoD.  The JTRS APCO P25 waveform running on JTRS sets should be capable of protecting the privacy of information when operating in networks made up of commercial equipment.  How would keys and other settin gs be provided from commercial key sets intomilitary JTRS Radios?  What provisions for higher-grade encryption suitable for national defense unclassified and classified use would you recommend?  3.2.3 What are the projected technology trends that will support APCO P25?  3.2.4 Are there any critical issues associated with integrating APCO P25 capabilities onto handheld/small form factor sets? 3.2.5 Commercial Status What is the status of commercial implementation of APCO P25 Phases 1, and 2? What is the expected evolution of APCO P25 Phase 3? 3.2.6 How can current industry life cycle support to APCO P25 products be leveraged to support the JTRS APCO P25? 3.2.7 Which requirement(s) would drive cost/schedule for an APCO P25 waveform application development effort? 3.2.8 Are there changes to the JTRS APCO P25 Waveform Performance Specification that could positively impact the cost/schedule of a development/procurement effort? 3.3 What acquisition strategies may be available that could reduce implementation technical, schedule, and/or cost risk? 4.0 TECHNICAL REFERENCES.

Requirements: The Air Force requires advanced technologies that facilitate the conduct of contingency base operations, combat support functions, and force protection in both homeland security and Air Expeditionary Forces (AEF) operations.     In addition, provide opportunities for reduction of weight, volume, and costs of base emergency response, infrastructure support, and combat support systems.     

AFRL/MLQ solicits cutting edge proposals in the following general technology areas:     

Atmospheric Threat Protection - Identify characteristic emissions or patterns that enable detection, identification, and/or modeling of anthropogenic chemicals in or transported through the atmosphere.     Develop and/or evaluate methods or technologies enabling localization and/or identification of these emission sources, for example storage, use, or accidental/deliberate release of toxic chemicals.     Develop, evaluate, modify, and/or integrate technologies and/or materials that may provide protection from atmospheric threats, either inside or adjacent to forward operating bases, and that may contribute to reducing or eliminating threats to personnel and equipment.     

Protective Technologies - Develop chemical processes and passive or self-decontaminating materials that will reduce recovery time and provide a significant improvement in decontamination capabilities.     Develop sensing, active and passive protection, and decontamination technologies for improved force protection at fixed and forward bare airbases.     Develop systems for detecting and quantifying toxic materials or hazards (chemical, biological, radiological, and energetic).     Provide technology for automated hazard warning/avoidance, neutralization or decontamination, and decontamination validation in operational areas and industrial sites.     Develop technologies to technician operable/maintainable, affordable, deployable and modular, allowing rapid mobilization and demobilization.     Hazard avoidance during operations will allow sustained operations tempo; assurance of effective decontamination of equipment and operational areas; and ability to continue operations in an shirtsleeve environment.     

Explosive Effects Mitigation - Identify explosive characteristic effects or patterns that enable detection, evaluation, and/or modeling of the explosive and resulting effects.     Develop, evaluate, modify, and/or integrate protective technologies and/or materials that may provide protection from blast, ballistic, and fragmentation effects.     Develop new materials, technologies, and/or methodologies to mitigate blast effects resulting in reduced injuries and deaths to building/shelter occupants.     

Shelters - Develop new and advanced shelters that are lightweight and low volume, easy to erect, and requires low maintenance.     The new shelter will be used for housing personnel and aircraft maintenance and storage for long term and under harsh environments.     Specific areas of interest include: airbeam technology based on lightweight and high strength fibers integrated solar power and corporation of chem/bio and directed energy protection into shelter.     

Air Base Operating Surfaces   - Develop lightweight portable airfield evaluation technologies for surface and subsurface material characterization, expedient repair materials and techniques, lightweight high-strength materials, and measurement and prediction in response to traffic and environmental loads.     

Protection of Deployed Forces and Assets - Develop lightweight rapidly deployable personnel and aircraft shelters, and protection systems for facilities and aircraft parking areas.     Specific areas of interest include ultra-lightweight, high-strength materials, exploitation of in situ materials, and post-construction reinforcement of facilities, simulation and modeling of effects of air-blast and fragmentation, and chemical/biological protection systems.     

Combat Utility Systems - Develop new energy and utility systems technologies that increase mobility, reliability, and efficiency on all deployable utilities required for AEF operations.     Specific areas of interest include: fuel reforming to produce hydrogen, active and passive power generation, power conditioning and distribution systems, environmental control units and water production/purification systems.     

Force Protection Robotics - Develop automation and intelligent system technologies for use in high threat areas, expeditionary and fixed airbase support, and homeland security. The general areas of interest include novel unmanned technologies for force protection including civil engineering, explosive ordnance disposal, security forces, and airbase support operations. Specific areas include: UXO detection, characterization, handling, and disposal; advanced ground vehicle navigation and guidance; obstacle detection systems; non-line of sight, high bandwidth communication systems; and innovative robotic vehicle systems including: perception, power, weapons, computing, manipulation, and mobility systems.  

Fire Fighting - Develop agents, systems, equipment and hardware for use in aircraft firefighting and rescue operations, airbase structural firefighting, weapons systems firefighting, hazardous materials incidents, and improved firefighter training.     Develop DoD firefighting systems such as munitions protection and explosion mitigation.     Specific areas of interest include the development of environmentally compatible, operationally and cost effective fire extinguishing agents, aircraft rescue and firefighting vehicles/systems, fire detection/suppression systems, specialized rescue and personnel protective equipment, and training technologies.     The objective is to enhance airbase and other DoD firefighting safety programs and training capabilities that significantly reduce the amount of time to extinguish fires, extract victims, and minimize damage/casualties.     

Biocatalytic Materials Synthesis - High-performance space and aerospace materials are often produced by complex sequences of reactions involving toxic solvents and expensive catalysts.     Some materials are derived from structures that are difficult to make via traditional synthetic chemical techniques.     Successful development of green chemistry approaches to materials synthesis would not only reduce the cost of the material, but also eliminate negative environmental impacts.     One successful approach for synthesis of industrial, pharmaceutical, and agricultural chemicals involves biocatalysis; the use of living cells or enzymes as catalysts for chemical reactions.     Biocatalysis may yield novel materials or better synthetic pathways to known materials by allowing targeted production of specific structures under mild conditions required to support biological processes.

Proposal Preparation: Responses submitted shall include a proposal for technical and cost/price as follows: (a) the technical proposal must include an outline and full discussion of the nature and scope of the research, the method or technical approach, and the expected results of each proposal. This proposal should offer scientific advancement in the state of the art.

ABSTRACT:

The Airbase Technology Division of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Tyndall AFB FL is interested in receiving research proposals in the areas of advanced technologies that develop chemical reactor systems and unit operations.  These reactor systems are intended to (1) produce, or deliver, weapon system specific chemicals in combat quantities, under deployed force conditions, (2) efficiently produce thermal, mechanical or electrical energy on demand using innovative chemistry and reactor systems, and (3) convert or dissipate energy produced from military operations.  In addition, reactor systems and unit operations are desired that (1) utilize compact and light weight designs (2) are compatible with force deployment constraints, and/or (3) utilize new materials or innovative approaches in the use of conventional materials.  Systems developed under this effort must be capable of being integrated with existing deployed base utility systems and concepts while anticipating the requirements of the AF Expeditionary Aerospace Force doctrine for the future.

Proposals should describe scientific study, experimentation, and process engineering to increase knowledge and understanding in these areas.

This Broad Agency Announcement consists of three parts:
PART I - Research Interests
PART II - Proposal Preparation
PART III - Proposal Evaluation
The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.  It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Companies responding to this announcement are cautioned that only a Contracting Officer may obligate the Government to any agreement involving expenditure of Government funds.

This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) constitutes a solicitation for proposals under the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  The BAA describes research requirements and methods for preparing and submitting proposals. 

PART I
RESEARCH INTERESTS

A.  INTRODUCTION
This is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Airbase Technology Division (AFRL/MLQ) under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Proposals submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study, experimentation, and process engineering directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs.  It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs.

AFRL/MLQ contracts with educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for research in Deployed Base Infrastructure, and Force Protection.  This BAA is intended to cover technology associated with the sustainment and logistics support of advanced weapons.  Persons contemplating submission of a proposal to AFRL/MLQ should not only carefully examine this BAA, but are also strongly encouraged to contact the AFRL/MLQ technical person identified in this publication to ascertain the extent of interest which AFRL/MLQ may have in a specific research project.

Prior to submitting a formal proposal, offerors are to submit a white paper on their proposed research topic not to exceed three (3) pages in length.  Submit white papers to the following address: Air Force Research Laboratory Contracting Division, AFRL/MNK, Attn. Ms. Christi O’Leary, 101 West Eglin Boulevard, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6808.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA.  Those offerors submitting white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA will be invited to submit a proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent contract or assistance instruments (grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction).  Proposals submitted may be evaluated as they are received.  Invited proposals may be submitted at any time during the period the BAA is open.

A contract or assistance instrument could be awarded as a result of this BAA, as appropriate.  We expect most awards with universities and non-profit organizations to be grants.  Note that there is no inherent funding associated with this BAA, and any contract/assistance instrument will depend on availability of funds from other sources.  While no parts of this requirement lend themselves to being severed for set-aside to Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs), or Historically Black Colleges and Universities or Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI), the Air Force reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based on responses hereto.  The division goal is to award thirty percent (30%) of the contracts to Small Businesses, ten percent (10%) of the contracts to Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Woman-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), ten percent (10%) of the contracts to Historically Black Colleges and Universities or Minority Institutions, over the life of this BAA.  For the purpose of this BAA, the size standard is 500 employees (NAICS 541710).  In the event sufficient acceptable proposals are not received to fulfill these goals, awards will be made to those proposals received, which are acceptable regardless of source.

B.  MISSION

The mission of the Airbase Technology Division is to conduct research and engineering development that results in the demonstration of high-risk, high-payoff technology needed to meet the current and future requirements.  Long-term technology development is needed to produce lighter, more rapid bare-base deployment; a more secure and protected force structure; and rapid, effective deployment of advanced Air Force weapon systems.  Technological advances in these key areas will ensure sustained global superiority of the Air Force for the foreseeable future through improved Air Force and Joint Operations readiness, rapid exploitation and utilization of the space mission, the successful deployment of advanced, complex weapons, and more effective peace-time training.

PART III
PROPOSAL EVALUATION

A.	Proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be evaluated as received using the factors given below.  The factors are listed in descending order of importance.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the proposals.
1.  The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, the potential contributions of the effort to the AFRL/MLQ mission and the extent to which the research effort will contribute to balancing this Division’s overall research program.
2.  The offeror’s capabilities, related experience (to include past and present performance), facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these, which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.
3.  The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives.
4.  The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror if any, and the availability of funds.
B.	Upon receipt of a proposal, the AFRL/MLQ technical staff will perform an initial review of its scientific merit and potential contribution to the Air Force mission and also determine if funds are expected to be available for the effort. Proposals not considered to have sufficient scientific merit or relevance to Air Force needs, or those in areas for which funds are not expected to be available, may be declined without further review.
C.	It is the policy of AFRL/MLQ to treat all proposals as privileged information prior to award, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  Proposals not declined as a result of initial review will be subject to an extensive evaluation within the Government.  The offeror must indicate on the appropriate form any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the proposal.
D.	Each proposal will be evaluated based on the merit and relevance of the specific research proposed as it relates to the overall AFRL/MLQ program, rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area.

<SUBJECT>Cancellation -- Environmental Engineering Services A-76 Study
<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) provided a formal announcement of the Environmental Engineering A-76 competition on September 30, 2004. The DOE is canceling the Environmental Engineering A-76 competition effective September 30, 2005.  The cancellation is based on a number of factors that are summarized below: When the advanced planning for the A-76 study was first undertaken in FY 2004, the Department anticipated that the nature of its EES type contracts would be such that certain specific functions would be borne by the contractors and thus less direct Federal participation would be needed. However, over the intervening 18 months, several factors have evolved resulting in the cancellation of this competition: -The Office of Environmental Management (EM) is now conducting acquisition planning for several major contracts of a highly complex nature. Successful procurement, execution, and management of these contracts will require more federal integration and oversight. -Many EM projects are at a critical juncture that requires strong Federal Government (owner) planning, evaluation of technical and regulatory issues, project management, and oversight to ensure their successful completion. -Project management and contract management by Federal staff need to be strengthened to address concerns expressed by the Government Accountability Office that these are high management risk areas.  A Secretary of Energy August 2005 memorandum articulates the need for improved project management practices. -The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board in recommendation (2004-1) stressed the need for greater Federal technical oversight of complex nuclear activities like many of EM projects. The combination of all these factors has led to the Department's decision to cancel the EES A-76 study as a necessary step for serving the best interests of the taxpayers and the Government, at this time.

<SUBJECT>18 -- GPS Block IIIA Industry Day #2
<DESC>The Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) Joint Program Office (JPO) will host GPS Block III Industry Days #2 on 12-14 October 2005.  The GPS Joint Program Office will develop and deploy the GPS III System in two separate contractual efforts.  The two efforts will be the operational control segment (OCX) and the space segment (Block III).  The goal of GPS Block III is to provide reliable and secure delivery of enhanced position, velocity and timing signals to military and civil users, while managing long-term total ownership costs.  The GPS Block III effort is focused on design, development, deployment, and operation of future GPS Satellites.  GPS Block III, in tandem with OCX, will achieve long-term GPS performance goals.  It will reduce existing shortcomings and vulnerabilities that impede the ability of GPS to support future military operations and vital civil commerce, transportation, and public safety services.  GPS Block III will fully support the Federal Radionavigation Plan and Federal Radionavigation System, and will address interoperability with all current and planned global radionavigation systems.  GPS Block III will incorporate the space segments of the Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS), the Distress Alerting Satellite System (DASS), and the Space Environmental Detection Payload (SEDP).  GPS Block III will enhance U.S. leadership in space-based navigation to meet the stated Presidential goal of GPS providing the world standard Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) solution.
 
The purpose of Industry Days #2 is to provide the update to the program priorities, acquisition strategy, GPS Block III systems engineering and integration approach, and roadmap to contract award.  In addition to the updates the GPS Block III IPT will provide a classified overview of the Space Segment Specifications.
 
To attend Industry Days #2, please register as instructed below (Registration).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being requested and a written document will not be issued. HSCG38-05-Q-500023 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05. The applicable NAICS number is 325211 and the small business size standard is 500 employees. This is an unrestricted procurement.   The contract  will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5   The U.S. Coast Guard  intends to award a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract for the purchase of EnviroStrip (eStrip) GPX Cornstarch Blast Media, Brand Name or Equal,  including removal and recycle/disposal of spent media to totally eliminate the by-product for a true “cradle to grave” process.  Spent Media Recycle/Disposal must result in the generation of a new product having its own Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) to avoid generating a new waste stream.  The USCG Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (AR&SC) currently uses Archer Daniels Midland eStrip GPX Cornstarch Blast Media to remove paint from aircraft.  The USCG aircraft stripping facility is currently set-up for cornstarch use.  Past practices utilizing other types of blast media produced a large amount of waste material.  Cornstarch Blast Media is currently used because of the “cradle to grave” capability where the spent media is truly eliminated.  Documentation from the State of North Carolina and the state where the product will be recycled/disposed of MUST be on file showing documented approval of the proposed spent media recycle/disposal process.  A site visit may be required by ARSC prior to acceptance of an offer to assure the recycle/disposal process is in compliance with the spent media recycle/disposal requirements.  The term of the contract will be from the date of award not to exceed one year.  Quantities listed are estimates.  All orders under the resulting contract will be placed via funded Delivery Orders. Only the USCG AR&SC will be authorized to issue orders.  Failure of the Government to order any of the line items or quantities described as estimated or maximum will not entitle the contractor to any equitable adjustment in price.   Guaranteed minimum quantity to be ordered by the Government is 8 Boxes.   CLIN 1:  eStrip GPX Blast Media; Estimated Quantity 100 BX.  CLIN 2:  Proof of Paperwork for delivery of spent media to a North Carolina approved and licensed recycling facility.  The manufacturer of the eStrip GPX blast media is Archer Daniels Midland, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Cage Code 35367.    “Equal” products must meet the salient physical, functional or performance characteristics of the cornstarch media.  Offers of “equal products”, including equal products of the brand name manufacturer must clearly identify the item by brand name if any, make, model number, and include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings or brochures.  Offers must clearly describe any modification the offer plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements.  Offers that require modification of the ARSC aircraft stripping facility to make a product conform to the solicitation requirements are not acceptable.   Cornstarch blast media technical specifications/data are not available and cannot be furnished by the U.S. Coast Guard.  Packaging, Packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination.  Material shall be packaged in boxes and shipped on pallets.  Pallets shall have a copy of the packing slip attached indicating Nomenclature, Contract and applicable Delivery Order Number (Delivery Order Numbers are assigned upon issuance), Quantity or Pounds, and a Contract Line Item Number.  All shipments must include a copy of the MSDS.  Each box shall be individually labeled with Nomenclature, Quantity or Pounds, Contract and Delivery Order Numbers and Line Item Number.  Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of each Box.  Packaging shall not consist of popcorn, shredded paper, Styrofoam of any type, or peanut packaging.  Internal packing material shall be sufficient to prevent damage during shipment, handling and storage.  Bar Coding is not required.  Material shall be delivered to USCG Aircraft Repair and Supply Center, Receiving Bldg 63, Attn: Stripping Shop, Elizabeth City NC 27909.  Inspection and Acceptance of material shall be performed by receiving personnel at AR&SC.  The following FAR Subpart 12 provisions and clauses are incorporated by reference:  
FAR 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors-Commercial Items (JAN 2004)  The Closing Date for receipt of offers is 12 October 2005 at 4:00 p.m. EDST.  Offers may be F.o.b. Destination or F.o.b. Origin, Freight PrePaid, however F.o.b. Destination quotes are preferred.  F.o.b. Origin, Freight PrePaid offers must include shipping costs to be considered responsive.   Offers must include a detailed description of the disposal process for the spent blast media and must include documentation from the state of North Carolina and the state where the product will be recycled/disposed showing approval of the spent/media disposal process.  For information regarding this solicitation contact Denise Hall, Contract Specialist at Denise.P.Hall@uscg.mil or faxed to (252) 334-5242.   Questions and requests for information should be submitted in writing.  Facsimile or e-mail offers are acceptable and may be faxed to (252) 334-5242 or e-mailed to Denise.P.Hall@.uscg.mil.    All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered.  Contractors must have valid Cage Codes and DUNS Numbers, and be registered with CCR. 
FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: a) Technical Capability to furnish the required conforming product or an acceptable conforming product and recycle/disposal of spent Blast Media showing a true cradle to grave process; b) Price; c) Delivery; d) Past Performance.  Factors a) through d) are arranged in order of importance.  Technical Capability is of primary importance and includes two parts: 1) ability to provide the required conforming product or acceptable equal product and 2) the recycle/disposal process for spent blast media. Both parts are of equal importance in that they show the offeror’s ability to provide a cradle to grave or closed loop process.  Offerors proposals must clearly describe and demonstrate the generation of a new product through the recycle/disposal process showing that a new waste stream is not created.  This is the primary basis on which offers will be evaluated.  Offerors offering an “equal” product must clearly describe and demonstrate that a modification to the Government’s facility or equipment will not be required for the equal product to be used. 
 FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Mar 2005) Offerors shall include a completed copy of this provision with offer or complete only paragraph (j) of the provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov .  If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) through (i) of this provision.

Numbered Note 12 applies.  
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (GG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

A.	INTRODUCTION

The Senior Military Advisor PSC will play a lead role in development of the new Office of Military Affairs (OMA), developing systems for integrating USAID and DOD planning and operations, and overseeing the placement, structure and successful start-up of senior development advisors to be stationed in combatant commands.  In the absence of the Division Chief, Planning, the PSC will serve as head of the OMA planning function and the creation of planning systems.  His/her function is critical to the successful evaluation and development of sound reconstruction and stabilization programs based on lessons learned from recent major civil-military actions, and the creation of effective coordination mechanisms between USAID and the US military.

B.	BACKGROUND

The USAID Office of Military Affairs (OMA) was created as of March 2005.  It is housed within the USAID Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA Bureau, also home to the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), Food for Peace (FFP), Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) and Democracy and Governance (DG) Offices), but its responsibilities are Agency-wide.  Its objective is to help USAID and the military define, evaluate and develop programs and coordination mechanisms that address areas of common interest between the U.S. defense and development communities, including but not limited to the U.S. National Security Strategy.  

To accomplish this objective, the following tasks will be undertaken:

1.  Evaluate and develop joint and parallel planning and programs focused on regional and field missions supported through USAID regional bureaus and DOD combatant commands (COCOMs).  

2.  Develop mutually acceptable guidance, policy and doctrine as needed for effective program development and coordination.  

3.  Implement training, education and operational programs designed to build understanding and operational efficiency between the two organizations.

Areas of common interest will include humanitarian assistance, the global war on terrorism, strategic communications, conflict prevention and mitigation, counter-insurgency, post-conflict reconstruction and stabilization, and transformational development.  

The office will serve as the Agency-wide unit for managing the day-to-day aspects of the USAID-military relationship.  This responsibility includes program planning and implementation needed for effective operations involving USAID and the military, and the development of operational readiness, leadership and coordinated response capacity for field operations requiring joint USAID-military action.  

The office will consist of two divisions, one for planning and one for operations.  The functions of the planning division  is to serve as the overall coordination unit for managing the day-to-day aspects of the USAID-military relationship, and for planning, program development/management needed for effective future joint and parallel operations involving USAID and the military (U.S. and others).  The operations division will serve as the lead unit to develop operational readiness, leadership and coordinated response capacity for field operations requiring joint USAID-military action.  As noted, the Senior Military Advisor will help oversee both divisions.  

A key aspect of OMA operations will be liaison with key units of DOD.  USAID will have one or two officers who work directly within the Pentagon, one reporting to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict (OSD/SOLIC), which coordinates Special Operations, Humanitarian Assistance and Civil Affairs in DOD, and another reporting to the Joint Staff.  In addition, the locus of informed and enhanced field operations within the US military resides in the combatant commands, both regional and functional.  The key regional commands of specific interest to USAID are as follows:

CENTCOM, or Central Command.  Located at McDill AFB in Tampa, FL, CENTCOM is responsible for field operations throughout the Middle East and the Horn of Africa.  This command covers Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Central Asia, making it the most important and active command at this point in time.

EUCOM, or the European Command.  Located in Stuttgart, Germany, EUCOM is responsible for North, West and Southern Africa, the Caucuses, Europe and Russia.  Africa is now its most strategically important territory.  

PACOM, or the Pacific Command.  Located at Camp Smith in Honolulu, HI, PACOM is responsible for Asia and the Pacific up to the border of Pakistan.  While northern Asia (China, Japan and Korea) are key areas of focus, Southeast and South Asia are increasingly important in the Global War on Terror.  Indonesia and the Philippines are of particular importance.  

SOUTHCOM, or the Southern Command.  Located in Miami, FL, SOUTHCOM is responsible for South and Central America.  Although natural disaster and counter-narcotics responses have been the major focus of civ-mil operations in the recent past, there is a growing list of countries of concern and joint interest on the development front in the region.  

SOCOM, or the Special Operations Command.  Located in McDill AFB in Tampa, FL, SOCOM oversees Special Forces of all services, Information Operations and Civil Affairs.  SOCOM is considered the lead command for the Global War on Terror.  Civil Affairs is a key interlocutor with USAID in most countries on humanitarian and development assistance, and will likely look to a more collaborative relationship with USAID under emerging stability operations programs under DOD.

OMA will be placing a selected number of senior development advisors within the regional and functional commands.  All of the senior development advisors will report to the Senior Military Advisor.   

C. 	MAJOR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

4.  The PSC will create, foster and formalize a network of working relationships between USAID and the US military, with a focus on leaders throughout the Pentagon to include Joint Staff and OSD, leaders of the various regional and functional commands, key service institutions involved in training and deployment, USAID regional bureaus and the Bureau for Policy and Program Coordination (PPC), key USAID contractors and grantees working on programs of mutual interest, Washington decision-makers, other key donors and partners, and lead non-US military groups  such as NATO and other country services.  Represent USAID interests in the development of the relationship with DOD with respect to the Agency’s development agenda, its status as an independent Agency, and its code of conduct.  The relationship should be formalized through proposed details and sharing agreements, establishment of routine procedures, meetings and events that tie the organizations together, and recommended structural changes within the organizations that may be deemed appropriate over time to enhance cooperation.

Brand Name Justification Information: 

1.   The 412 TW/DRP has a requirement for a Brand Name purchase of Apogee Labs equipment required to upgrade the existing telemetry distribution equipment.       
2.   The required telemetry equipment upgrade from Apogee Labs is needed for multiple telemetry outputs.  This telemetry distribution equipment is for the new control room under construction at Ridley Mission Control Center, Edwards Air Force Base, CA. The interface chassis and distribution modules (cards) must support a data rate of 50 mega-hertz to ensure equal distribution in the control room. This effort is to support the 412TH Test Wing mission.  Market research conducted by the Program Office has shown that non Apogee Labs equipment would not be compatible with the existing equipment.     Replacing all the current equipment would be cost prohibitive and negatively impact the mission.  Differences in configuration from the existing equipment could jeopardize the development and use of capabilities at Edwards AFB in support of the 412TH Test Wing mission.
3.   The required equipment upgrade includes:  Basic 3.5 interface chassis,
2-LED’s per channel, switches on every other channel, modular power supply included (9-each).  One TTL BNC in/ (3) TTL BNC out (69-each).  Four TTL BNC TTL BNC out (39-each).   The equipment is all commercial in nature and available to other business entities from Apogee Labs. 
Apogee Labs is the name brand currently utilized in this area of the 412TH Test Wing.   Due to form, fit and function requirements, the required upgrades must be procured by Apogee Labs.

Interested parties who believe they can meet all the requirements for the required Apogee Labs upgrades described in this synopsis are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the required training requirement.     Offerors are required to submit with their quote enough information for the Government to evaluate the minimum requirements detailed in this synopsis.
