Using the NURE (National Uranium Resources Evaluation) surveys of the continental US, the Geophysics group at SIUC will merge the surveys nearly seamlessly, accurately preserving the intermediate and long-wavelength magnetic anomaly fields.   The Government intends to award this requirement non-competitively IAW FAR 13.106-1(b)(2).  Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these services may submit a capabilities statement no later than the closing date of this announcement.

<DESC>The United States Fish and Wildlife Service plans to award a sole source contract to Lotek Wireless, Inc. to upgrade 2 ea SRX_400A W5XG Scanning Receivers to W16AST firmware and to purchase 2 ea Scanning Receivers with W16AST firmware for the Arcata Fish and Wildlife Office (FWO) in Arcata, CA.  This office believes that Lotek Wireless, Inc. is the only manufacturer/source with the required experience and capabilities to deliver and guarantee their products. Arcata FWO uses Lotek Wireless, Inc. transmitters because they have a robust coding scheme and make the smallest coded transmitter available today, which is crucial to our studies of juvenile salmon. Wildlife telemetry receivers are custom-built devices and each manufacturer uses specific hardware and proprietary software to construct their equipment.  Lotek Wireless, Inc. also considers their coding scheme to be proprietary.  Due to the need of the Arcata FWO to use Lotek Wireless, Inc. transmitters, and the proprietary nature of the software in their receivers, they believe only Lotek Wireless, Inc. can perform the modifications and replacement of their receivers. The expected dollar threshold for this requirement is under $25,000. This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue award using other than full and open competition and should not be a request for competitive proposals.  The determination of the Government not to open subject requirement to full and open competition was made IAW FAR 6.302-1 and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1).

Parties must also demonstrate the capability of accessing the ship's MPCMS/CTES from a remote shore site and extracting data from MPCMS/CTES databases for analysis and troubleshooting.  In the absence of responses for firms, which believe they have the capability to perform this requirement, the Coast Guard intends to negotiate with Converteam Inc. for the work described pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(b)(1).  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which will be considered by the agency.  No other notice will be published until award is made.

Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.   Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors(ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii) is significantly less important that Factor (iii) Price.   At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror’s best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   (b) Technical Capability of Proposed item to meet the Requirement, Factor (i) will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial items, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offeror’s technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in the Offeror’s technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award.   ( c ) Offeror’s Past Performance information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, Instructions to offerors-Commerical Items, Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.   Past Performance information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.   Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror’s proposal which has no relevant past  performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the government and thus, may be unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.   The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror’s Past Performance as follows:    NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.   OUTSTANDING:  No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror’s past performance.   SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror’s past performance.   MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror’s past performance.   (e) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.   Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award.   Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/. Offerors shall also complete their Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with required registration in the CCR database. Anticipated award date will be on or before 9/15/06.   Fax quote to 562-626-7877 or Email: Rachel.McFarland@navy.mil.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M. 

The purpose of this requisition is to provide service for optimized laser capture microdissection in cervical tissue, RNA extraction and amplification, and conduct of the Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 human expression array chip.  The University of Wisconsin at Madison presently constructs an in-house HPV array chip that contains 70-mer oligonucleotide probes for all genes of all 37 sequenced mucosotropic HPV genotypes as well as a few selected host genes.  The chip has been verified and optimized with various known samples including HPV-expressing keratinocyte cell lines (NIHS, W12, CaSKI), oral cancer-driven cell lines, and primary cancer tissue, detection of unintegrated HPB DNA and the ability to add additional probes as desired, such as spliced mRNA junctions.  

HPV chip is produced solely by the University of Wisconsin at Madison and the utilization of these assays is critical to the proposed analysis of SUCCEED specimens for host and viral expression, to expand the previous contract MQ-515642 where initial SUCCEED tissue specimens have been evaluated, it is imperative for study validity that the expansion be conducted within the same laboratory using the same assays.

	f.	The review and approval of proofs for each individual requirement may be made through fax transmission, electronic, overnight express delivery, or by special messenger services, as agreed to between the Project Officer and the Contractor.

	g.	The specific job requirement (e.g., delivery schedule, turnaround time, etc.) will be established during the request for quotation process.  Once a requirement is established for this service, and the requirement exceeds the micro-purchase threshold of $2,500, the Ordering Official must compete that requirement by soliciting quotations from a minimum of three (3) BPA vendors who were awarded contracts in support of this printing and printing-related services requirement.  The rotation of contractors for each printing/printing-related requirement will be done sequentially based on the lists established by NAICS Codes and each contractor?s capabilities (including set-aside requirements) to perform under that NAICS Code.  The rotation of contractors, for each requirement, will ensure maximum practicable competition among the multiple BPA contracts.

	h.	The Contractor shall be required to load the original disk files on to its computer and manage any corrections that may occur while in press.  If changes occur in press, the Contractor shall keep the files current.

i.	Upon completion of the project, the Contractor shall  make a new disk containing the corrected Quark file (with pages in sequential order) and return both the original and new Quark disks to the Ordering Official(s) when the full shipment of the printed product is delivered.
  
The size standard for the NAICS codes identified above is 500 employees.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The anticipated period of performance is five (5) years from the date of award.  The planned release date of the solicitation document is on or about September 18, 2006, with a due date of October 6, 2006.  The solicitation will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website.  It is expected that the contract award will occur on or about February 1, 2006.

The Government will evaluate the proposals using the following criteria:  1) Operations and facilities that demonstrate the availability of state-of-the-art equipment and facilities to be used specifically to provide the required printing and printing related services; 2) Staff Capability and Experience, which includes the relationship between the relevant work experience and educational background of proposed staff, and their designated responsibility on the project, and the experience, technical competence, and time commitment of the offeror?s staff; and 3) Project Management and Administration, which includes the overall understanding of the specific services to be provided and the coordination that will be needed with NIH staff to successfully accomplish these services.  This includes the managerial competence, experience, and time commitment of the project manager.

<DESC>The Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) Advanced Development Project (ADP) is initiating a phased acquisition for test articles, design products and manufacturing demonstrations to support the TPS ADP’s effort to develop a preliminary design of a Block 1, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) return-capable heat shield by TPS Preliminary Design Review in December 2007. The goal of the TPS ADP is to reduce or eliminate the consequences and likelihood of TPS performance risks, in part, through the choice of TPS materials and system design features. The TPS ADP is pursuing this risk reduction activity by simultaneously maturing multiple Block 1 and Block 2 (lunar as well as LEO return-capable) TPS materials and heat shield system designs.  Using high density shuttle tile as a design reference, the CEV TPS ADP is seeking a comparatively low risk TPS solution for Block 1 (LEO) that meets all of the following required conditions: 1)  It is an ablative TPS material solution; 2) It can be manufactured at full CEV-scale in a single piece (monolithic);	3) It is currently assessed to be at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 or higher and it has been extensively ground tested at equivalent LEO-return heat fluxes;4)  It is currently assessed to be at an Integration Readiness Level (IRL) of 4 or higher and 5) It has successfully flown on multiple relevant missions. To meet this requirement, NASA/ARC intends to purchase SLA-561V test articles from Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company of Denver, CO in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source.  SLA-561V is a proprietary thermal protection material produced solely by Lockheed Martin Space Systems.   SLA-561V has proven flight capabilities as evidenced by its applications on Stardust, Mars Viking, Mars Pathfinder, and Mars Exploration Rover.  The monolithic design approach of SLA-561V combined with flight experience in a relevant environment and its high overall TRL and IRL values warrants pursuit of SLA-561V as the low risk Block 1 shuttle tile-alternative heat shield solution.  The first phase of the procurement will address the uncertainties and risks associated with material performance of 1.5 to 2.0 inch thick SLA-561V samples at high pressure and moderate heat flux regimes of the LEO re-entry environment.  Arc jet coupons will be purchased for testing at NASA Ames Research Center.  The second phase of the SLA-561V acquisition will seek to increase the maturity of the integrated heat shield design for the monolithic ablator path via the development of a comprehensive Design Data Book (DDB), a material properties database, a detailed thermal response model, failure limit characterization testing, and a full-scale manufacturing demonstration unit (MDU). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications, addressing all areas described in this notice, to perform the entire (two-phased) effort in writing by email to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 noon Pacific Standard Time (PST) on September 15, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Capability statements must address the company’s ability to provide a TPS Block 1 LEO solution (a 5m heat shield) that is ablative and monolithic and is presently at a TRL of 6 or above and an IRL of 4 or above.  TRL and IRL definitions are provided as an attachment to this synopsis.  Comprehensive test data and flight heritage information must be provided to support the required TRL and IRL assessments.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

It will be supported by a wide range of specialized EOC technologies, including: critical incident management software, consequence assessment tool set, loss estimation software (which includes earthquake and flood modeling tools), and IP based geographic information systems.

The objective of the Technical Assistance is to design the technical and operational functions of an emergency operations center and help the State of Rio de Janeiro procure and integrate the core technologies and equipment in order to demonstrate their functionality.  This will include procuring a limited number of communications consoles, desk and computers, display screens, monitors, server, closed circuit television, wireless gas monitors, portable weather station, portable computers, and interface and testing equipment.  The Technical Assistance is intended to demonstrate the viability of the core technologies in a fully integrated EOC facility and thus enable SEDC to expand the EOC and an integrated management system.  The Technical Assistance tasks can be summarized as follows:

?	Architecture and Functional Requirements ? Incident Management System
?	Assessment of Facilities (EOC)
?	EOC Requirements 
?	Telecommunications Infrastructure requirements
?	Facilities Plan
?	Specifications
?	Technology integration
?	Implementation plan (includes economic and financial analysis)
?	Training and Operational Integration (development of event scenario and conduct drill)
?	Development Impact
?	Environmental Analysis
?	Final Report

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to negotiate with only one responsible source, Interindustry Economic Research Fund, Inc., P.O. Box 451, College Park, Maryland 20740, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures at a firm fixed price, for a two year subscription to LIFT 2080 and a LIFT software license.  Inforum-LIFT is uniquely qualified for three reasons: (1) Through previous work under contract to CMS, the LIFT model has been modified to specifically address OACT requirements.  These modifications include those required to develop long term (75+  year) projections.  The capability to analyze detailed industry behavior over the long term is a capability unique to LIFT.  (2) In addition, the LIFT framework permits the user to replace LIFT equations with user specified equations and/or override the models equations or exogenous assumptions.  CMS has already invested considerable time in learning how to use this capability.  Again, this feature (that is, the ability for the user to override the model equations in the context of a long term projection tool) is a feature that is unique to LIFT.  (3) Inforum economists have worked closely with CMS staff for several years on various long term forecasting projects.  As a result, Inforum economists have a detailed knowledge of CMS programs and projects which would be difficult if not impossible to replace. The Government intends to negotiate with only one responsible source pursuant to the authority of Part 6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Therefore, this notice is not a request for a submission.  However, interested parties may submit a description of their capabilities to perform within 5 days of this notice and the submission will be considered

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, 671 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, NJ 08854 to construct the melanoma tissue microarray (TMA) to support marker development to improve diagnosis, prognosis and for the evaluation of response predictive markers.  The Robert Wood Johnson Medical School has an unique sets of melanoma specimens with complete patologic and clinical data available.  They have identified cases with matched melanoma samples representing different stages of melanoma progression from the same patient and they have clinical outcome data on all patients with median follow-up of 5.5 years. These tissue arrays will allow investigators to examine melanoma progression in individual patients and compare primary tumors, regional dermal metastases, nodal metastases, and distant metastases. They have also gathered specimens from patients with thick primary lesions who developed metastatic disease. Primary melanoma arrays are very difficult to produce because of the small sample size.  Therefore, the thick melanoma specimens will provide adequate material for constructing TMAs. Furthermore, each sample included in the array will be identified with respect to B-RAF and N-RAS oncogene mutational status, which would be a unique feature of the TMA. The state-of-art core facilities at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and the expertise of the investigators provide assurance that the project of generating the progression melanoma TMA will be successfully completed.  Their facilities and services include:  1) Tissue Analytical Services (TAS) that have three components: a Tissue Retrieval Service, immunohistochemistry (IHC) Core Facility, and a TMA construction Core Facility. The personnel of the TMA Core Facility will supply the newest equipment to construct array from the supplied tissue and will provide the expertise to produce high quality array;  2) The Division of Biometrics will provide help with optimization of the design of the array; 3) The system that allows automated registration of arrays, high resolution digital imaging of each core, and archiving of the images is available at the institution. The system has also capacity for unsupervised computer-based analysis of immunostained arrays to identify staining signatures of specimens in multidimensional color space; and 4)  the image archive will be linked to the anonymized clinical database to correlate the TMA findings with pathology and clinical outcome measures. The investigators are in the process of developing bar code-based storage and retrieval system that will catalog tissues in a HIPPA-compliant fashion. The investigators at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School are the only known source to the NCI Researcher that has the facilities, samples and expertise required to develop these melanoma tissue microarrays.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  ECISTM  Model 9600 (Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing System) an automated method to monitor cell behavior 	

Purpose/Brief History:

The ACF has a need to acquire cutting edge technology for the study of the behavior of cells involved in the biology of tumors, such as endothelial (microvascular and lymphatic) cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, tumor cells, inflammatory cells, etc.  The ECIS Model 9600 is a high throughput fully automated instrument used to reproducibly quantify growth, migration, morphological changes, cell invasion, cell-ECM interactions among others in living cells. 

This noninvasive system is based on the real time measurement of impedance of small active gold electrodes built in each well where cells are grown. The systems can be also programmed to apply elevated fields for cell migration measurements via an automated wound-healing assay. In addition, high fields can be used at shorter durations to electroporate membrane-impermeable compounds (such plasmids, siRNA, etc) into cells. Minimal training is required when operating the instrument for research purposes in a laboratory environment. Existing technologies in the laboratory such as cell culture, migration assay, wound healing assay etc, are compatible with this technology which enhances our ability to quantify otherwise hard to measure biological events.   

PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

           Applied Biophysics Inc. is the only company which makes a electric cell-substrate impedance sensing system that meets the following specifications which are required fore the ACF?s research:
	
1)	The ECIS 9600 6x16 is capable of automatically monitoring up to 96 tissue culture wells and of returning quantitative information regarding the impedance of small 250-micrometer electrodes used as substrates for cell growth.  The system can be run at 3 different preset AC frequencies and monitors the voltage across the active electrodes with a full set of data sampling completed in 21 seconds.  Custom software included with the system runs on a Windows platform and both controls data acquisition and analysis including plotting of the data time series.
2)	The software includes the functionality of reading a single 96 well plate (9600) as well as a second set of software for multiple lab use (6x16 software) for monitoring six sets of 16 wells independently at the same time.  The instrument comes complete with the basic instrumentation, a dedicated personal computer, 7 array holders for the incubator space, and a supply of ECIS consumable arrays (unless otherwise renegotiated).  
3)	The ECIS 9600 6x16 instrument can be used to monitor any animal cell that anchors to its substratum.  Most cell types can be employed in ECIS-based assays for cell proliferation, cell attachment and spreading to ECM proteins, extravasion, signal transduction, and cell migration.
4)	Other instruments that measure TER (transepithelial resistance) are designed for extremely tight epithelial layers and only make single point measurements; whereas, ECIS is not restricted to tight layers and can monitor any adherent cell type in monolayer or sparse culture with continuous, real-time measurements.  
5)	The ECIS 9600 6x16 system also has an optional high field module that allows one to carry out automatic wound healing assays.  There is no other source of this technology on the market today that can accomplish a fully automated wound healing / migration assay in real time without opening the incubator door.

<DESC>General Background Information:


Raytheon Technical Services, Polar Services Company, (RPSC) will be soliciting proposals towards securing a charter (with an option to buy?)  an Antarctic Research and Supply Vessel (ARSV) with icebreaking capability to operate in and around the waters of the Antarctic Peninsula and Southern Oceans in support of the United States Antarctic Program.

RPSC presently charters and provides science support staffing on the R/V LAURENCE M. GOULD and the R/V NATHANIEL B. PALMER for the National Science Foundation, an agency of the United States Government, and it is on their behalf that RPSC is pursuing the charter of a vessel to meet the scientific research and Palmer Station logistics support requirements of the United States Antarctic Program to be chartered for a period of five (5) years with options for another five (5) years.  The purpose of this announcement is to seek interested parties in industry capable of supplying a vessel to continue to provide services currently supported by the R/V LAURENCE M. GOULD.

The vessel will be required to operate frequently in ice, with frequent operations south of 60 degrees South Latitude and in the often extremely stormy waters south of Cape Horn in the Drake Passage, to provide logistic and oceanographic research support for Palmer Station.  It must be sea worthy and fully found, appropriately classed and providing a stable platform from which to conduct such research as may be programmed at that time and comfortable enough to support personnel at sea for extended periods.  Such remote operations necessarily require a reliable and well fitted vessel. Operations in support of scientific research and the requirement to re-supply and carry personnel to Palmer Station will be of equal importance within the Technical Requirements in the RFP.

It is anticipated that an RFP will be issued in December of 2006 or January of 2007.  To receive the full Request for Proposal, industry is requested to provide Letters of Interest by September 15, 2006 to:

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Security Cooperation and Information Management Support to G3-IOD. As directed by the National Military Strategy, the United States European Command (USEUCOM), and the Army International Activities Plan, the International Operations Division (IOD), G3, Headquarters, United States Army, Europe (USAREUR) (hereafter referred to IOD), fulfills the G3 staff function of oversight for and coordination of USAREURs role in promoting regional stability under the Theater Security Cooperation Strategy.  In or der to do so, IOD manages programs, exercises and other activities to engage Allies, partners and others in USAREURs area of operations. Within its component branches, the IOD has responsibility for all U.S. Army arms control matters in Europe; planning a nd conducting political-military policy analysis that informs the staff of operational implications and appropriate responses; coordinating the Commanding Generals and others visits throughout the Area Of Responsibility (AOR); conducting high level confe rences and supporting workshops; managing the tasking and timely execution of requirements relating to all political-military activities; and supporting the other elements of the USAREUR staff on all matters relating to international operations, host natio n and political-military affairs.  All of these areas require timely access to information, standardized and automated processes, and the ability to share information rapidly with higher, subordinate and parallel levels of command.  Execution of these task s requires a high degree of skill and knowledge for the accomplishment of tasks of a technical military and scientific nature, as detailed in the tasks below.  This provides an ideal basis for the execution of the critical information tasks required to ens ure timely and efficient execution of the priorities on USAREURs Mission Essential Tasks List (METL), to include promoting regional stability. The contractor, management and labor to provide enhanced planning and automation support; planning and supportin g conferences and seminars; and automation of military-to-military (mil-to-mil) activities. The contactor will provide database management and data input support, to include maintaining the website and existing database software, as well as inputting data required by EUCOM and DA theater security cooperation automation systems.The contractor shall provide user training and assistance to IOD staff on the operation of existing and contractor developed management tools and databases, including the two websites , Theater Security Cooperation database input, Mil-to-Mil and Pol-Mil databases. Contractor assistance shall be made available on-site in the IOD division. The contractor shall track, collate and enter, on a back-up basis, relevant security cooperation act ivity information into designated databases.  Additionally, contractor shall perform routine maintenance, troubleshooting and upgrades on its management tools and database to ensure compatibility of its systems with IOD hardware and software for the durati on of the contract.Contractor will provide planning support for USAREURs programs supporting various theater security cooperation contact programs in accordance with the Vienna Document (99). IOD has recurring demands for political-military, economic and  defense program analysis to evaluate the allocation of USAREUR resources to these regional stability operations. The contractor must be able to analyze USAREURs external environment (e.g. political climate, economic and social trends, legislation, custom er demand/expectations, changes and advancements in technology, emerging technology trends, and competitive conditions) to determine its effects and relationship on advancing the goals and direction of USAREUR operations. The contractor must be able to res pond with timely and frequently updated specialized technical military evaluations that can be formatted either into operations plans/orders or electronically t ransmitted to USAREURs forward support teams and forward deployed Operational Command Posts (OCP). This data will support headquarters functions of managing information and data related to planning and programming future regional stability country outreac h programs.On a task order basis, the Contractor will research and analyze information resources on a country-by-country, regional or subject basis for individual study projects covering the 91 nations within the USAREUR Area of Interest (AOI).  The Govern ment will provide the specific requirement to the contractor, who will respond with a firm fixed price proposal for that specific requirement.  If accepted by the Government, the task order will be finalized as a firm fixed price order.  In order to delive r appropriate products, the contractor must have an understanding of USAREURs regional stability and theater security cooperation (TSC) operations and be able to customize information provided to support ongoing and planned regional stability and TSC oper ations. Because the military, political climate, legislation, economic and social trends can change with great frequency in many nations in the USAREURs AOI, USAREUR may require specific political-military and individual country expertise to provide perti nent information on an as-needed, as-ordered basis. Due to the volatility of the information contained in country resource projects or specific mission requirements, and often unforeseen changes in USAREUR operational priorities, USAREUR Contracting Office r Representative (COR) will issue such requests as separate, individual task orders.  When such products are requested, the Contractor will provide draft copies of each product to IOD for review prior to delivery of final version.The CG USAREURs Annual St rategic Research Program includes the preparation and conduct of workshops, conferences, CG Senior Officer Training, and Officer Professional Development meetings focused on collecting and analyzing data related to the technical military environment in Eur ope and impact of regional stability operations in the countries within the USAREUR AOI. The CG-hosted annual Conference of European Armies (CEA) focusing on a topic of special interest to the command is central to this research program. Data and analysis resulting from the Strategic Research Program provides USAREUR senior leadership and staff with a better understanding of their complex technical military operating environment, and is integral to USAREURs regional stability and TSC operations. The contra ctor shall prepare and help conduct the annual USAREUR-sponsored Conference of European Armies (CEA) on a topic of special interest to the command. The contractor will conduct analysis of USAREURs strategic environment and provide topic recommendations to  IOD annually. On a task order basis, the contractor may be tasked to conduct one research workshop annually related to the CEA. The research workshop will be designed by the contractor to prepare for, follow-up, or complement the CEA research conference. The research workshop shall be planned for 50 persons for a period of up to 4 days at a location within the USAREUR area of influence. Timing, location, and content of the workshops require prior IOD approval.  Since costs for the location and logistics su pport for this subtask are variable (as they are for CEA above), the costs for the logistical support will be reimbursed separately from the firm fixed price for the task order.The contractor shall provide monthly cost and technical status reports of work in progress. Review of status of tasks including problems and corrective action taken/recommended will be addressed. The costs portion of the report will provide a list of cost incurred for items reimbursable by the government under this contract, as well as a projection of such costs for the remainder of the contract year. These reports will be provided by the 15th day of each month to the Contracting Officer Re presentative (COR) and will cover the activities of the previous month and anticipated work of the next month.  In addition, the contractor shall provide a separate budget status report directly to the COR when 75% of the budget is spent; this report shall  be submitted within two weeks of spending 75%. The contractor project manager shall meet with the COR and IOD personnel on a semi-annual basis, either telephonically or at a place determined by the COR, to review contractor performance, costs and budget s tatus during the preceding six-months and identify any adjustments or modification in the statement of work and budget necessary to accomplish activities planned for the coming six month period.  In addition, the project manager shall be responsive to the COR 24 hours a day, every day of the contract.  For urgent requests, the project manager shall respond to COR verbal or telephonic messages within 8 hours of the COR calling the contractors designated 24 hour response line.  For routine matters, the proje ct manager shall respond to the COR within one duty day. On site services shall be performed Headquarters, U.S. Army Europe, 168 Roemerstrasse (Campbell Barracks), D-69126 Heidelberg, Germany.  For contractor personnel assigned to G3-IOD, the Government IL S is provided to those contract employees who are granted Technical Expert Status Accreditation from the appropriate German State Government (see Army in Europe Regulation 600-700, paragraph  7-1).  Historically, only one of the two positions, that of an a utomation and information technology specialist has been granted Technical Expert Status.

<DESC>Announcement/SIR No. 1, DTFAAC-06-R-00394, posted June 26, 2006, is hereby superseded by the following Announcement/SIR No. 1. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement for engineering, computer, and administrative support services in support of power, navigational aids, communications, surveillance, and weather systems.  The requirement is predominantly for hardware and software engineering services involved in the acquisition, restoration, maintenance, and modification of ground-based NAS equipment throughout the United States and some overseas sites.  Contractor management and personnel will be based at the MMAC in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  Requirements are defined further in a Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The current version of the PWS is provided as a separate document under this Announcement/Screening Information Request No. 1 (SIR1).  Interested parties are also encouraged to visit the MMAC Home Page.  Offers will be evaluated and contract award made on the basis of "Best Value to the FAA."  A Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) type contract is anticipated for this acquisition.  The contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base year with four (4) 1-year options to be exercised at the sole discretion of the FAA. This requirement is offered to qualified, responsive, small business concerns through use of a "2-Tier" CASCADING ORDER OF PREFERENCE to determine the extent of eligible potential offerors.  Offers will be considered beginning with evaluation of Tier 1 and following with evaluation of Tier 2, as necessary.  Tier 1 is relegated to screening of potential offerors from among nation-wide Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business (SEDB)/8(a) concerns and Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses.  Tier 2, if necessary, will consider nation-wide small business concerns.   The "2-Tier" process not only involves a determination of eligibility of the potential offerors at each tier, but also the number of eligible offerors from which the FAA can determine sufficient potential exists for adequate competition.  The existence of potential for adequate competition is defined as identification of at least six (6) competitive offerors from qualified, responsible business concerns at the tier under consideration from which it is anticipated that fair market prices can be obtained. If at least six (6) potential competitive offerors cannot be identified at Tier 1, then Tier 2 offerors will be considered.   If a determination as to the potential for adequate competition cannot be made from Tiers 1 and 2, the FAA reserves the right to award a contract based on full and open competition.  Potential offeror(s) identified as qualified from screenings associated with Tiers 1 and 2 will be included when considering full and open competition.  The requirement will be re-announced on the FAA's website.   For purposes of this requirement, a Small Business is defined as follows: 1) Classified as a small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541330, Engineering Services (Aerospace Equipment) - $25/million.   2) An eligible SEDB/8(a) small business concern expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the 8(a) program and which meets such criteria at the time of submission of the offer.   3) A "Service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern"â€”  (1) Means a small business concernâ€”  (i) Not less than 51 percent of which is owned by one or more service-disabled veterans or, in the case of any publicly owned business, not less than 51 percent of the stock of which is owned by one or more service-disabled veterans; and  (ii) The management and daily business operations of which are controlled by one or more service-disabled veterans or, in the case of a service-disabled veteran with permanent and severe disability, the spouse or permanent caregiver of such veteran.  (2) Service-disabled veteran means a veteran, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(2), with a disability that is service-connected, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(16).  Should a SEDB/8(a) vendor propose a teaming arrangement, the term "vendor" applies to the prime contractor.   For those vendors contemplating entering into a joint venture please reference SBA website at http://www.sba.gov/ca/santa/sa_joint-venture_html.html.  While the FAA will be the approving authority in lieu of the SBA for any proposed joint ventures for this undertaking, the SBA standards for approving joint ventures will be employed.  All documentation to enter into a joint venture must be submitted with response to this SIR No. 1. Each firm claiming SEDB/8(a) status is required to provide a copy of its SBA 8(a) certification letter to the Contracting Officer with its response to this SIR1.  Each firm claiming status as a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business may provide a letter self-certifing their status.  Offerors are to submit a FAA Business Declaration form with their response to this announcement.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility. In conjunction with the set-aside nature of the requirement, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor.  This requirement is found in AMS Clause 3.6.1-7, Limitation on Subcontracting.   This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  This, the initial phase, involves the announcement/SIR1 of the requirement.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this SIR1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the downselect process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this SIR1.   Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of responsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendor's eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendor's eligibility pursuant to this SIR1.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendor's information.  Any statement included in a vendor's response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  Documentation includes, but is not limited to, formal resumes, licenses, financial statements, work plans, etc.  All documentation is limited to 25 pages (8-1/2"x11", printed on one side).  The 25-page limit only applies to the technical proposal (financial statements are exempt from the page limit of 25).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendor's response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility.   SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendor's submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendor's eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR.   (Note: Each submission will be evaluated on an "acceptable/unacceptable" basis.  Where a submission is found to be unacceptable in any area of a special standard of responsibility, the entire submission will be considered unacceptable). 	1.  Experience:   		(a) Document vendor's or predecessors experience with engineering and computer support services as identified in the attached PWS, Section 2, Areas of Effort, for ground-based National Airspace System (NAS) equipment or similar systems and equipment.  Note: A predecessor corporation is a corporation, which has existed in the past, has been replaced by a corporation which exists today, and for which a legal chain of successorship can be documented.  Mergers and acquisition activity accounts for such a predecessor-successor chain among corporations.  In evaluating experience of vendors whose experience was attributed to a pre-existing or through a previous company, any such experience will be considered.  The vendor's documented experience shall consist of a list of contracts containing the following information: (i)	Contract number and contract type (ii)	Contracting agency or business (e.g., DOD, FAA, NASA, any Federal agency, State of Oklahoma, etc.) (iii)	Original contract dollar value and final contract dollar value (including options) (iv)	A brief description of the contract effort (v)	Largest number of employees associated with direct contract effort (vi)	Name, address, telephone and FAX numbers for the  	Government Contracting Officer(s); for non-government  	contracts, provide the name, address, telephone and FAX  	numbers of business point of contact, liaison, etc. 		(b) Where inquiries made pursuant to (a)(vi) reveal the vendor's performance was unsatisfactory (e.g., terminated for default {partial or complete}, cure notice(s) issued, adverse administrative findings by government agencies at the federal, state or local level, etc.), the vendor will no longer be eligible to continue in the SIR process. 2.  Organizational Management and Staffing: Vendors must demonstrate an ability to provide management and staffing commensurate with the demands of this requirement in the following areas: 		(a) Vendors must demonstrate that Contract Manager will be available at the time of contract award that meets the qualifications identified in the PWS.  Documentation as to individual qualification may include a brief synopsis or resume of work experience.  Resume should include present position or title, experience in managing contracts for similar services of scope and size (include duration or length of all experience), educational background, and training in sufficient detail to facilitate evaluation of qualifications and technical or management competence. 		(b) Vendors or predecessors must document/demonstrate that they have simultaneously employed and successfully administered, tracked, and managed 150 or more full-time employees for a period not less than one (1) year.  Documentation may include, but is not limited to: 1) a spreadsheet identified month by month for the annual period containing a list of employees and their managers, and the contracts on which they performed, 2) signed certification with a list of employees with date of employment including employees' managers and the manager's qualifications.

Accounting System and Financial Capability: 		Provide documentation that your company: 			(a) Currently has an "acceptable" job cost accounting system for cost-reimbursable type contracts according to the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) standards.  Identify your company's accounting system software package.  Provide the date of and the name of the DCAA field office performing the latest accounting systems audit.

Description
The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is surveying the market to determine potential sources qualified to perform JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).  We anticipate a 5 to 10 year contract with support beginning on 01 July 2007.

Anticipated Acquisition Schedule: 
Draft RFP Release                   September 06
Presolicitation Conference          September 06
RFP Release                         October 06
Contract Award                      May 07

BACKGROUND

GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon Aircraft Corporation (RAC) as the prime contractor.  RAC is currently providing GBTS CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.  The GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the maximum student and instructor training load at each training site. The GBTS has three major functional areas:     Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and the Training Integration Management System (TIMS).

There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training operations.     Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students normal and emergency procedures as defined in the Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) syllabus.  All three utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).  This includes a full functioning replica of the T-6 front seat cockpit and the same Instructor Operating Station (IOS).     Each simulator has no motion.  Each has five PC computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing system and the electronic control loading.  The primary difference in the devices is the level of corresponding visual system.  The Unit Training Device (UTD) has no visual system.  The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33 degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.  Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 or 10 Visual Control Computer and Image Generator.  Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.  The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five.

The other two ATDs are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer (EST).  The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning instruments and a moving stick and throttle.  It also has a canopy that replicates the opening forces of the A/C.  The EST is a standalone mock-up of the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection procedures.  A student is given an aural indication when ejection has been properly initiated.

The Courseware consists of Developed and Standardized courses and their associated syllabi.  The T-6 Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) student, T-6 Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and admin courseware (which teaches users how to use the GBTS) are developed courseware.  The courseware was developed using Authorware.  Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate training platforms.

TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying training programs (T-6, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)  TIMS operates on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.  Portions of TIMS, developed with Microsoft .NET, require an application server.  The core TIMS development environment includes Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (Visual Basic, C++, C# and Java).     

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT

RAC is currently responsible for integration of all GBTS components.

On-Site ATD support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, and NAS Pensacola.  At the Air Force locations, the contractor provides required manning, spare parts, and support equipment to meet mission effectiveness of 95%.  There are financial penalties for not meeting the mission effectiveness.  The Government does not own ATD spares at Air Force Locations.  At the Navy location, the contractor provides manning, support equipment and replenishes Government owned spare parts.     Maintenance actions and spare parts usage are tracked using Magic Service Desk.

On-Site TIMS Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, Columbus AFB, Vance AFB and Sheppard AFB.  Each of these locations has CLS for the CAI labs and a Helpdesk (takes and responds to calls and walk-ins, enters trouble tickets, performs system administration and database administration, etc.).

Randolph AFB has one CAI lab in bldg. 740
Moody AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 709
Laughlin AFB has two CAI labs (one right above the other) in bldg. 328
Columbus AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 230 and 268
Vance AFB has two labs in CAI bldg. 672
Sheppard AFB has one CAI labs in bldg. 2320

Randolph AFB is the central site for the Modification and Update Support System (MUSS) which makes changes and distributes these changes to other GBTS locations.     The MUSS supports:
ATD software and visual database maintenance
Developed courseware (i.e. CAI Graphics, Test Bank Questions, Syllabus Management)
Standardized courseware integration, quality checks, syllabus management and distribution
TIMS software maintenance (additional support provided at contractor location)
Systems and Sustaining engineering (support provided at contractor location)


FOLLOW-ON CLS CHALLENGES AND EXPECTATIONS

The required support will not include on-site ATD maintenance support for the Navy.     Excluding the Navy sites, the total support provided will be no less than the support described in the current environment above.  Support will be required to integrate T-6 and ATD production changes into the fielded GBTS.  TIMS MUSS support will require Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 certification as a minimum.     The contract type is anticipated to be fixed price with some T&M effort.

Interested sources should submit information that describes in-house capability and what might be subcontracted.  Provide experience and knowledge of:
1.     Simulator support
2.     Courseware support
3.     Training management systems and IT systems administration
4.     Software certification level
5.     Undergraduate/graduate flying training

If you have already responded to a prior sources sought announcement for this effort, updates may be submitted to address any changes contained herein.  Any comments to the documents for this effort may be addressed to the contracts representative, Ms. Lisa Adams, Lisa.Adams@wpafb.af.mil, or Ms. Michelle Hendricks, Michelle.Hendricks@wpafb.af.mil.

Information contained in this synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on line (NECO) site at www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case that FBO is not available.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Division Crane. Amendment 2 The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division requires Clip-on Night Vision Devices-Sensor Fusion (CNVD-SF).  A five year indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity contract is anticipated. Expected quantity is a minimum of 15 units and a maximum of 10,648 units.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination NSWC-Crane.  Fifteen (15) units required 150 days from award date of contract with subsequent deliveries at a rate of 200 units every 30 days until order is complete.  Preliminary inspection will occur at source by a Government QAR and final inspection and acceptance will be at destination by NSWC Crane personnel. This solicitation will be issued on a full and open competition basis using a performance specification.

<RESPDATE>092506
<ARCHDATE>10102006
<CONTACT>Scott Tharp, Contracting Officer, Phone (513) 487-2092, Fax (513) 487-2107, Email tharp.scott@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Water Supply and Water Resources Division, 2890 Woodbridge Avenue, Edison, New Jersey, requires paving for the Urban Watershed Research Facility (UWRF).  Several different types of pavement are required.  Pavement type will be a mix of porous pavement (block and poured), hot mix asphalt (HMA) and paver stones.  The Contractor shall provide all supervision, labor, materials, tools, equipment, hardware, and documentation necessary to complete the project.  The project consists of two objectives:  (A) Connect parking lot and laboratories to the road leading up to the UWRF.   (B) Allow the evaluation of porous pavement as a method of stormwater treatment and volume control. The Contractor shall:  (1) Grade and trench the site as necessary so that the required pavements can be installed.  Approximately 3700 sq ft will need to be graded.  There are remnants of existing pavement under much of the area.  Grading and trenching shall adhere to current grade.  A 65 ft long, 2 ft wide trench shall be required for stormwater treatment and volume control monitoring purposes.  This trench shall carry piping and will be back-filled with pea gravel and capped with concrete block as described in the next section on porous pavement.   (2) Pave approximately 1560 sq ft with Porous Pavement.  Four separate segments shall be constructed with separate drainage for stormwater treatment and volume control monitoring purposes.  Two concrete treatments shall be used, blocks and poured pavement, each with two sections.  Each section shall measure 30 by 12 ft and be lined with an impermeable liner and a 2 in. diameter drainage pipe (HDPE 80) heat sealed to the liner.  The liner shall be puncture resistant, minimum of 6 mil thickness, and ideally should completely cover each section and sides to surface (15 ft by 35 ft).  The pipes shall be placed on top of liner and heat sealed at each end (four heat seals in all).  Drainage pipes shall be provided by EPA.   (3) A 10 ft wide and 140 ft. long vehicle access run of a Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) strip is required from the end of the existing road to the greenhouse.  This should be as straight as possible given the layout of the facility and the requirements for the porous pavement above.  This asphalt strip should abut the new porous pavement. In addition, asphalt shall be used to connect the concrete pavement in front of the high bay to the new strip of asphalt.  An additional 10 by 60 ft and 10 by 12 ft section is anticipated.  Total estimated area of coverage is 2120 sq ft.   (4) The contractor shall provide five walkways connecting buildings to the new asphalt strip.  The location will be from the greenhouse, laboratory trailers, walk-in freezer, and high bay.  The width of walkway runs should match with access ways and doors.  The most economical method for walkway construction may be used.  However, a portion (10% to 33%) of these walkways for this task is required to be rubber sidewalks made from recycled tires.  These strips of recycled tires are anticipated to sit on a base material 2 to 4 inches thick with an impermeable liner beneath and are estimated to be 3 times as costly as concrete walkways.  Piping for drainage and monitoring will be provided.  The upper estimate of total walkway coverage is 250 sq ft.   Upon completion of each task identified above the EPA Project Officer will inspect the work for acceptance. Acceptance of the overall project will be by Contractor demonstration the installed Porous Pavement System performs as required by the objectives of this project.   A firm-fixed price contract is anticipated.  Contract award will be made using best value methodology.  Three (3) evaluation factors will be used: Technical Expertise, Past Performance and Price.  Technical Expertise and Past Performance are significantly more important than Price.  The anticipated contract performance period is 60 calendar days after receipt of notice to proceed.  The estimated price of the work is between $25,000 and $100,000.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.  All prospective offerors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration system in order to be eligible for contract award.  See the website www.ccr.gov for information about registration. The solicitation with specifications, drawings, and site visit information, will be released through the internet on the Fedbizopps website.  The anticipated solicitation release date is approximately 15 calendar days after the electronic posting date of this notice.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be provided.  Interested parties may contact Scott Tharp, in writing, via fax (513) 487-2107 or email at Tharp.Scott@epa.gov with questions.

<DESC>The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) is seeking a contractor to perform investment and recordkeeping tasks in support of the Court Registry Investment System (CRIS).  The Court Registry Investment System (CRIS) is a cash management system for court registry funds developed and tested by the Clerk, hereinafter called CRIS Fund Manager, of the United States District Court of the Southern District of Texas (TX-S), which is located in Houston.  The system began operations in 1988.  Currently there are twenty-three participating courts around the country.  As of June 30, 2005, the registry fund total for all federal courts was approximately $3.3 billion of which $1.8 billion was invested in CRIS.  

Securities purchased are normally held until maturity.  Safety of principal and liquidity of investments without sacrificing principal are among the more important objectives of the CRIS.  The Clerk of the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Texas, known as the CRIS Fund Manager, seeks a contractor to assist in developing portfolio strategies to accomplish the objectives of CRIS, to advise on the selection of specific investments, to execute directed securities transactions, and to maintain case-by-case accounting records.

In brief, each week the CRIS Fund Manager is advised of new deposits and planned withdrawals.  The contractor will advise what security transactions, consistent with the CRIS objectives, are appropriate in these instances.  The CRIS Fund Manager will then direct the contractor to buy or sell specific securities.  Securities purchased by the contractor will be transferred to the CRIS account in the Securities Handling Resource-sharing Endeavour (SHARE) system maintained by the Federal Reserve.  Once confirmation of the transfer has been received from the Federal Reserve Bank an immediate payment (deposit) will be recorded in the contractors reserve account at the Federal Reserve Bank.  In those rare instances when securities must be sold prior to maturity, funds must be deposited in Treasurys General Account at the Federal Reserve Bank prior to the securities being transferred from the CRIS account in SHARE.  Because monies remain on deposit with the Treasury and are never in possession of the contractor, there are no collateral requirements.  The contractor will next update individual case records by adding new deposits, subtracting withdrawals and allocating portfolio earnings.  A case investment report will then be mailed to each court member.  Other portfolio information and statistics will be provided to the CRIS Fund Manager on a regular basis.  The point of contact for this solicitation is Michelle Hupp, Contracting Officer, (202) 502-1574.

<DESC>Requirement:

The United States Government currently occupies 34,923 rentable square feet of office and related space in a building under lease in Silver Spring, Maryland, that expires June 20, 2013.  The Government has a requirement for an additional approximately 12,754 rentable square feet of contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The total rentable space must yield a minimum of 42,937 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The delineated area is Silver Spring, Maryland.   

Proximity to metrorail is required.   

The Government is considering whether to expand at the existing location or to relocate to alternative space which can meet the entire space requirement.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government?s entire requirement as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, rent payments on vacant space under the existing lease or cost of buyout, etc.

Contractor to conduct a Reconnaissance Level Survey using the latest revised Standard Operating Procedures in accordance with the Oregon State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO).  The survey is to be conducted at the Southern Oregon Rehabilitation Center & Clinics (SORCC), 8495 Crater Lake Highway, White City, Oregon.  The survey shall be in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA) Section 106 and The Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), Historic Sites Act of 1935 to document historic structures and make available to the public an archive of records of American’s Architectural Heritage to facilitate implementing the Department of Veterans Affairs Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES) plan.   The SORCC includes fifty seven buildings mostly with interconnecting corridors on approximately one hundred forty-five (145 acres).  A complete Standard Survey is to be completed considering the SORCC as a single historic district.   General requirements of a Oregon State Reconnaissance Level Survey are: (1) Select Survey Boundaries; (2) Prepare a Research Design; (3) Conduct the survey: mapping, photographic documentation, recording sites on the SHPO form; (4) Enter data into SHPO database (see #6); (5) Prepare final report consisting of: statement of survey objectives; boundaries; brief outline history; survey results; recommendations for National Register eligibility and future site activities in consultation with SHPO; explanation of fieldwork techniques; bibliography; and (6) Submit Survey Materials for inclusion in SHPO inventory database.

These qualifications, in general, are a graduate degree in architectural history or a closely related field, or a bachelor’s degree in the same fields plus at least two years of full-time experience in architectural history-related work.  Perhaps more important than academic training is fieldwork experience in identifying and evaluating historic buildings.  Non-professionals may assist with certain parts of the survey, but a professional must direct all aspects of the work.   Evaluation factors to be considered will be (1) Specialized experience of the firm with similar contracts; (2) Past record of performance on similar contracts; (3) Geographical location and facilities of the working office; (4) Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to this project.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR TELEVISION SERVICE
37 TRAINING Wing, Lackland AFB, TX
Description
Department of the Air Force, Air Education and Training Command (AETC), 37 Communications Squadron (37 CS), Lackland Air Force Base, Texas is seeking sources capable of providing commercial television services to the 37 Training Wing (37 TRW), and Tenant Units . This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only. This information will be used in conducting market research to identify potential sources and commercial products and obtain prices. It should be noted that the need for cost/price data, if even only rough order of magnitude data, is to assist in the planning process. This RFI does not constitute an invitation for bid (IFB), request for proposal (RFP), or request for quotation (RFQ), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the United States Air Force. 

Overview: Television services for Lackland AFB are currently provided on a non-exclusive Franchise Agreement (FA) basis, to 100+ geographically separated facilities. The Government seeks to reduce overall cost of television services. The Vendor shall provide a "basic package" of channels at a minimal, reasonable cost defined as what is available on the local market for off-Installation subscribers.   Requirement will be for the vendor to propose possible costs of installing commercial television services to over 2800 rooms in 40-50 facilities/buildings at Lackland Air Force Base.  TV service to billeting is to include one premium channel in addition to the basic package. The Vendor shall also make available one channel for broadcast of government commander's channel if possible.  The Vendor shall ensure that the system is designed, installed, and operated in a manner that meets or exceeds the technical standards required or recommended by the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) as set forth in 47 CFR Part 76. The Vendor recognizes that signal leakage or other interference, including emission, radiation, or induction, from the television system that affects the Government's air navigational, communications, or surveillance facilities, or other electronic device or equipment located on the Installation may disrupt or endanger military activities and may pose a threat to the safety of both the public and military personnel. The Vendor shall address all necessary actions, including testing, maintenance, and coordination with government personnel to prevent any such leakage or interference. 

System Requirements:  The Vendor may deliver television services via any FCC approved method: Cable TV, Satellite TV, TV over Internet, etc.  The Government seeks to consolidate television services to reduce the recurring service charges and infrastructure maintenance costs to the Government through use of innovative cost arrangements. Such arrangements could include but are not limited to on-demand services such as movies, video games, live sports, and other forms of entertainment. 

System Compatibility: Interested vendors should attend Industry Day on 07 September 2006 at 8:00 am being held at 37 Contracting Squadron, 1655 Selfridge Avenue, Lackland AFB TX.   Vendors shall provide a copy of their capability statement/information and shall be available to provide their capability briefing at that time.  Capability Briefings (one to one sessions) will be held until 12:00 pm on 07 Sep 06.  The capabilities statement/information should include as a minimum a detailed description of your service (including requirements/system compatibility, software and hardware maintenance/modification/upgrade requirements), catalog, brochure, business size (i.e., small business, large business, small disadvantaged business, etc.), and prices (including maintenance costs). All contractors must be FCC registered. Current service delivery infrastructure is not compatible with newer delivery technologies (i.e., satellite television). All responses must address overall infrastructure requirements, if applicable, and address conversion from the NTSC standard to the ATSC standard.   The Government is not liable for any costs and/or activity associated with providing a response to this announcement.

<SOLNBR>N0016406R4810
<RESPDATE>120106
<CONTACT>MS. STACY MCATEE, 812-854-1988
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on line (NECO) site at www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case that FBO is not available.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Division Crane. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division requires Miniature Day/Night Sight subsystems for Crew-Served Weapons (MDNS-CSW).  A five year indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity contract is anticipated; expected quantity is a minimum of 15 units and a maximum of 3000 units.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination NSWC-Crane.  Fifteen (15) units required 150 days from award date of contract with subsequent deliveries at a rate of 200 units every 30 days until order is complete.  Preliminary inspection will occur at source by a Government QAR and final inspection and acceptance will be at destination by NSWC Crane personnel.  This solicitation will be issued on a full and open competition basis using a performance specification. The MDNS-SCW required is a system of common, standardized aiming modules, illumination modules, and mounts that are system-integrated for use on crew-served weapons.  Prior public Market Survey activity on MDNS-SCW occurred pursuant to two previous NSWC Crane announcements: N00164-06-R-4887 WEAPONS QUADRANT MOUNTS (WQM) and N00164-06-R-4803 CREW SERVED AND HEAVY WEAPONS AIMING LASER (CSHWAL).  The original Market Surveys can be downloaded by clicking on the foregoing links; then entering the announcement numbers in the “Search by Solicitation / Award Number” block in the provided form.  No Performance Specification for the WQM is yet prepared.  A Preliminary Draft of the Performance Specification for the CSHWAL, dated April 25th, 2006, remains posted, but is closed for receipt of comments.  Market Survey results and field trials of commercial offerings in July 2006 revealed that no known existing laser meets the requirements for the CSHWAL.  Also revealed was that the future!   CSHWAL and WQMs need to be fully system integrated with a Visible Bright Light-Heavy (VBL-H).  Therefore, NSWC Crane intends to develop a new Performance Specification that unifies the CSHWAL, VBL-H, and WQMs subsystem capabilities into an integrated MDNS-CSW system.  The MDNS-CSW Performance Specification will be published on or about September-October 2006.  When it is published, interested parties are invited to comment on the MDNS-CSW Performance Specification.  The Closing Date for receipt of comments on the MDNS-CSW Performance Specification is Friday, 1 December 2006. NSWC Crane will hold a public pre-solicitation conference for the MDNS-CSW acquisition.  The tentative date for this pre-solicitation conference is Thursday, 19 October 2006, in Indianapolis, Indiana.  Attendees must register for this conference with the Contracting Officer no later than Friday, 15 September 2006.  No additional attendees will be accepted for this conference after Friday, 15 September 2006, in order to accommodate the correct seating capacity at the conference site.     It is expected that the competitive solicitation will require offerors to submit two product samples, technical, past performance and price proposals.  Award will be on a best value basis.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet @ www.ccr.gov. It should be noted that during the course of this acquisition program, the Government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Wexford Group International (WGI) and possibly other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government participants.  This sources sought announcement does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement or incurred for participation in the pre-solicitation conference will NOT be reimbursed.

2.0	Description
The objective of this Request for Information (RFI) announcement is to obtain information on capabilities currently available in the marketplace, based on the requirements outlined, from all interested parties.  Responses to this RFI will assist the Government in determining acquisition strategies. 

2.1	Purpose
The General Services Administration (GSA) is requesting information on the capability of commercial and other entities to provide identity credential services to support public access to Internet-based online government services.  The identity credentials will meet the requirements of the Federal Government?s Assurance Level 1 and Level 2 standards, as defined in Office of Management Budget (OMB) M-04-04 ?E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies,? and as measured in accordance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63 ?Electronic Authentication Guideline:  Recommendations of the National Institute of Standards and Technology,? and the E-Authentication Credential Assessment Framework.?  (See http://www.cio.gov/eauthentication)

GSA is seeking information from multiple categories of identity credential services:  
? Commercial entities for which issuance of identity credentials is currently a supporting activity to enable their customers to gain access and to conduct business with them online. Information is sought about their capabilities and desire to extend the use of those credentials to access Federal Government online services as a value-added capability to their customers. Examples of this category include, but are not limited to banking and financial services, health care services, or insurance services.

? Government and non-government entities that currently issue identity credentials as a supporting activity to enable the public to gain access and to conduct business online.  Information is sought about their capabilities to extend the use of those credentials for access to Government online services as a value-added capability to their existing customers.  Examples of this category include, but are not limited to Federal, State and local governments, educational institutions, associations, and other federations and partnerships. 

? Commercial entities for whom issuance and maintenance of identity credentials is currently a line of business. Information is sought on their capability to provide vendor-owned and managed services to issue compliant identity credentials to the public, manage the credentials throughout the entire lifecycle (i.e., issuance, validation, revocation, renewal), and provide status and other information about the credential when requested by the Federal Government online services.  

2.2	E-Authentication Federation
In 2002, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designated GSA as the lead agency for the E-Authentication Initiative, a cross-cutting initiative of the E-Government component of the President?s Management Agenda.  The E-Authentication Initiative was charged with developing a means of defining the levels of risk associated with online transactions performed between the public and government or between government entities, and to make available a set of common solutions to mitigate that risk.

With the approval of its Executive Steering Committee, a governance body comprised of representatives of the 24 CIO Council agencies, the E-Authentication Initiative elected to pursue a federated approach to identity management to provide a standardized, government-wide means of authenticating users of online government services, thereby reducing the risk of E-Government.  The result was the creation of the E-Authentication Federation, a public-private partnership that enables citizens, businesses and government employees to securely access online government services using log-in IDs issued by trusted third-parties, both within and outside the government.

Government agencies may E-Authentication-enable any Internet-based system that has end users outside the agency?s firewall and requires identity verification of those users.  Once an agency?s system has been E-Authentication-enabled, it becomes a ?relying party,? able to grant access to end users who have an identity credential from one or more of the E-Authentication Federation credential service providers (CSPs).  If end users do not already have a credential from an approved CSP, they may obtain at no cost an approved credential that will be usable to gain access to multiple Federation-member services.

The E-Authentication technical architecture provides the operational infrastructure of the E-Authentication Federation.  The E-Authentication technical architecture is the approved authentication service component of the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) and, as such, is the recommended technical approach for online user authentication for Federal agencies.

As of August 2006, the E-Authentication Federation consists of 13 unique relying parties representing various Federal agencies, and 5 approved credential service providers, which issue and validate the identity credentials that constituents may use to gain access to those services.  The E-Authentication program expects the Federation to expand to an estimated 450+ on-line services by the end of FY11.

2.3	Credential Service Provider Membership
Membership as an E-Authentication Federation Credential Service Provider (CSP) is dependent upon meeting the following requirements:  

? Completion of an Application for assessment
? Provision of an assessment package to the E-Authentication Program Management Office (PMO)
? Undergo credential assessment by E-Authentication PMO
? Submission of attestation documentation 
? Undergo acceptance testing with the E-Authentication Interoperability Laboratory
? Demonstrate operational readiness, including implementation of E-Governance PKI Certificate and exchange of metadata within the Federation 
? Execution of a Credential Service Provider Agreement 

The specific detailed requirements can be found at http://www.gio.gov/eauthentication.

3.0	Functional Requirements
Respondents are requested to provide information in response to the following functional requirements:

? Capability to issue credentials to the public in a manner compliant with requirements specified in NIST SP 800-63 for assurance levels 1 and 2 (i.e., USERID/PIN and/or USERID/Password).
? Compliance with the requirements specified in the ?Password Credential Assessment Profile v2.0.?
? Capability to provide online registration and credential maintenance (i.e., information updates, resets, termination) in a manner compliant with NIST SP 800-63.
? Capability to provide customer support services, including 24x7 help desk services.
? Capability to complete registration and issuance of the identity credentials in a single online session.
? Capability to provide a scalable architecture to support the interface to additional online services as they join the Federation. 
? Capability to provide technical interface with the E-Authentication technical architecture in adopted standard(s), using approved technology products(s).
? Capability to meet the requirements to become a participating member of the E-Authentication Federation.
? Capability to provide physical and logical security for the services provided and for protection of personal and private information related to the public as required by law.

4.0	Architectural Descriptions
Respondents are requested to provide brief architectural descriptions of the identity credential service they provide, including reliability, availability, and scalability characteristics to meet the functional requirements specified in Section 3.0.  If the vendor provides more than one architectural option, then brief descriptions per architecture may be provided.  Descriptions should be no more than five (5) pages per architecture.

Respondents are requested to identify and provide information related to the feasibility and design tradeoffs/implications, if any, in order to meet the functional requirements listed in section 3.0.  This information should be no more than two (2) pages per architecture.

Respondents are requested to identify and provide information related to implementation schedule considerations for each architecture.  This information should be no more than two (2) pages per architecture.

5.0	Cost Information
It is particularly important for the government to be able to understand the cost model for an entity to provide identity management services as described in this RFI.  Respondents are requested to provide cost estimate information for each architecture described in section 4.0 as follows:

? Non-recurring costs, such as initial service costs.
? Annual recurring costs
? Cost drivers ? specific factors that make up the elements of a decision to either offer a service or deploy it for Respondent?s customer base.  Include models and algorithms
? Cost trade-offs
? Respondents should also identify any current GSA Schedules or contracts that would be available for the government to use in obtaining services

Cost information should be provided in no more than three (3) pages per architecture.

6.0	Organizational Expertise

2.0	Description
The objective of this Request for Information (RFI) announcement is to obtain information on capabilities currently available in the marketplace, based on the requirements outlined, from all interested parties.  Responses to this RFI will assist the Government in determining acquisition strategies. 

2.1	Purpose
The General Services Administration (GSA) is requesting information on the capability of commercial and other entities to provide identity credential services to support public access to Internet-based online government services.  The identity credentials will meet the requirements of the Federal Government?s Assurance Level 1 and Level 2 standards, as defined in Office of Management Budget (OMB) M-04-04 ?E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies,? and as measured in accordance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63 ?Electronic Authentication Guideline:  Recommendations of the National Institute of Standards and Technology,? and the E-Authentication Credential Assessment Framework.?  (See http://www.cio.gov/eauthentication)

GSA is seeking information from multiple categories of identity credential services:  
? Commercial entities for which issuance of identity credentials is currently a supporting activity to enable their customers to gain access and to conduct business with them online. Information is sought about their capabilities and desire to extend the use of those credentials to access Federal Government online services as a value-added capability to their customers. Examples of this category include, but are not limited to banking and financial services, health care services, or insurance services.

? Government and non-government entities that currently issue identity credentials as a supporting activity to enable the public to gain access and to conduct business online.  Information is sought about their capabilities to extend the use of those credentials for access to Government online services as a value-added capability to their existing customers.  Examples of this category include, but are not limited to Federal, State and local governments, educational institutions, associations, and other federations and partnerships. 

? Commercial entities for whom issuance and maintenance of identity credentials is currently a line of business. Information is sought on their capability to provide vendor-owned and managed services to issue compliant identity credentials to the public, manage the credentials throughout the entire lifecycle (i.e., issuance, validation, revocation, renewal), and provide status and other information about the credential when requested by the Federal Government online services.  

2.2	E-Authentication Federation
In 2002, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designated GSA as the lead agency for the E-Authentication Initiative, a cross-cutting initiative of the E-Government component of the President?s Management Agenda.  The E-Authentication Initiative was charged with developing a means of defining the levels of risk associated with online transactions performed between the public and government or between government entities, and to make available a set of common solutions to mitigate that risk.

With the approval of its Executive Steering Committee, a governance body comprised of representatives of the 24 CIO Council agencies, the E-Authentication Initiative elected to pursue a federated approach to identity management to provide a standardized, government-wide means of authenticating users of online government services, thereby reducing the risk of E-Government.  The result was the creation of the E-Authentication Federation, a public-private partnership that enables citizens, businesses and government employees to securely access online government services using log-in IDs issued by trusted third-parties, both within and outside the government.

Government agencies may E-Authentication-enable any Internet-based system that has end users outside the agency?s firewall and requires identity verification of those users.  Once an agency?s system has been E-Authentication-enabled, it becomes a ?relying party,? able to grant access to end users who have an identity credential from one or more of the E-Authentication Federation credential service providers (CSPs).  If end users do not already have a credential from an approved CSP, they may obtain at no cost an approved credential that will be usable to gain access to multiple Federation-member services.

The E-Authentication technical architecture provides the operational infrastructure of the E-Authentication Federation.  The E-Authentication technical architecture is the approved authentication service component of the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) and, as such, is the recommended technical approach for online user authentication for Federal agencies.

As of August 2006, the E-Authentication Federation consists of 13 unique relying parties representing various Federal agencies, and 5 approved credential service providers, which issue and validate the identity credentials that constituents may use to gain access to those services.  The E-Authentication program expects the Federation to expand to an estimated 450+ on-line services by the end of FY11.

2.3	Credential Service Provider Membership
Membership as an E-Authentication Federation Credential Service Provider (CSP) is dependent upon meeting the following requirements:  

? Completion of an Application for assessment
? Provision of an assessment package to the E-Authentication Program Management Office (PMO)
? Undergo credential assessment by E-Authentication PMO
? Submission of attestation documentation 
? Undergo acceptance testing with the E-Authentication Interoperability Laboratory
? Demonstrate operational readiness, including implementation of E-Governance PKI Certificate and exchange of metadata within the Federation 
? Execution of a Credential Service Provider Agreement 

The specific detailed requirements can be found at http://www.gio.gov/eauthentication.

3.0	Functional Requirements
Respondents are requested to provide information in response to the following functional requirements:

? Capability to issue credentials to the public in a manner compliant with requirements specified in NIST SP 800-63 for assurance levels 1 and 2 (i.e., USERID/PIN and/or USERID/Password).
? Compliance with the requirements specified in the ?Password Credential Assessment Profile v2.0.?
? Capability to provide online registration and credential maintenance (i.e., information updates, resets, termination) in a manner compliant with NIST SP 800-63.
? Capability to provide customer support services, including 24x7 help desk services.
? Capability to complete registration and issuance of the identity credentials in a single online session.
? Capability to provide a scalable architecture to support the interface to additional online services as they join the Federation.

2.0	Description
The objective of this Request for Information (RFI) announcement is to obtain information on capabilities currently available in the marketplace, based on the requirements outlined, from all interested parties.  Responses to this RFI will assist the Government in determining acquisition strategies. 

2.1	Purpose
The General Services Administration (GSA) is requesting information on the capability of commercial and other entities to provide identity credential services to support public access to Internet-based online government services.  The identity credentials will meet the requirements of the Federal Government?s Assurance Level 1 and Level 2 standards, as defined in Office of Management Budget (OMB) M-04-04 ?E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies,? and as measured in accordance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63 ?Electronic Authentication Guideline:  Recommendations of the National Institute of Standards and Technology,? and the E-Authentication Credential Assessment Framework.?  (See http://www.cio.gov/eauthentication)

GSA is seeking information from multiple categories of identity credential services:  
? Commercial entities for which issuance of identity credentials is currently a supporting activity to enable their customers to gain access and to conduct business with them online. Information is sought about their capabilities and desire to extend the use of those credentials to access Federal Government online services as a value-added capability to their customers. Examples of this category include, but are not limited to banking and financial services, health care services, or insurance services.

? Government and non-government entities that currently issue identity credentials as a supporting activity to enable the public to gain access and to conduct business online.  Information is sought about their capabilities to extend the use of those credentials for access to Government online services as a value-added capability to their existing customers.  Examples of this category include, but are not limited to Federal, State and local governments, educational institutions, associations, and other federations and partnerships. 

? Commercial entities for whom issuance and maintenance of identity credentials is currently a line of business. Information is sought on their capability to provide vendor-owned and managed services to issue compliant identity credentials to the public, manage the credentials throughout the entire lifecycle (i.e., issuance, validation, revocation, renewal), and provide status and other information about the credential when requested by the Federal Government online services.  

2.2	E-Authentication Federation
In 2002, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designated GSA as the lead agency for the E-Authentication Initiative, a cross-cutting initiative of the E-Government component of the President?s Management Agenda.  The E-Authentication Initiative was charged with developing a means of defining the levels of risk associated with online transactions performed between the public and government or between government entities, and to make available a set of common solutions to mitigate that risk.

With the approval of its Executive Steering Committee, a governance body comprised of representatives of the 24 CIO Council agencies, the E-Authentication Initiative elected to pursue a federated approach to identity management to provide a standardized, government-wide means of authenticating users of online government services, thereby reducing the risk of E-Government.  The result was the creation of the E-Authentication Federation, a public-private partnership that enables citizens, businesses and government employees to securely access online government services using log-in IDs issued by trusted third-parties, both within and outside the government.

Government agencies may E-Authentication-enable any Internet-based system that has end users outside the agency?s firewall and requires identity verification of those users.  Once an agency?s system has been E-Authentication-enabled, it becomes a ?relying party,? able to grant access to end users who have an identity credential from one or more of the E-Authentication Federation credential service providers (CSPs).  If end users do not already have a credential from an approved CSP, they may obtain at no cost an approved credential that will be usable to gain access to multiple Federation-member services.

The E-Authentication technical architecture provides the operational infrastructure of the E-Authentication Federation.  The E-Authentication technical architecture is the approved authentication service component of the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) and, as such, is the recommended technical approach for online user authentication for Federal agencies.

As of August 2006, the E-Authentication Federation consists of 13 unique relying parties representing various Federal agencies, and 5 approved credential service providers, which issue and validate the identity credentials that constituents may use to gain access to those services.  The E-Authentication program expects the Federation to expand to an estimated 450+ on-line services by the end of FY11.

2.3	Credential Service Provider Membership
Membership as an E-Authentication Federation Credential Service Provider (CSP) is dependent upon meeting the following requirements:  

? Completion of an Application for assessment
? Provision of an assessment package to the E-Authentication Program Management Office (PMO)
? Undergo credential assessment by E-Authentication PMO
? Submission of attestation documentation 
? Undergo acceptance testing with the E-Authentication Interoperability Laboratory
? Demonstrate operational readiness, including implementation of E-Governance PKI Certificate and exchange of metadata within the Federation 
? Execution of a Credential Service Provider Agreement 

The specific detailed requirements can be found at http://www.gio.gov/eauthentication.

3.0	Functional Requirements
Respondents are requested to provide information in response to the following functional requirements:

? Capability to issue credentials to the public in a manner compliant with requirements specified in NIST SP 800-63 for assurance levels 1 and 2 (i.e., USERID/PIN and/or USERID/Password).
? Compliance with the requirements specified in the ?Password Credential Assessment Profile v2.0.?
? Capability to provide online registration and credential maintenance (i.e., information updates, resets, termination) in a manner compliant with NIST SP 800-63.
? Capability to provide customer support services, including 24x7 help desk services.
? Capability to complete registration and issuance of the identity credentials in a single online session.
? Capability to provide a scalable architecture to support the interface to additional online services as they join the Federation. 
? Capability to provide technical interface with the E-Authentication technical architecture in adopted standard(s), using approved technology products(s).
? Capability to meet the requirements to become a participating member of the E-Authentication Federation.
? Capability to provide physical and logical security for the services provided and for protection of personal and private information related to the public as required by law.

4.0	Architectural Descriptions
Respondents are requested to provide brief architectural descriptions of the identity credential service they provide, including reliability, availability, and scalability characteristics to meet the functional requirements specified in Section 3.0.  If the vendor provides more than one architectural option, then brief descriptions per architecture may be provided.  Descriptions should be no more than five (5) pages per architecture.

Respondents are requested to identify and provide information related to the feasibility and design tradeoffs/implications, if any, in order to meet the functional requirements listed in section 3.0.  This information should be no more than two (2) pages per architecture.

Respondents are requested to identify and provide information related to implementation schedule considerations for each architecture.  This information should be no more than two (2) pages per architecture.

5.0	Cost Information
It is particularly important for the government to be able to understand the cost model for an entity to provide identity management services as described in this RFI.  Respondents are requested to provide cost estimate information for each architecture described in section 4.0 as follows:

? Non-recurring costs, such as initial service costs.
? Annual recurring costs
? Cost drivers ? specific factors that make up the elements of a decision to either offer a service or deploy it for Respondent?s customer base.  Include models and algorithms
? Cost trade-offs
? Respondents should also identify any current GSA Schedules or contracts that would be available for the government to use in obtaining services

Cost information should be provided in no more than three (3) pages per architecture.

<SUBJECT>R -- R - - Career Transition Training Services
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) intends to negotiate with Career Management International (CMI), Houston, TX, to provide Career Transition Training Services to DARPA Staff.  This task includes analysis, assessment, and evaluation of the development of an integrated DARPA Staff transition program focused on providing Career Transition Training services for departing DARPA Staff.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 in that there is a reasonable basis to conclude that (1) the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by CMI with its unique capabilities, and (2) award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements for transition planning.  Duration of this effort will be 36 months (including two one-year options).  No solicitation is available and requests for same will not receive a response; however, all responsible sources may identify their interest by submitting a statement of capability to respond to the requirement.  Although this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, all capability statements received within thirty days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. See Government-Wide Numbered Notes 25 and 26.

BIDS MUST BE VALID FOR 30 DAYS AFTER COMPETITION CLOSE. FOB DESTINATION CONUS This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of purchasing a High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements in regard to contractual obligations concerning the lease and building property management office’s approval of the installation of the High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System in SA-34, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  Equipment listed above is required to provide maximum warehousing capabilities in a limited space to support the Department of State’s enterprise network distribution systems installations, modifications, and moves worldwide. The Installations Branch has painstakingly complied with Boston Properties requirements with regard to the National Office Systems’ High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System as designed for this specific government leased location. IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL presented a design for a High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System for SA-34 (7374 Boston Blvd, Springfield, VA) to Boston Properties Management Office for approval as a modification to a building or office space managed by Boston Properties on May 5, 2006.  Because Boston Properties has approved the original design submittal; there are Fairfax County Building Permits to obtain and County Codes to adhere to; and the lengthy process and inspection procedures involved with the installation of a High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System – the National Office Systems’ High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System should be purchased as currently approved by Boston Properties.   The purchase of a nearly comparable rolling warehouse rack system or substitute may be cause to restart the approval process from the beginning and delay the county permit issuance and inspection processes.

A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs.  Inclusion of FAM and FAH material within the search will significantly enhance the power of the search for users by providing links directly to current versions of regulations and guidance, eliminating the need to update links within the Ask Admin Knowledgebase when FAM and FAH material is reissued or reorganized, as was the case when 6 FAM and 6 FAH were expanded into three additional FAM/FAH volumes – 14 FAM/FAH, 15 FAM/FAH, and 16 FAM/FAH.   4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited (for sole source acquisitions; also required for unusual and compelling urgency where more than one offer will not be solicited).  IRM and HR have already purchased 3 Metastorm modules and A/GSSI would like to purchase the remaining 2 modules that are part of the eWorks suite.  These modules will provide additional functionality (metrics and business modeling) that will work in conjunction with the previously purchased modules (Process designer, automation engine and Manager).  Since the Department of State, via IRM and HR, have already made an investment in this particular workflow project, we want to continue to leverage this existing investment rather than work with another vendor and start from scratch with another suite that would not be compatible with existing efforts.  We are also purchasing additional user licenses that will also complement previously purchased licenses and which will allow A/GSSI to work with our OIP and overseas customers on process automation.  In addition, the purchase order includes some consulting hours to help us get up and running via a rapid development mode so that we can maximize our investment in a short timeframe.  No other company sells this software.

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial supplies prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items and FAR 13.106 Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This combined synopsis/solicitation will result in a firm fixed price commercial supply contract.  (ii) Simplified procurement procedures will be used for this acquisition per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13.  This requirement is being issued as an unrestricted full and open competition; therefore, any responsible business may submit an offer.  (iii) This requirement is for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN), an association of Veterinary Diagnostic labs which have been authorized by the USDA APHIS Veterinary Services to perform certain diagnostic tests for VS surveillance programs and in the event of a disease outbreak. (iv) This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  (v) The provisions and clauses incorporated into this solicitation document are those in effect at the time of publication.  Provisions and clauses incorporated by reference have the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  The full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) can be accessed on the Internet at http://www.arnet.gov/far/ (vi) REQUIREMENT AND QUANTITIES: This requirement consists of three line items:  
CLIN 01  - Seven (7) Magnetic Particle Processors for 96-well plate DNA/RNA Extraction and the complete equipment components for each piece of equipment to perform the processes described below in section (x) CLIN 02  Shipping of the equipment to the FOB destination.  CLIN 03  Travel to the sites to install and start up the equipment as well as train the staff on the use of the equipment. Travel costs will be reimbursed at the rates provided in the Federal Travel or Joint Federal Travel Regulations and travel must be in accordance with Federal Government Travel Regulations.   (vii) This equipment will be distributed to multiple laboratory locations within the United States to enhance the diagnostic testing capacity of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network.  It may be requested that the equipment be delivered to separate NAHLN laboratory locations, depending on the timeframe of delivery.  The selected manufacturer must be able to deliver all requested systems within three (3) months of order placement.  Deliverables and acceptance of deliverables will be FOB destination.  The destinations for all 7 magnetic particle processors are to be determined at a later date.  Exact destinations for the deliverables will be provided by the end of September. (viii) The PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE for this contract is from date of award through delivery of all the equipment. The contractor shall provide delivery of all equipment no later than November 30, 2006. (ix) OBJECTIVES: The diagnostic tests performed by the NAHLN have been validated for specific pieces of laboratory equipment and sets of diagnostic reagents.  The NAHLN laboratories are expected to only perform the diagnostic tests according to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that outline the type of equipment and reagents to use.  The current goal of the NAHLN is to increase diagnostic testing capacity and capability for Foreign Animal Diseases (FADs) to enhance veterinary diagnostic preparedness in the event of a FAD outbreak in domestic livestock or poultry.  With the elevated national concern and apprehension of the introduction of highly pathogenic Avian Influenza into the United States, the NAHLN has been directed by the USDA to double the current diagnostic testing capacity for the real time RT-PCR (real time Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction) assay.  The NAHLN will accomplish this goal by providing laboratory equipment to approved NAHLN laboratories that increase the platform for the real time RT-PCR assay from single wells to 96 well plates.  One specific piece of necessary equipment is a magnetic particle processor capable of automatically performing the sample preparation steps of DNA/RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) extraction in the 96 well plate format. This statement of work is to define a semi-automated system for performing the 96 well plate platform viral RNA extraction method on the Avian Influenza real time RT-PCR assay.  Although this process can be accomplished manually, it is more efficient for the laboratory performing this assay if a piece of laboratory equipment performs the steps of this extraction process.  (x) TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:  Each magnetic particle processor must meet the following technical specifications in order to be technically acceptable. 
Because the approved extraction kit for the 96 well plate uses the Ambion-R MagMAXtm paramagnetic beads, the selected equipment must be a magnetic particle processor. Must be able to process Ambion-R MagMAXtm paramagnetic beads included in the AI/ND Viral RNA Isolation Kit.
Must be able to utilize a 96-well microplate for PCR applications
Must allow processing through a minimum of 5 reagents (lysis, purification, elution, etc.)
Must allow software programming functionality for multiple protocols and multiple processing steps in each protocol including: incubation, capture / collection of paramagnetic beads, washing with rinse solution, elution of purified material from magnetic beads, and transfer of purified material into 96-well PCR amplification plate.
Must be able to shake/agitate contents of each well during incubation 
Software must be compatible with Microsoft XP operating system
Must achieve at least 90% collection recovery of the magnetic particles in each well at each process step
Must not allow carry over of reagents from plate to plate or cross contamination of beads from well to well.
Must be able to process one plate of 96 samples through the complete procedure in 30 - 45 minutes. 
Must have a 1 year warranty for all parts, labor, travel and include installation, start up training, and support for validated applications.  The contractor must include in their services, travel to the sites to install and start up the equipment and train the staff on the use of the equipment. 
The magnetic particle processor must be able to manipulate multiple 96 well plates filled with different reagent solutions so that the paramagnetic beads (with viral RNA bound to them) can be lifted from one reagent plate to another.  There can be no mixing of materials (reagents or beads) from one well to another on the same plate.  This is typically accomplished with a magnetic particle processor head that contains 96 magnetic rods.   Therefore a separate magnetic rod will contact each separate well on the 96 well plate. In addition to the technical specifications described above, the magnetic particle processor must be able to perform the following protocols are listed here: (a) insert a protective covering over each of the magnetic rods i.e. plastic tip cover; (b) allow for the 96 well initial sample plate to be loaded into the equipment; (c) allow a 4 minute incubation and gentle mixing cycle for the initial sample plate with lysis buffer, magnetic beads, and diagnostic samples to allow viral RNA binding - total well volume of 171ul; (d) collect the beads from each well from the initial viral RNA binding step and allow 2 minutes for capture;  (d) transfer and release the beads into to a plate with the wash solution I and allow to incubate and gently mix for 30 seconds - total well volume of 100ul; (e) collect the beads from each well from the wash solution I step and allow 1 minute for capture;    (f) transfer and release the beads into a plate with wash solution II and allow to incubate and gently mix for 30 seconds - total well volume of 100ul; (g) collect the beads from each well from the wash solution II step and allow 1 minute for capture; (h) transfer and release the beads into a second plate with wash solution II and allow to incubate and gently mix for 30 seconds - total well volume of 100ul; (i) collect the beads from each well from the second wash solution II step and allow 1 minute for capture; (j) allow the beads to dry for 2-5 minutes by shaking in open air; (k) transfer and release the beads into a final plate with the elution buffer solution and allow to incubate with gentle mixing for 4 minutes - total well volume of 50ul; (l) collect the beads from each well from the final elution step and allow 2 minutes for capture; (m) discard the beads and protective magnetic rod coverings into a separate container.

STATEMENT OF WORK IS AS FOLLOWS:

STATEMENT OF WORK

ATTESTATION ENGAGEMENT and PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR 
USDOL'S INTERNATIONAL CHILD LABOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

I.	INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this contract is to obtain Advisory and Assistance Services to meet on-going needs of the ILAB International Child Labor Program (ICLP) on attestation engagement and Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) issues.  

Applicants should submit proposals addressing the objective(s) identified in the Introduction (Section I), the scope of work (Section II), and identified delivery requirements (Section IV).  

A.	Background

USDOL's International Child Labor Program (ICLP), within the Bureau of International Labor Affairs conducts research on international child labor, administers grant and contracts to organizations engaged in efforts to eliminate exploitive child labor, and raises awareness about this important international child labor issue.  

The ICLP's grant administration responsibilities have grown quickly since 1995. ICLP has administered some 180 child labor projects in over 70 countries around the world through: 1) the International Labor Organization's International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (ILO/IPEC); and 2) various organizations that implement Child Labor Education Initiative projects to expand access to basic quality education in areas with a high incidence of child labor.	

The demands for increased accountability in both the financial and performance arenas have grown significantly with the expansion in the numbers of ICLP projects in operation throughout the developing world.  To address these demands, ICLP initiated a project level attestation engagement program in FY 2005 to examine the timeliness and accuracy of grantee GPRA data, financial reporting and compliance USDOL and USG regulations.  The program has contracted under a Blanket Purchase Agreement with an accounting firm to perform attestation engagements of its cooperative agreements in accordance with the Government Auditing Standards published by the Government Accountability Office.  The ICLP has also negotiated with the External Auditor for the International Labor Organization (ILO) to conduct attestation engagements of the projects that ICLP funds through the ILO.  This advisory services contract will provide expert advice and training to ICLP employees to ensure that:  1) the work conducted under the BPA and by the ILO External Auditor meets ICLP?s needs and that the quality is acceptable under the relevant professional standards; 2) project level compliance and GPRA performance data reviews conducted by ICLP staff are performed in an efficient and effective manner.

The numbers and complexity of ICLP projects, as well as the evolution of GPRA requirements under the budget and performance integration initiative of the President's Management Agenda and OMB's Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) also require that ICLP obtain the services of a contractor with expertise in the performance management arena.  In particular, the program is measuring and reporting on its cost efficiency.  The contractor will assist ICLP in refining its measurement approaches, assist ILAB in setting and achieving new efficiency targets, and offer guidance on using the efficiency measures to improve ICLP decision making.  In addition, the consultant will be needed to advise ICLP on assessing Education Initiative (EI) performance data and provide assistance to the program in revising the measures or data collection procedures, if warranted, to ensure that the performance data accurately and validly measure the outcomes of the EI projects.

If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

This solicitation number is RFQ60068 and solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-11.     This is a total small business set-aside. The NAICS is 541690 with a size standard of $6.5 million.  Delivery and acceptance will be at Bethesda, Maryland.

A.	The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has a requirement for an evaluation of the level of usage of the NIDA Goes Back to School (NGBTS) National Dissemination Campaign.   The purpose of this evaluation is to determine the level of use by requestors of the NGBTS materials.  NIDA is presently developing a questionnaire to collect this via a Web survey, and is preparing a Supporting Statement to obtain OMB clearance for compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act.  To conduct this evaluation, NIDA requires the assistance of an experienced contractor to conduct the Web survey of requestors, and to analyze the information collected.

 The key study questions of this evaluation are: 1. Are the NGBTS materials disseminated being used by school personnel requestors, and by community leader requestors? 2. What has been the difference in use level in each year of the campaign? 3. Is there a difference in use level between those requestors responding to a campaign activity and those requestors who were not intervened by campaign activities? 4. What barriers to use of the materials are being reported by requestors?  The primary source information being proposed will have an inherent limitation due to memory recall, especially for the earliest year of the campaign. Secondary source information, from the requestor forms, will be used to verify information from the earliest year(s), and to determine its usability in the evaluation.  In addition, 
1.	The contractor shall conduct the information collection and analysis of the information using methodology agreed to by the IC staff. The contractor shall use all necessary methods to ensure that evaluation questions are answered based on the information collected. 

2.	The contractor shall submit, as part of the proposal, a preliminary implementation plan and briefing statement on the database, for the evaluation services to be provided based on the information provided in this Statement of Work. 

3.	The following is a list of required tasks for completion of this contract. This list is not all-inclusive. The tasks are listed sequentially; however, several tasks will be done concurrently, and some tasks will be continued throughout the entire contract period. 

Specifically, the contractor shall:

Task 1.    The contractor will present a briefing statement to the NIDA Project Officer and IC staff, on the database of the requestors and the items of information in the database of relevance to the evaluation. Based on the contractor?s experience with the database, the potential gaps in the available information will be described, a description of how the contractor works with the gaps in the information analysis presently being conducted will be provided. The contractor will provide a brief work plan to describe how the evaluation services will be conducted, and a preliminary analysis plan.
 
Task 2.    The contractor will draft a sampling plan for random sampling from the database of requestors who ordered materials in the years of the campaign. The sampling plan will include sampling of intervened requestors, and of non-intervened requestors.  Stratified sampling will be used as necessary, to ensure adequate representation among the different sub-group comparisons that NIDA will need to answer the evaluation questions. The sampling plan will be designed to yield accurate information with the appropriate representation of the population and its characteristics such as the geographic regions/socioeconomic regions that the requestors are located in. The sampling plan will minimize non-response error.

Task 3.   The contractor will conduct sample selection from the database according to the sampling plan.  Based on its experience with these groups of requestors the contractor will use its expertise for maximizing response rates and dealing with non-responses, as necessary for a one-time participation event. 
 
Task 4.  The contractor will review the questionnaires prepared by NIDA for the school personnel and community leader requestors, and make recommendations to the IC staff, based on the experience with Internet survey taking and response rates.  The contractor will finalize the questionnaires with the revisions as needed, on information from the pilot tests of the instruments and as advised by NIDA project staff.

Task 5.   The contractor will draft the email request to participate in the survey for review by the NIDA Project Officer, and will make revisions to the email request as necessary. 

Task 6.  Upon NIDA obtaining OMB clearance, the contractor will upload the finalized questionnaires into the web survey tool to be used in the study. 

Task 7.  The contractor will conduct the survey. The contractor will review the incoming response forms to track incomplete forms needing a subsequent email request, and to track non-respondents. The contractor will conduct accuracy checks for consistency in the responses and to minimize response error to the extent possible. Such items as name of requestor, place of employment, could be matched on information in the requestor forms used in the study.  Non-matches will be tracked for reconciliation. Based on the contractor?s experience with the requestor population, subsequent email requests will be sent to participants for reconciliation or phone calls will be made if a contact number is provided. Response forms with irreconciliable error will be excluded from the study.   

Task 8. The contractor will prepare the information for analysis.  Analyses will be conducted blinded and in the aggregate. Excel formats will be prepared for extracting information from the response forms, to maximize accuracy, consistency, and standardization in extraction for the anticipated quantitative and qualitative analyses. The contractor will develop a database of the survey information, blinded for all personal identification of the requestors. 

Task 9.   The contractor will conduct analyses of the blinded information. Analyses will be focused to answer the evaluation questions. Descriptive quantitative analyses will be conducted. Qualitative information will be analyzed using qualitative methods that will be appropriate for the information and relevant to the purpose of information collected.  The contractor will work with IC staff to determine the most appropriate analytic methods needed for the information obtained. The contractor will conduct the analyses. The analyses will be reviewed by IC staff and make recommendations as necessary. The contractor will incorporate recommendations, and summarize the results from analyses in a PowerPoint presentation and a final report. 
    	All information materials developed pursuant to this contract are the property of the U.S. Government and fall within the purview of the Freedom of Information Act. The contractor is enjoined against unauthorized release of the facts, findings, and written materials from this contract without the expressed, written authorization of the Task Leader. 

Each deliverable shall include, at a minimum, information as described in each task above. For the purpose of this schedule, week 1 shall be considered to be the first week after the contract award date.

<BR>                 EL =  100  *                  Scheduled Use Time (SUT)(hours)

<BR><BR>All times will be accrued in 15 minute increments and rounded up to the next highest number of hours when computing the monthly effectiveness level.  Further, if any period of Operation Use Time (OUT) of less than three hours duration is immediately preceded and followed by periods of Down Time, and the CR determines that those Down Times were related, that the period OUT will be considered as Down Time in computing the monthly effectiveness level (EL).  EL will be truncated to an integer number.  Times are defined as follows:
<BR><BR>             OUT: Scheduled Use Time (SUT) minus down Time.  Time, accumulated in complete 15 minute intervals, during which the contractor maintained system/equipment is considered available. 
<BR><BR>             SUT: Time during which the contractor maintained system/equipment is scheduled by the Government for operation use.  Scheduled and unscheduled time out are not included in SUT.
<BR><BR>             Scheduled Time Out (STO): time during which the contractor maintained system/equipment is unavailable for operational use.  The Government designated CR or other authorized personnel may establish STO.  The contractor's manager or other authorized personnel may establish STO for Preventative Maintenance (PM) with prior concurrence of the government CR, at least 24 hours prior to commencement of STO.
<BR><BR>            Unscheduled Time Out (UTO):  Time during which the contractor maintained system/equipment is unavailable for operational use due to environmental conditions beyond the control of the contractor and the Government, such as hazardous weather conditions, or failure of Government provided facilities or services which are required  for continued operation of the system/equipment, such as physical access to the building containing the system/equipment, or electrical power loss to a system/equipment not connected to the UPS at the MSRC.  UTO shall be recorded after the fact by Government representative in the System Maintenance Event Log for the MSRC, and requires concurrence of the Government's CR or their designated representative. 
<BR><BR>             Down Time:  Time during which the contractor maintained system/equipment is not available for operational use.  Down Time can only occur during Scheduled Use Time.  Down Time for one contractor maintained system/equipment may result in Down Time for additional contractor maintained system(s)/equipment(s) which depend on that system/equipment for continued operation.  A system/equipment will be considered unavailable for use during an entire 15 minute interval if it is unavailable of used during any portion of the interval.  Down Time shall be record by the Government representative in the System Maintenance Event Log for the MSRC. 

<BR><BR>The contractor shall maintain equipment under the contract at a monthly effectiveness level of 98%, at a minimum, for each system/equipment identified.  If the effectiveness level for a system/equipment drops below 98%, the contractor shall grant a 100% maintenance credit.  Maintenance credits will be taken as a discount from the monthly amount due the contractor.  Downtime will be accumulated for the month and rounded off to the next higher hour.

There are two separate tasks contained herein.  The contractor(s) shall each process histological sections from a minimum of two corals. One contractor will process a branching coral (Pocillopora or Porites spp.) and plating coral (Monitopora spp.), and the second will process a branching coral (Acropora, Seriatophora or Stylophora) and massive coral (Porites, Favia or Favites). The contractor(s) will then work together to each identify and bring together 6 representatives with expertise on coral histology to a one week long meeting to discuss and annotate slides and produce an electronic digital atlas.  All of the slides and embedded blocks of tissue produced during the contract period will be submitted to the NOAA/CDHC International Coral Registry of Pathology for archiving.

Task 1)  Procurement of histological slides of healthy and diseased coral tissue with accompanying annotation for IndoPacific corals

PURPOSE:  Services are needed to accomplish tasks as a part of the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program coral disease efforts identified in the Coral Disease and Health Consortium?s (CDHC) National Research Plan, to which NOAA has committed its support.  Specifically, the contractor will contribute to NOAA?s development of a reference collection of histological sections of coral tissue for representative Pacific coral species. The contractor will:
?	Provide sets of histological slides of at least two Pacific coral species that typify branching and plating morphologies; Slides will be stained with appropriate histological stains to reveal morphological features to distinguish cell types and anatomical systems at light microscopy levels and accompanied with annotations of the various morphological and anatomical features. 
?	Identify six experts in coral histology and bring them together in a week-long session to review the slides and annotate the histological features with accepted cnidarian terminology.
?	Develop an electronic atlas of representative slides and cellular features.


SCHEDULE: Defined on a task order basis.  Stained slides may be delivered in batches that consist of multiples of 25.  

SCOPE OF WORK:
1.	Produce high quality (i.e., complete fixation, even thickness, even staining, intact tissue sections) histological sections of voucher (i.e., type) species of Pacific scleractinan coral.  Examples of acceptable species are representatives of the genus Pocillopora, Porites and Montipora including  branching Pocillopora meandrina, Porites compressa, and Pocillopora damicornis, and plating Montipora spp., 
2.	Provide tissue sections that are oriented in various planes of view with respect to the polyp longitudinal axis.  These shall include 1) Transverse (or axial) sections (i.e., run top (superior, oral) to bottom (inferior, aboral) from the tentacles to the basal disk perpendicular to the longitudinal axis (also may be referred to as cross-sections); 2) Sagittal sections which be cut parallel to the longitudinal axis (i.e., from one side of the body to the other the whole length; and 3) representative Oblique sections of the polyps.
3.	Tissue sections shall be stained with appropriate histological dyes to visualize cell and tissue composition and structure that include but are not limited to elements of the integument, digestive, musculoskeletal, reproductive, nervous, endocrine and immune/defense systems.
4.	Digitized versions of representative slides of tissue from each biological system (see #3) shall be annotated as to anatomical location, system components and cellular and structural features and subcellular elements (i.e., nucleus, ER, Golgi, lysosome, peroxisomes, mitochondria etc) representing normal histology of the type-species of coral.
5.	We expect the scope of our project to be in the order of 150-300 slides for a Pacific type-species of coral with branching morphology and 150-300 slides for a type-species of coral with mounding morphology.  

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The contractor shall perform the specified tasks from August 31, 2006 to March 31, 2008.  The resulting purchase order(s) shall be negotiated on a firm fixed price.  The budgeted amount for each of these task, task 1 above and task 2 below is approximately $24,950 each.  

DELIVERABLES/TASK 1:

BIDS MUST BE VALID FOR 30 DAYS AFTER COMPETITION CLOSE. FOB DESTINATION CONUS This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of purchasing a High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements in regard to contractual obligations concerning the lease and building property management office’s approval of the installation of the High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System in SA-34, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  Equipment listed above is required to provide maximum warehousing capabilities in a limited space to support the Department of State’s enterprise network distribution systems installations, modifications, and moves worldwide. The Installations Branch has painstakingly complied with Boston Properties requirements with regard to the National Office Systems’ High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System as designed for this specific government leased location. IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL presented a design for a High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System for SA-34 (7374 Boston Blvd, Springfield, VA) to Boston Properties Management Office for approval as a modification to a building or office space managed by Boston Properties on May 5, 2006.  Because Boston Properties has approved the original design submittal; there are Fairfax County Building Permits to obtain and County Codes to adhere to; and the lengthy process and inspection procedures involved with the installation of a High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System – the National Office Systems’ High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System should be purchased as currently approved by Boston Properties.   The purchase of a nearly comparable rolling warehouse rack system or substitute may be cause to restart the approval process from the beginning and delay the county permit issuance and inspection processes.

Identify the Agency, Contracting Activity and Requiring Office. The Office of Acquisition, Department of State is processing this acquisition at the request of Diplomatic Telecommunications Service – Program Office. 2.	Describe the action being approved. It is the intention of this contract to obtain material and installation services for 5 computer server racks with integrated 20KW UPS with N+1 redundancy, A (UPS) and B (building raw power) dual power distribution, interconnection wiring, cable management, to support DTSPO Enterprise Network Management System (ENMS) 3.  Describe the Supplies / Services required (including estimated value). This expansion of computer server rack capacity is required to support major renovations of computer server systems, including replacement of current ENMS software and hardware with a new suite of systems. The new racks will provide needed high power quality and cabling infrastructure for the high reliability requirement ENMS function. Our previous ad hoc acquisition of racks, UPS systems and cabling systems resulted in messy, difficult to manage layout with vulnerabilities to operator error (miscabling, loss of power,) and poor power quality.   -	2 – 4.	 Demonstrate that the proposed Contractor’s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires the use of the authorities cited. APC is a manufacturer of UPS systems and also of rack systems. Other vendors manufacture some or no components, and simply bolt together components obtained from other manufacturers, resulting in a less integrated and reliable system. Most will rebrand UPS systems (frequently obtained from APC). Purchase approach of buying single-sourced integrated systems eliminates need for Government to do detailed design and integration of rack systems, saving labor cost and time and increasing system quality. 5.   Describe the results of any market survey conducted or the reason why  markets survey was not conducted. Market survey was made for similar integrated racks/UPS/power distribution/cable management system and none was found to be comparable in functionality or price. Arab League Boycott of Israel (Aug 1999) (a) Definitions. As used in this provision: "Foreign person" means any person other than a United States person as defined below. "United States person" means any United States resident or national (other than an individual resident outside the United States and employed by other than a United States person), any domestic concern (including any permanent domestic establishment of any foreign concern), and any foreign subsidiary or affiliate (including any permanent foreign establishment) of any domestic concern which is controlled in fact by such domestic concern, as provided under the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended. (b) Certification. By submitting this offer, the offeror certifies that it is not: (1) Taking or knowingly agreeing to take any action, with respect to the boycott of Israel by Arab League countries, which Section 8(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)) prohibits a United States person from taking; or, (2) Discriminating in the award of subcontracts on the basis of religion. "The terms and conditions of the Prompt Payment Act ( P.L. 97-177 as amended) and OMB CIRCULAR A-125 as amended, FOB ORIGIN, are applicable to this order. The vendor should expect payment within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the vendor's invoice by the Department of State, DTSPO, for the purposes of determining a payment due date and the date on which interest will begin to accrue.

<DESC>This amendment to RFP HSTS03-06-R-CAO092 provides the results of the Industry Day held at TSA HQ on 5/24/06.  Below you will find a list of all questions asked and their answers. Additionally, if you would like a copy of the Industry Day sign-in sheet and the Industry Day PowerPoint presentation, you may contact Robyn King at robyn.king@dhs.gov or Marvin Grubbs at marvin.grubbs@dhs.gov no later than 7 June 2006 at 2:00pm EST.  

Any additional questions submitted in writing to the primary or secondary POC will collectively be posted 14 June 2006 via FedBizOpps.

The following are the questions and answers from Industry Day.  

1.  Regarding the incumbent, what contract vehicle is currently in place?

Currently a GSA Task Order off the MOBIS schedule is in place and is priced per deliverable.  It has been decided that pricing per deliverable was a difficult way to manage this contract.

2.  Are security clearances required for this contract?

This is a subject that is always changing at TSA because of the changing processes with the Department of Defense. We will not require a secret or top secret clearance, but all personnel will need to have a favorable adjudicated background check before the period of performance begins. 

3.  Regarding past performance references, is it required that 3 references are provided for each company, including team members or subcontractors, or 3 references total?

We ask for a minimum of three (3) past performance references total, but you may provide as many as you would like for each team member or subcontractor.  Please ensure you are providing enough applicable information. If bidders receive a negative past performance reference, the offeror will be given the chance to rebut.

4.  In regard to the staffing requirements of the team lead, can this person be a CSP or CIH?  

Either one is acceptable, but it is emphasized that the team lead must meet all qualifications that are imposed by the qualifying board.

5.  In regard to 15% of work being performed by a small business as a team member or subcontractor, what standards are to be followed to ensure a business falls under the particular small business standard?

If an offeror plans to use/or is a small business, use of 15% or more work by a small business under this contract will be considered an evaluation strength.  To ensure the business is considered small, offerers will need to check the small business standards listed under the particular NAICS code.

6.  Are there contractor personnel in place at the Mission Support Centers now?

Yes there are.  TSA currently has 5 mission support centers (MSCs) located in Philadelphia; Atlanta; Irving, TX; Troy, MI; and San Bruno, CA.  Two are GSA leased space and the other three are leased through a contractor.  

7.  Are all positions for the OSH support service filled by this contract?

Yes.

8.  Will TSA be supplying facility space or is the contractor responsible for providing space for its personnel?

TSA has limited space available at the MSCs (2 spaces). The contractor may propose utilization of these provided spaces or may propose using its own spaces in support of the requirement.  TSA will provide laptops and VPN capability to field personnel.  The majority of this contract is travel based; therefore little time will be spent in an office or fixed facility.  The contractor would have the ability to use those workstations and rotate staff throughout.

9.  Are Representations and Certifications required for subcontractors/ team members as well as the prime?

No, Reps and Certs need only be provided for the prime under privity of contract.  But, remember that we have required the use of ORCA; therefore you can ask subcontractors and team members to use ORCA as well.  The DUNS for the all parties would be required in order to validate the information.

10.  Information Given:

There is no TSA supervision over contractor personnel located at the MSCs.  contents or an alphabetized list of RFP words or subjects, but including these in the technical proposal will be left to the discretion of the offeror.  If the offeror believes the use of these techniques will provide a more clear and concise proposal and demonstrates the type of work product produced by the offeror, then it would be beneficial.  

Cross-indexed means both that the offeror is encouraged to insert cross-references of related proposal paragraphs into the text and include a matrix of proposal responses relevant to RFP requirements.  Again this is not required and therefore it should be included as a enhancement in your technical volume to be included in the page limitation.

6.	RFP section L.2-2 requires bidders to submit a draft Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan. Is this a plan for Government surveillance of the contractor’s work (as specified in FAR 46.4), or is this a plan for contractor surveillance of its own work? If neither, what is it? How does the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan relate to and differ from the Performance Evaluation Plan described in RFP section H.2?

The required Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is a plan for the offeror to provide the Government their specific procedures of how the contractor will conduct surveillance of its own work.  The QASP is different than the Performance Evaluation Plan (PEP) in that the PEP will detail how the contractor shall be evaluated to earn the award fee.

7.	RFP section I, in the subsection that incorporates TSAAMS 1.13-5, Contractor Quality Control, says that the contractor’s Quality Control Plan must “detail how survey administration will be tracked and maintained.” Does this refer to the industrial hygiene survey reports referenced in section 2.2.1.2(x) of the Statement of Work, to the customer satisfaction surveys referenced in section 2.2.4.1 in the Statement of Work, or to some other surveys? Please specify.

The Contractor Quality Control Plan is for the overall administration of the entire contract.

8.	Section L.2 refers to the Resumes of Key Personnel, Sample Final Report, Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan, Quality Assurance Control Plan, Award Fee Plan, and Mitigation Plan as “attachments.” Does this mean that they must be grouped together at the end of the document, after the sections that fall in the 30-page limit? Or must they be assembled in the numbered sequence specified in Section L.2, interspersed among the sections that fall in the 30-page limit?

All attachments that are excluded from the 30 page limitation should be grouped together at the end of the technical volume after the section that fall within the 30 page limit.

9.	Reference Page 11 of 76, Paragraph 2.2.2 Staffing. GS-018 which is cited at this location in the RFP “requires as a minimum 4 year degree in OSH and 3 years experience, 1 year of which was equivalent to at least GS-4, in scientific or technical work that provided and understanding of the basic principles and concepts of the safety and health field.  Creditable general experience must have demonstrated the achievement of knowledge equivalent to the education described above.”  Will TSA accept a GS-5 level person?  What is the acceptable criteria for OSH Specialists on this contract?  GS-5, 7, 9, 11, 12 or above? 

Section C Paragraph 2.2.2 Staffing of the RFP shall hereby be amended to state:
OSH Specialists assigned to the OSH support services contract must fit the description set forth in 29 CFR 1960.2(s).  That is, OSH Specialists must meet POM standards for Safety and Occupational Health Manager, GS-0018.

The minimum acceptable criteria for OSH Specialist working under a Team Lead would be those listed in OPM Publication T-55(8/81) for a GS 0018-09.  Note the SOW used GS-0018 as an example of occupations listed under 29 CFR 1960.s(s).  A GS-690 Industrial Hygienist may also serve as an OSH Specialist, provided the minimum acceptable criteria are similar to those identified for a GS-0018-09.

10.	Reference Page 15 of 76, Paragraph 3.1 Government Furnished Resources/Facilities, Supplies, and Services and Page 41 of 76, Paragraph 3.10.3-11 Contractor's Maintenance Program: Ref. "Contractor will be responsible for maintaining TSA owned equipment issued for Contractor use, including calibration when necessary," and Clause 3.10.3-11: Please confirm the costs associated with maintenance and calibration of Government Owned Equipment will be covered in the ODC Line Item?

No, the costs associated with maintenance and calibration of Government Owned Equipment will be covered in the basic fixed-price CLIN that encompasses all requirements under the SOW.  It will be required of the Contractor to provide the Government with an annual certification of calibrations for all applicable equipment. Please refer to question 18.

11.	Reference Page 24 of 76, Paragraph G.2 Payment Schedule: What are the "required documentation" that must be provided with the Contractor's invoices?

The required documentation to be included in the invoice is listed within TSAAMS clause 3.3.1-17 Prompt Payment (January 2003).  The Contractor will also be required to submit any documentation in support of ODCs and travel, such as receipts in concurrence with the Federal Travel Regulations.  

12.	Reference Page 25 of 76, Paragraph G.4 Preparation of invoices, G.5 Prompt Payment, and page 76 of 76, Paragraph M.6 TSA Clauses, 3.3.1-30 Progress Payments Not Included: Please identify how the Contractor is to invoice on a monthly basis for this FFP contract; e.g., for labor a fixed amount per month based on total Labor divided by 12 months, plus incurred ODCs and Travel at cost?

Yes, it is envisioned that for labor, the invoicing will be 1/12th the annual price PROVIDED the contract has fully staffed the requirement as solicited for performance to begin October 2, 2006.  Travel and any approved ODCs will be billed for the prior month. Please refer to question 70.

Please note the correction that the Period of Performance for this contract will begin on October 2, 2006.  Therefore, please replace the POP starting date of October 1, 2006 with the corrected POP starting date of October 2, 2006 throughout the RFP.

13.	Can I assume the NAICS Code for this procurement is 541690, size limit of $6.5M?

That is correct. However, please see question 1.

14.	Section L.1 Proposal Preparation Instructions – General (page 56 of 76) – items b and d conflict regarding the number of copies.  Do you require an original hard copy plus three copies, or an original plus four copies?

Please provide one original hard copy plus three copies.  Therefore Section L.1 item d shall hereby be amended to state:

d.	Copy number one of the proposal shall contain the signed original of all documents requiring signature by the Offeror.  Use of reproductions of signed originals is authorized for the remaining three copies of the proposal.  


15.	Section L.3.d, Management and Staffing Approach Mitigation Plan (page 58 of 76) – “Offerors shall submit a mitigation plan, as defined in Section K of the RFP.”  The reference to mitigation in Section K is limited to discussion of disqualification of the offer.  Is this correct or should the definition reference be Section L.8 TSA Clauses 3.1.7-4 Organizational Conflicts of Interest Provision-Short Form (page 66 of 76)?

The mitigation plan should be submitted as defined in both Section K.4 3.1.7.5 DISCLOSURE OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (FEBRUARY 2003) and section L.8 3.1.7-4 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST PROVISION-SHORT FORM (FEBRUARY 2003).  The CO will determine if a mitigation plan is acceptable for any identified OCI’s.

16.	Section L.5 of the solicitation indicates that presenters at the orals must be the key personnel who will perform the work.  Section 2.2.2 notes that the Program Manager and Team Leads (7 personnel) are key staff members.  May we assume that TSA only requires a representative number of the key personnel at orals?

No, TSA requires all key personnel to be present at the orals.  Please note the clarification that Key Staff Members is the same as Key Personnel.

17.	Section L.8, TSA Clauses – Clause 3.2.2.5-1 Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items (page 62 of 76) references the SF 1449.  Is there a Standard Form 1449 available for this solicitation?

No, there is not a SF1449 available for this solicitation.  This form will be included in the award document.

18.	In Attachment 3 TSA provided a GFE list.  Will TSA purchase additional equipment, if required, or will the contractor be required to purchase additional equipment?  Will additional equipment be purchased under the ODC CLIN 004 in Section B cost schedule?  For example, will TSA purchase video recorders?

Additional equipment can be purchased under CLIN 0004: Other Direct Costs, if deemed necessary by TSA. Calibration of new equipment will be purchased under CLIN 0004: ODCs.  Insurance for all equipment including the Government Furnished Equipment shall be provided by the contractor.

19.	Will laboratory analyses cost be incurred under this contract?  Will laboratory costs be purchased under the OCS CLIN 004 in Section B cost schedule?

TSA currently has a separate contract for laboratory analysis. TSA will however, authorize laboratory costs under CLIN 0004: Other Direct Costs, if deemed necessary.

20.	Please clarify the format of the response under Technical Section 2.0 - Quality Assurance and Control Plan.  Should this be a brief summary of the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) and Quality Assurance Control Plan (QACP) with references to the separate attachments for the Draft QASP and Draft QACP?

No summary is necessary.  Offerors shall only submit a draft QASP and QACP as an attachment to the technical volume.  As stated, these are excluded from page limitation but shall not exceed 5 pages.

21.	Is the 20 page limit for a sample report inclusive of all title pages, table of contents, appendices etc.

Yes.

22.	We assume that the title page and TOC of the technical proposal do not count against the 30-page limit, is that correct?

That is correct. However, please also refer to question 5.

23.	Number of copies - Par. L.1.b states that an original, 3 copies and an electronic copy are required.  Par. L.1.d refers to copy number one which shall contain all signed original documents, and that reproductions of signed originals are authorized for the 4 remaining copies.  Would you please clarify this requirement?

Please refer to question 14.  
 
24.	Number of past performance references - Par. 6 states that "past performance information should include at least three specific contract references for both the Offeror and any teaming partners." Does this require us to submit at least 3 references for Prime Contractor and also at least 3 references for all teaming partners, or do you want at least 3 in total?

We ask for a minimum of three (3) past performance references total, but you may provide as many as you would like for each team member or subcontractor.     Please ensure you are providing enough applicable information. 

25.	Estimating Travel Expenses and Other Direct Costs.  Section M.3 (Evaluation Factors, under 10.a. Price Proposal) states that evaluation criteria will include, “Travel cost estimates regardless of the travel ceiling provided.”  Section H.23 Contractor Justification for Other Direct Costs (ODCs) states, “The Contractor shall include a detailed description of all proposed ODCs in the contract proposal.  Section H specifies ODCs to exclude travel.”  Section B (Schedule of Pricing) provides not-to-exceed figures for ODCs and Travel.  Are we to use the Section B. figures, as given, for ODCs and Travel totals in our price proposal, or are we to develop our own estimates for ODCs and Travel?  If we are to develop our own estimates, will TSA provide additional information to assist us in developing our estimates to ensure comparability of price proposals (e.g., number of trips per year to specific destinations, lengths of trips, classes of ODCs, levels of activity in classes of ODCs, etc.)?  For those factors that are unknown, can TSA provide a basis for estimating pricing (e.g., number of mishaps to be investigated per year and where, number of industrial hygiene samples to be taken per year and where, copies of training materials to be provided per year, etc.)? Additionally, will TSA expand on the statement in Section H.23, “The Contractor shall utilize Government supply sources when available, including the mandatory-for-consideration DHS commodity contracts as directed by the COTR.” What are the contract numbers for these contracts? What types of commodities are provided through these contracts? How will we purchase commodities from them, as contractors?

Section B numbers as Not to Exceed shall govern for award.  TSA requires the offeror to propose anticipated travel and ODC (name, cost, and justification) costs within the pricing proposal which will be evaluated to determine if fair and reasonable and substantiate the contractor’s clear understanding of the requirements to include complexity and scope as related to the offerors technical approach.  Section H.23 is a standard statement in procurements but is not applicable to this contract at this time. Please refer to question 18 and 19.

Section M.10 Price Proposal is hereby amended to state (bullet 4):
•	Travel and ODC cost estimates regardless of the ceilings provided.

Please note the clarification that all option year’s ODCs and travel CLINs will be escalated by 5% annually.  Section B.1 Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) is hereby amended as such:

Note:
In the event additional organizations are added to the TSA, TSA reserves the right to add the organization to this contract via a surge CLIN. The surge requirement for additional TSA organizations, such as incorporating the Federal Air Marshall organization into this contract, shall be negotiated between the parties for inclusion via modification. It shall be the sole discretion of the TSA to determine if a surge requirement exists. 


26.	Radiation Safety.  The statement of work is silent on radiological safety. Does TSA consider that ongoing ionizing radiation exposure monitoring is within the scope of this contract or does TSA have other contracts in place for this monitoring?

TSA will be contracting separately for radiation monitoring.

<DESC>Amendment 05 to RFP HSTS03-06-R-CAO092 hereby modifies the Past Performance Questionnaire in the following manner.  

 

Instructions

 

Next to each of the questions you will find the following choices:

 

Outstanding            Exceeded performance requirements of the contract, on schedule, with little or no Government assistance

 

Satisfactory / Good                Met performance requirements of the contract with little Government assistance

 

Marginal / Acceptable           Met performance requirements of the contract but needed significant Government supervision and assistance

 

Unsatisfactory / Unacceptable          Failed to meet minimum performance requirements of the contract.

 

Not Applicable       Offeror was not required to perform in this area on this contract.

 

When providing the Past Performance Questionnaire to references, please include these instructions with the document.  All Questionnaires received, regardless of whether they reflect these changes or include these instructions, will still be accepted and evaluated.

  Please refer to question 62.

64.	Does the Program Manager have to be located at TSA Headquarters in Arlington, VA?  If not, how often will he/she be required to travel?

Please refer to question 42.  It will be up to the discretion of the offeror whether the Program Manager will need to travel.

It is hereby clarified that local routine travel (within a 25 mile radius of the TSA Headquarters and TSA Field Organizations) is not reimbursable.

65.	Section 2.2.2 Staffing states that “one team lead will be based at each of the five (5) Field Support Center offices and one based at TSA Headquarters.”  Please better define the term “based.”  Will the team leads have to report to these offices daily, or will they only have to report to these offices on a less frequent basis?  If so, what percentage of time will the team leads be out of the office vs. in the office?  Will the team leads have to live in the cities where the Field Support Centers are based if significant travel is required?

Please refer to Section C Paragraph 3.1 Facilities, Supplies, and Services.  Office space will be provided at the Mission Support Centers and may be utilized as necessary.  The necessary use or the requirement to report to these offices daily will be up to the discretion of the contractor.  Please refer to question 25, 52, and Amendment 01.

66.	The Key Personnel are identified as the Program Manager and 6 certified OSH Specialists/Team Leads.  The technical proposal can contain up to 10 resumes.  What 3 resume beyond the 7 key people does the TSA want to see in the proposal?

As stated, the technical proposal can contain up to 10 resumes and therefore the 3 resumes beyond the 6 key personnel do not need to be utilized.  It is up to the discretion of the offeror whether they would like to submit resumes for the other staff members to enhance the technical proposal.

67.	Please clarify whether the Draft Project Plan is a required component of the Technical Proposal.  The Work Products/Outcomes Summary Table on page 13 of the Solicitation specifies that a draft of this document is due "with proposal", it is not specified in the list of required elements of the Technical Proposal in section L.2 (page 57).  If a Draft Project Plan is a required component of the Technical Proposal, please specify if it will be included in the overall 30-page limitation, or any other page limitations.

The Draft Project Plan is required in the technical proposal as part of the Management and Staffing Plan (See Section L.2 Number 3b) and will be included in the overall 30-page limitation.

68.	Section L.3.d of the Solicitation specifies that a "mitigation plan, as defined in Section K of the RFP" must be included in the Technical Proposal.  However, no mention of this plan is included in Section K.  Please clarify where the definition for this plan can be found.

Please refer to question 15.

69.	Section M.3.10 of the Solicitation states that one of the evaluation factors of the Price Proposal will be "travel costs estimates".  As travel costs have been pre-determined as NTE values in Section B, please clarify how these can be an evaluation factor. 

Please refer to question 25.

70.	How should the base year be costed, given that the winning contractor does not have to fill the non-key positions for up to 60 days?  Should the costing assume all 30 personnel will be on staff for the full year?

Yes, costing shall assume all 30 personnel will be on staff for the full period of performance.  All positions shall be fully staffed on October 2, 2006.  Please refer to question 12.

71.	Are the NTE values for ODCs and travel realistic (contract ceilings), or are they estimates used to normalize the bids?  Why weren’t the NTE values escalated?

The Not to Exceed values for ODCs and Travel are realistic and escalation had not been factored into the ceiling.  Please refer to question 25.

72.	The TSA is requesting that proposals be submitted 1 week after clarifications are posted.  Will an extension be considered?

An extension for receipt of proposals will not be considered.  Proposal shall be due June 22, 2006 at 2:00 pm EST.

73.	Section C. 2. Project Background and Objective: Is the contractor going to be given sufficient training on the SIS and SPP, or is it assumed that the contractor will have current knowledge of the TSA’s SIS SPP? 

The Contractor will be given sufficient training on the SIS, but no training will be necessary or is required for the SPP program. Please refer to question 38.

74.	Section C. 2.2.2.: Can the Government please clarify weather the staffing listed are all Full Time?

Please refer to question 62 and 63.

75.	Section C. 5.4.2. Travel and Per Diem: Only audit approved General and Administrative (G&A) Overhead Rates may be applied to travel. Should this be Indirect Rates many be applied to travel? Are we to assume that not Fee can be applied to travel and per diem?

Only G&A is authorized.  Please delete the verbiage Overhead Rates from Section C 5.4.2.

76.	Section H. 3.8.2-17 (g): There are no key personnel listed. Is this an error? 

Please refer to the Section C Paragraph 2.2.2 Staffing of the RFP where it states what TSA envisions as Key Staff Members.  Please refer to question 16.

77.	Section L. 3.: 10 Resumes at referenced as the maximum. Does the government view that there are 10 key personnel on this contract? 

Please refer to question 62 and 76.

78.	Section L. 4.: In regards to transition of incumbent personnel, can the government identify the number of incumbent personnel, their roles and responsibilities, and their locations? 

Please refer to question 2 and 40.

79.	General: Can the government clarify 

Yes, the Government can clarify any issues offerors may have.  Please refer to question 58.
Please note the above question is as is submitted.

<DESC>This hereby constitutes issuance of Amendment 03 to RFP HSTS03-06-R-CAO092.  


27.	SF 1449.  Section L (Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors, under L.9 (3.2.2.5-1) Instructions to Offerors—Commercial Items) states that, “Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation.” The solicitation does not appear to have been issued with this cover sheet. Will TSA provide a SF 1449 for the solicitation?

Please refer to question 17.  

28.	Currency of Past Performance for Small Business.  Section L (Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors, under L.2 (6.) Past Performance) states that the past performance should have been performed during the past three years. Can this requirement be extended to five years for Small Businesses, given that SBs often do not perform the volume of project work of larger firms?

No, the requirement for past performance can not be extended to five years for Small Businesses.

29.	Proposal Page Limit.  Section L (Proposal Preparation Instructions) states that the Offeror’s technical proposal will contain eight sections and will be limited to 30 pages.  The instructions exclude five sections from the 30-page limit (i.e., Quality Assurance and Control Plan—10 pages, Resumes—20 pages, Mitigation Plan—2 pages, Sample Final Report—20 pages, and Draft Award Fee Plan—15 pages).  Are the cover page, cover letter, table of contents excluded from this page limitation?

Please refer to question 22. 

30.	Font Size for Proposal.  Section L (Proposal Preparation Instructions) states that the proposal will be submitted “with a font size no smaller than 12 points.”  Does this font size apply to tables, charts, graphics, and images too?

Please refer to question 4.

31.	Program Manager vs. Project Manager.  Section C (Statement of Work) defines requirement for the Program Manager position.  Section F (Deliveries or Performance) refers to ‘the contractor’s designated Project Manager” (e.g., Clause G.1, Page 23 of 76).  Are the Program Manager and Project Manager one in the same?

The title Program Manager, as stated in the SOW, and the contractor’s designated Project Manager, as stated in Section F, are interchangeable.  As stated at Industry Day, TSA would like to reiterate that this is a program and not a project.

32.	Since the AMS encourages use of the GSA Federal Supply Schedules, will the TSA entertain proposal of GSA Professional Engineering Schedule or MOBIS fixed unit rate pricing in lieu of a firm fixed price contract?  

This requirement has been solicited as a full and open competition and therefore TSA will not be utilizing any GSA schedule to award the contract.

33.	There is some ambiguity in the RFP in that Section H2 states that the award fee performance plan shall be unilaterally developed by the Government, yet a draft performance evaluation plan needs to be submitted with the proposal (Section M, Paragraph 9)?  Please clarify.

The statements in this question are not correct.  Section H2 of the RFP states that a Performance Evaluation Plan shall be unilaterally established by the Government.  Section M, Paragraph 9 of the RFP states that the offeror shall provide a Draft Award Fee Plan within the technical proposal.  

34.	Will the TSA consider an individual who is a Certified Health Physicist (CHP) as a lead?  In our business (Department of Energy facility operations), our CHPs perform duties similar to CSP and CIH personnel.  

Please refer to the Section C Paragraph 2.2.2 Staffing of the RFP and question 9.  A CHP may be considered provided the individual meets the requirements as outlined.

35.	What does the TSA consider as Other Direct Costs (ODCs)?  

ODCs can include purchase of testing equipment, copying and printing, and lab analysis.  Please refer to question 18, 19, and 25.

36.	We typically use our customer’s QA program in lieu of our own so that there is no additional work o Therefore, it is expected that personnel will uphold a professional standard at all times.

11.  Are there individual Safety Action Teams (SATs) located at each airport?  Can you give an estimate of the number of SATs TSA has in place?

There are approximately 130 SATs active across the country.  SATs are an important aspect of the OSHE office functioning as a bridge between the workforce and leadership. Some SATs are dynamic and integrated while some exist in name only.  SATs are critical to the success of the OSH program. The contractor must be able to provide leadership, regardless of how much hand holding the individual offices need.

On the other hand, management support in the field is easy to find.  The security of our aviation program is pretty well in place and therefore it is time for the field management to examine safety and other employee issues.  In this aspect management has been very responsive.  

12.  Last year a contract was awarded for safety ergonomics, what is the relationship between that contract and this one?  

The contract that was awarded was for job hazard analysis, which included an aspect of ergonomics, but was not specifically focused on safety ergonomics.  As stated in the presentation, that contract provides support to visit each airport once to perform a hazard inspection and analysis and establish a baseline.   A repeat hazard analysis would only be necessary if the operations were significantly changed.

13.  Information Given:

An attachment in Section J describes the different categories of airports and the requirements of each category.

Originally mandated by Congress to see if using Federal screeners or private screeners are better, the current SPP program allows airports to opt out and use private contractors that have been vetted by TSA. Airports submit proposals on how they would provide better security screeners for approval by TSA.  Currently there are six airports that participate in the SPP program.  Also, some of the smaller airports have not been federalized yet; meaning they do not have TSA screeners or may only operate on a seasonal basis.  Because of the options for airports, the number of airports listed on the given attachment is an estimate and may change over the life of this contract.  

14.  Does this contract cover the privatized airports?

No, we provide oversight but TSA does not control the workforce, therefore we are not responsible for implementing or managing their programs. They are responsible for managing the program themselves.  This contract provides support on OSH issues related to space occupied by the FSD and the FSD staff.

15.  Are the airports broken down by regions or sizes?

The airports are distributed among three regions; East, Central and Western. Airports are also classified by category, as listed in the provided attachment.  Note:  In the past TSA hubs and spokes crossed state boundaries, but they have been reorganized to follow state and regional lines.

16.  Are TSA’s regions the same as FAA’s?

No, FAA uses different distinctions.  TSA previously had 5 airport regions but has recently been reorganized to 3 areas.  
	
17.  Information Given:

OMB initiative has found that only about 58 airports are creating 80% of the injury claims reported by DOL.  Categories III and IVs have their own unique problems, but the large Category X airports are the focus at this point in time.  New technology that is initiated in the larger airports is usually pushed out into the smaller airports with time.  Smaller airports don’t have the needed technology and therefore many of the Transportation Security Officers are physically handling baggage.  Technology doesn’t necessarily solve all safety issues though, because any bag that causes an alarm still is required to be picked up and inspected.  Also we need to emphasize the importance of face to face training when possible since there are some things that just aren’t learned through online training.

<DESC>This hereby constitutes issuance of Amendment 04 to RFP HSTS03-06-R-CAO092.  


54.	Under what conditions can a contractor change key personnel between submission of the technical proposal and the orals? 

TSA does not have any authority to stop the change of key personnel between the time of proposal submission and oral presentations.  Any changes to proposed resumes must be submitted as a formal clarification to the proposal, no later than one (1) week prior to the offerors scheduled oral presentation.  All new resumes will be evaluated based on Section M.3 Management and Staffing Approach.

55.	Section M.3, 10 - Price Proposal indicates that Travel cost estimates will be evaluated, however the instructions do not provide any information regarding the travel estimates required or the level of travel anticipated.  Please clarify.

Please refer to question 25.

56.	It appears that the transition period will be the first month of the base year.  Should pricing detail be provided for the transition period, separate from the remaining 11 months of the base period, including an estimate of transition travel?

No. Please refer to question 12.

57.	If tab dividers are used to separate proposal attachments, do the tab sheets count toward the individual attachment not to exceed page limit?  

No.
58.	The RFP  (Section L.6, page 61) lists the cut-off date for questions as June 13.  However, the FedBizOps announcement lists the cutoff date as June 14.  Will the TSA entertain additional questions on June 14?

No, both the RFP and the synopsis on FedBizOps states that the cut-off date for questions is June 13, 2006 and all answers will be posted on June 14, 2006.  TSA will not entertain questions after June 13, 2006. 

59.	The government-furnished equipment listed in Attachment 3 of the Solicitation does not include all items commonly-used for employee exposure assessment activities.  For example, items notably absent in that attachment include noise dosimeters and personal air sampling pumps and apparatus.  Can it be assumed that if devices other than those listed in Attachment 3 become necessary to support the objectives of any resulting contract, that such items (or of any other items of equipment  that become necessary) would either be provided by the TSA or would be reimbursed at suitably burdened costs (above the submitted fixed price total)?

Please refer to question 18, 19, and 25.

60.	If any laboratory analytical services become necessary to support the resulting contract, can it be assumed that any costs for these services would either be borne directly by the TSA, or be reimbursed at suitably burdened costs (above the submitted fixed price total)?

Please refer to question 19.

61.	What "milestones" and "timelines" should be addressed in the Draft Project Plan, which is a required component of the technical proposal?

TSA is requiring the offerors to use their professional judgment in establishing milestones and timelines based on requirements in the Statement of Work. 

62.	Please clarify Section C, subsection 5.2 of the solicitation.  Beyond the one Certified OSH Specialist Team Lead (specified in 2.2.2 of that same section), are there any other contractor employees "required to work at TSA Headquarters located in Arlington, VA"?  Also, is it expected that this will involve full-time, dedicated assignments at this location, including the labor costs associated with such assignments?

Please refer to the Section C Paragraph 2.2.2 Staffing of the RFP, specifically the recommended minimum acceptable staffing requirements listed.

63.	Will the Program Manager position be a full-time, dedicated position for this contract?  Are all the other staff required for this contract (6 certified OSH Specialists/Team Leads, 22 OSH Specialists, 1 QA/Technical Writer) also fully dedicated to this contract?

It is envisioned that the Program Manager and all staff will be fully dedicated to this contract.

All offerors shall acknowledge receipt and acceptance of said amendments in their proposal to include Amendment 01 issued May 30, 2006 via FedBizOpps.  The following are questions and answers submitted by interested parties.  There were 79 questions submitted in total.  Amendment 02 will include Questions 1 – 26, Amendment 03 will include Questions 27 -53, and Amendment 04 will include Questions 54 - 79.



1.	Search as I have, I have not been able to find the exact NAICS code referred to on page 52 and 62 in the RFP. On page 62 it mentions we will see the Code # on the SF1449 which I could not find in our package. Could you please help me with either the SF1449 or at a minimum the NAICS code that the RFP references?

The NAICS code associated with this requirement is 541690 -- Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. The purpose of the NAICS code is for the small business subcontracting goals as addressed in Section M.  There is no SF1449.

2.	At the Industry Day, I posed the question of whether or not the incumbent has the positions filled at the positions filled at the Mobile Support Centers.  In answer to my question, I may have misunderstood, but I thought Mr. Grubbs stated that no positions were filled as of yet and the only staff in place was the TSA staff.  However, in the minutes of this discussion, as show below, the answer to my question is still unclear.  Would you please clarify whether or not the incumbent has all the positions listed in the SOW filled at the Mobile Support Centers?

“6. Are there contractor personnel in place at the Mission Support Centers now?

Yes there are.  TSA currently has 5 mission support centers (MSCs) located in Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, Detroit and San Francisco.  Two are GSA leased space and the other three are leased through a contractor.” 

At this time, the incumbent does utilize the Mission Support Centers (MSC), located in the above Metropolitan areas, for their personnel as contracted.  The positions listed in the SOW for this RFP are different than the position requirements for the incumbent.

3.	As understood, a hazards analysis has been conducted of TSA’s screening operations and working environments under a separate contract. With input from this hazards analysis, or prior to, has a comprehensive safety and health manual been developed and, if so, is it now in place at all TSA locations and Mobile Support Centers?

An OSH Manual is currently in development.  We expect updates will be required under the new contract.

4.	Reference RFP Section L.1, b. Proposals shall be submitted on single sided, 8 ½” x 11” paper, with a font size no smaller than 12 points. May the offeror submit graphics on 11x17 foldout pages? May a font size of 10 points be used in graphics or text tables?

No, all documentation or graphics must be submitted on single sided, 8 ½” x 11” paper.  All font size inclusive of text tables, headers and footers, and text used with graphics must be no smaller than 12 points. 

5.	Reference RFP Section L.1, g. To aid in the evaluations, proposals shall be clearly and concisely written as well as neat, indexed (cross-indexed as appropriate) and logically assembled in the sequence specified in Section L2 of this RFP.  By indexed, does the Government require a table of contents to the fourth level or alternatively, an alphabetized list of RFP words or subjects giving the page or pages on which each item is mentioned? By cross-indexed, does the Government mean that the offeror should insert cross-references of related proposal paragraphs into the text or alternatively, a matrix of proposal responses relevant to RFP requirements? Where should the offeror place the index in the proposal volume sequence? Will the index page count be excluded from the page limitations due to the size of indexing requirements?

The Government does not require a table ofn the customer to review and approve our program.  However, we have used our program when the customer has requested.  Is there a TSA QA program that may wish to be invoked instead?

There is not a TSA QA program; therefore Offerors shall provide a Quality Assurance Plan to be used for the life of the contract.

37.	What is the regional responsibility breakdown vice the new “three region” concept?  i.e. what airports are the responsibility of each region?

Please refer to the List of TSA Field Organizations provided as Attachment 1 of Section J.  This list includes the TSA regional areas.

38.	Who are the companies that lead the Hazard Analysis, SIS and SPP contracts?  How is interaction with these companies to be managed?

There is currently one Hazard Analysis contractor, one SIS contractor, and numerous SPP contractors.  The names of these companies are irrelevant to this procurement.  Interaction will only occur for use of the SIS and this interaction will be managed by the COTR.

39.	How will the Key Personnel and OSH Specialists complete a favorable background investigation before they are on contract, what is the process that TSA intends to use?  Will TSA conduct the background checks for Key Personnel once the contract is awarded or will the Awardee be responsible? 

Upon award, the COTR will provide the necessary information to the selected contractor to allow for the completion of security paperwork.  All personnel will complete and submit paperwork through TSA’s electronic means (http://www.opm.gov/e-qip/) and TSA will conduct the full background investigation.

40.	How many Safety Professionals are currently supporting each of the five Field support centers, how many are CSPs and CIHs?

As stated during the Industry Day Briefing, the current contract is significantly different that this procurement. Please refer to question 2.

41.	Who from TSA will receive resumes and evaluate the experience of new hires?  How long will this process take before prospective hires will be approved by TSA?  What are the specific criteria to be used for approval so that only approvable personnel will be presented?

Please refer to the Section C Paragraph 2.2.2 Staffing of the RFP.

42.	Will the Program Manager be a TSA-site position since there are only 4 workstations at HQ?

TSA does not envision the need for the Program Manager to be on-site at TSA HQ.

43.	What is the level of travel (%) that TSA anticipates for the Team Leaders and OSH Specialists located at the TSA Field support centers?

Please refer to question 25.

44.	Will there be any available space at airport locations from which OSH Specialist may work?

Due to security issues, no arrangements have been made for space at this time.

45.	Does TSA have a current list of all documents at both HQ and in the field that have been generated during the initiation of its OSH program?

Documentation will be made available to the awardee as necessary after all Non-Disclosure Agreements have been signed and provided to TSA.

46.	For transition purposes, how will TSA ensure that its OSH documentation is available to a new OSH support contractor?  Will the data be available to the new contractor after the award date to help with a smooth transition of work?

Please refer to question 45.

47.	Does TSA currently have a master calendar of all required events at HQ and in the field to help ensure a smooth transition of activities?

No.  Both a project plan and transition plan shall be provided as part of the offeror’s proposal.

48.	What are the current performance measures that OMB is using to measure the TSA OSH program?

The TSA OBM initiative is focused on reducing injury rates.

49.	Will the Performance Evaluation Plan noted in H.2 be based on the Draft Award Fee Plan submitted with the proposal?

The Performance Evaluation Plan will be unilaterally developed taking into consideration the negotiated Award Fee Plan provided by the contractor.

50.	Can the font for tables and matrices be less that 12 point as long as it is still legible?

Please refer to question 4.

51.	Can client specific information be redacted from the sample plan that will be submitted with the proposal?

Yes, provided that the Sample Final Report can still be clearly interpreted.

52.	Does new personnel have to live within the geographic area they support? 

No, personnel does not have to live within the geographic area they support provided it is cost effective for that staff member to travel to the area he/she will support.

53.	After award, under what conditions can a contractor replace the key personnel proposed as the Program Manager and Team Leads? 

Please refer to TSAAMS Clause 3.8.2-17 Key Personnel (April 2006) found in Section H.26.

<DESC>Amendment as follows:  All other postings are hereby deleted and replaced with the following:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. Provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-12 are incorporated. 

The National Institute Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Campus located within the Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina, has a need for the removal of approximately 78 hardwood trees located in the medians of the North and South parking lots.

OBJECTIVE:

The objective is to eliminate the obstruction of the security surveillance system by removing the trees and restore the areas, while ensuring minimal disruption of the availability of parking and entrance to the campus facility during normal business hours.  

Q&A (government response) 

Question:	Can the chips be scattered into a woodland area and spread neatly to a depth of 2-3 inches on site?

Government Response: No - The tree debris will be removed from the site by the Contractor who will be responsible for all loading, transportation, and disposal costs.

Question:	When do you anticipate award of this job? 
Government Response: Before Sept 30, 2006

Question:	Because of the extremely dry conditions at the site currently, can the contractor hydroseed and apply a wheat straw cover to the turf areas to restore the grass to eliminate the need for additional watering if he guaranteed an acceptable stand of grass? 

Government Response:  Yes - The government consider this an acceptable approach.  The grass seed should be a blend of fescue without Kentucky 31 fescue variety. The term sod repairs mean area restoration or re-establishment.  All area restoration or re-establishment repairs should be to normal landscape standards.  The government does not expect rolled sod to be installed.    

Question:	The sod probably would require intensive watering for weeks to establish under the current conditions, if sodding is the only alternative, is the contractor responsible for watering the sod until it is established or just the initial watering? 

Government Response: See previous response.  Rolled Sodding is not the only alternative or acceptable approach. 

Question:	Will the government supply a source for the water at no cost to the contractor?

Government Response: Yes - Upon request and with coordination by the Project Officer.

Question:	Does the government require this work to be performed under the direct supervision of a certified arborist?

Government Response: NO

Question:	Will the government provide a temporary staging area for this project?

Government Response: NO

Question:	Could the government provide a copy of the sign in sheet for the site visit scheduled today? 

Government Response: Upon written request

Question:	Will the government have the underground utilities marked before any stump grinding is attempted?

Government Response: Yes

RFP TRN-06-060 
Questions and Responses

QUESTION 1.)	The solicitation states, "contractor will be responsible for any vendor conveyance demurrage after free time."  What if USAID already has 30,000 metric tons on the warehouse floor and railcars/trucks are sent to the warehouse?

ANSWER:  The contract terms limit the number of metric tons that USAID may position at the warehouse to 30,000 metric tons.  The warehouse contractor does not have a contractual responsibility to store more than the tonnage agreed to in the contract.

QUESTION 2.)	Does it make any difference where the warehouse is located?  Does it have to be at a port?

ANSWER:  The government is seeking a food aid commodity warehouse contractor which will enhance the government's Title II food aid program through cost efficient and effective delivery, storage, and re-delivery of our pre-positioned commodities.  The government will award a contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal will be most advantageous to the government.  The government will carefully consider warehouse locations and locally available infrastructure and transport resources.   The government will evaluate warehouse facility proposals consistent with efficient supply chain management.  The entire cost of transporting food commodities from origin to overseas destinations will be evaluated under each proposal.

QUESTION 3.)	The solicitation states, "contractor will be responsible for all clearances to re-deliver commodities to outbound conveyances or vessels."  Is this understood to mean from warehouse to F.a.s. vessel at the port of shipment, or onward?

ANSWER:  The warehouse contract terms require the contractor re-deliver food aid commodities on an Origin or  Free Alongside Vessel, Port of Shipment basis.  There are no contract terms which require the warehouse contractor to re-deliver commodities beyond a F.a.s. Vessel, Port of Shipment basis.

QUESTION 4.)	The solicitation states, "cargoes moving directly from railcars or trucks to the performing vessel or containers are considered F.a.s. vessel."  What about cargo re-delivered from the warehouse to container, is that also considered F.a.s. vessel?

ANSWER:  The solicitation statement has application to warehouse locations at an approved port or in an approved port terminal, and the performing vessel is calling at the warehouse port. Cargoes re-delivered from the warehouse floor to containers are considered F.a.s. vessel when the warehouse floor is considered to be a F.a.s. vessel position, and the performing vessel is calling that port.  You may refer to USDA Form KC 362 for a list of approved F.a.s vessel port locations.  For warehouses not located at an approved port, or for circumstances where a performing vessel is not calling on the warehouse port, this solicitation statement does not have any application. 

QUESTION 5.)	What about under special circumstances, say cargo was delivered and received on the warehouse floor but, for whatever reason, the cargo is re-routed to another Port, not the closest port, for loading onto a vessel.  Would the cargo be considered re-delivered on a F.a.s. vessel basis if the commodities are delivered from the contractor?s warehouse floor to a conveyance (rail or truck) to be drayed to the other port?

ANSWER:  The answer depends on who is draying (and paying for) the transport of conveyances from the warehouse to the alternate port.  Based upon the above scenario, commodities would be considered re-delivered on an origin basis by the warehouse contractor when the railcars or trailers are delivered to an alternate port by the vessel owner or ocean carrier.  Commodities are considered re-delivered on an F.a.s. vessel basis by the warehouse contractor when the railcars or trailers are delivered to an alternate port (F.a.s. vessel) by the warehouse contractor in accordance with their proposed F.a.s. rates in the contract schedule.

QUESTION 6.)	Could you provide a clarification regarding the term "re-delivery?"  When the contract states re-delivery is it understood to mean origin or F.a.s. vessel at the local Port of Shipment?  Or, does USAID also means that if a designated vessel will be at a "Port of Shipment," other than the local port closest to the warehouse, will the warehouse contractor be responsible for transportation to "a different Port of Shipment" other than the closest port?

ANSWER:  The warehouse contractor may propose F.a.s. vessel re-delivery rates for one or more ports of shipment.  In addition to proposing a F.a.s. vessel rate for re-delivery to the closest Port of Shipment, the warehouse contractor may propose alternate F.a.s. Vessel rates for alternate ports of shipment in their region.  The government will not ask the warehouse contractor to re-deliver commodities on a F.a.s. Vessel, Port of Shipment basis, except to those ports for which a rate is agreed in the contract schedule.

<DESC>This solicitation is hereby amended to address vendor questions that have been submitted and to provide the answers to those questions.

Question: What is the flow required for the pump? If unknown, it can be deduced from the speed with which the weights are lifted.

Answer: The entire 300000 lbf weight stack can be lifted in approximately 5-6 minutes.  The pump, however, should be controllable via at least two speeds; at best, completely variable.  The lifting ram/cylinder is 18-inches in diameter with an approximate 18-inch stroke for full weight stack lift.  This system does operate at low lifting speed by design.

Question: What grade of hydraulic oil is required?

Answer: The system currently uses Mobil Extra Heavy. The grade shall be extra heavy. It works the best with the existing seal/gland system in use at the rod end.

Also note: The current system operates at approximately 1200 psi.
