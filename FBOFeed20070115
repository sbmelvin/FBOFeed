<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Subcontract Description
116-N &184-N Explosive Demolition:

Washington Closure Hanford (WCH) is seeking qualified subcontractors to provide demolition services to the River Corridor Closure. WCH is a prime contractor to the Department of Energy at Richland WA. 

WCH intends to award a minimum of two master agreements for explosive demolition services to support the RCC contract. WCH strongly encourages small businesses to participate and encourages teaming arrangements to meet the qualification criteria. WCH will determine (following review of the prequalification questionnaires) if the RFP will be set- aside for small businesses.

Description of Work:

The 116-N Stack and 184-N Powerhouse are located within the Hanford Site in the 100-N Area on the south bank of the Columbia River.  Approximately 38 river miles upstream and 32 road miles from the city of Richland, in the southeastern corner of Washington state.

116-N:

The 116-N Exhaust Air Stack (also called the Ventilation Stack) is a reinforced, monolithic, 69.5-m (228-ft) tall concrete structure that discharges ventilation exhaust to the atmosphere.  It stands on an octangular-shaped below-grade base that measures 1.4-m (4.5-ft) in height and 10.2-m (33.5-ft) across.  Top of stack is 61-m (200-ft) above grade.  It is fed by a below-grade air exhaust tunnel that originates in the 117-N Exhaust Air Filter House.

SUBCONTRACTOR shall be responsible for explosive demolition of the above-grade portion of the stack to include mobilization, dust and fragment projectile controls, drilling, falling the stack to a predetermined location, waste handling (excluding demolition rubble), demobilization, and other work necessary to demolish the 116-N in accordance with this contract. The CONTRACTOR will remove demolition rubble.

184-N:
The 184-N consists of 4 attached structures; the 184 N Power House, the 184 NA Power House annex, the 184-NE compressed gas sheds, and the 184 NF chemical injection pump room.

The 184 N Power House is a 34 m by 29 m by 21 m (112 ft by 96 ft by 70 ft) reinforced-concrete and structural steel building with channeled steel siding on the above-grade portions of the facility.  There is a steel stack 21-m (70-ft) in height from the 17-m (56-ft) roof level.  The facility housed a 15,000 kilowatt turbine generator that was driven by reactor generated steam or by a 575,000 Btu/hr boiler contained in the facility or by associated auxiliary equipment, air compressors, and compressed air receivers.  Chemicals used for water quality control were stored in the facility, and contamination of the facility occurred from pump/equipment leaks.  There is an adjacent facility approximately 15-m (50-ft) to the west.

The 184 NA Power House annex is a 418.5 m2 (4,500 ft2) metal on metal frame building that housed two boilers serving as backups to the main boiler in the 184 N Facility.  The structure shares a common wall with the 184 N Building on the west side.  The boiler steam drums and piping received radioactive contamination from recirculated reactor secondary system water.  East of the 184-NA is an associated steel stack that extends from grade to a height of approximately 24-m (80-ft).  There is an adjacent active power line approximately 13-m (40-ft) east of the stack.

The 184-NE compressed gas sheds consist of two small sheds each approximately 7-m2 (75-ft2) used to store compressed gas cylinders.  Gas piping ran from the gas cylinders inside the sheds into the 184-N Power House.  The sheds share a common wall with the 184 N Power House and are located on the south side of 184-N.  

The 184 NF chemical injection pump is within an approximately 9-m2 (96-ft2) pre engineered, single story steel frame building with metal siding and roofing.  The facility housed the aqueous ammonia injection system that injected ammonia for water quality into the 109 N Facility?s secondary water system.  

SUBCONTRACTOR shall be responsible for building implosion, felling the stacks, fracturing concrete foundations and pedestals, and large component size reduction of the 184-N, to include mobilization, dust and fragment projectile controls, drilling, waste handling (excluding demolition rubble), demobilization, and other work necessary to implode the 184-N, fell the stacks, size reduce specified components, and fracture heavy concrete material into no larger than 0.9m (3ft) in dimension in accordance with this contract. The CONTRACTOR will remove demolition rubble.
:::
Construction drawings for 116-N and 184-N will be provided as part of the subcontract documents.  The primary pay item within the Subcontract will be lump sum. The subcontractor will be expected to provide a full-time on-site site superintendent, a full-time on-site health and safety/IH representative, and a project manager.  The subcontractor will also be expected to have engineering resources available.
