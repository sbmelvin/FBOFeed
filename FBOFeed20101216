<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for assistance and technical services to aid inenterprise geographic information system (GIS) planning and implementation to support theSERVIR project in its ongoing efforts to build a web-based geospatial platform.NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Spatial Development International(SpatialDev).  Competition is impractical for the following reasons:1. The funds specifically dedicated to establish and expand the SERVIR system wereprovided to NASA from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)under a Participating Agency Program Agreement. The requirements and timeframe which havebeen levied on NASA by USAID necessitate immediate implementation; thus, the need to useexisting system familiarity and expertise is virtually unavoidable. Furthermore, doing solessens the risk of failure to implement requirements per the guidelines set by USAID,which incidentally keeps NASA in good standing with the USAID and promotes futurecollaboration. SpatialDev has previously provided technical support to the SERVIRproject, is familiar with the SERVIR platform, and has the required knowledge readilyavailable to support the existing work plans and critical tasks identified for fiscalyear 2011.	2. SpatialDev has an existing relationship with SERVIRs international partner, theRegional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD), which hosts andoperates the SERVIR system in East Africa. This existing relationship will helpfacilitate the continued co-development and implementation of spatial datainfrastructure, and it also presents a successful model of interaction that can be easilyreplicated to SERVIRs other existing and future regional nodes.3. SpatialDev has ready experience in developing technologies for stakeholders indeveloping world contexts. SpatialDevs staff has been intimately involved in needsanalysis and requirements specification for agriculture applications in sub-SaharanAfrica and South Asia, designing data management and dissemination systems in response toregional needs and specifications, and establishing data/service hosting environments.They also have specialized knowledge in combining open source and proprietary geospatialand content management technologies, and their deployment in a range of operationalenvironments.4. SpatialDev is the only contractor that can meet the current requirements of SERVIR inthe near term time frame.  Not only do they possess the relationships and experiencenecessary for working with SERVIRs regional nodes, they have unique access to knowledgeof developments to date to satisfy requirements of SERVIR. Working with a group otherthan SpatialDev would involve a significant loss in previously gained experience andeffort.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon December 30, 2010.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) #M11PS00017 for Proposed Research on Safety of Oil and Gas Operations in the US Outer Continental Shelf
DESCRIPTION:
The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEMRE) solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the BOEMRE Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program on Safety of Oil and Gas Operations in the US Outer Continental Shelf.  When appropriate, the research shall be conducted consistently with prior research.  For a summary of TA&R research recently performed, visit http://www.BOEMRE.gov/tarsafety/index.htm. Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting white papers.
BACKGROUND:   
The BOEMRE TA&R Program is requesting white papers to be submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement. Selected white papers will be requested to submit proposals.  Proposals selected for funding by BOEMRE shall receive funding from FY 2011. The BOEMRE anticipates that $7,000,000 may be available for the initiation of new research addressing topics identified through this announcement.  BOEMRE anticipates awards resultant to this announcement will be made on a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) basis. 
OBJECTIVES: 
The topics for the FY 2011 safety research funding should be limited to the following topics: 
1. Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) Intervention and Capabilities
Determine the capability of the current fleet of deepwater ROVs available for subsea wild well combatant and intervention operations when rig-activated or emergency blow out preventers (BOPs) shut-in procedures fail. Provide recommendations on the capabilities needed for ROVs to successfully operate BOP functions during a well control scenario.    
2. Deepwater Wild Well Control Technology 
Assess current technology and limitations of equipment and procedures for deepwater well-loss control, and provide recommendations where current technology can be modified and/or simplified to improve the safety and effectiveness of deepwater operations. Evaluate the assurance of fail-safe systems and redundant safety control features and investigate and report on alternatives (technology, equipment, procedures, etc.) to regain control of a wild well should all other well control systems fail. 
3. Effect of Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) in High Pressure (HP) High Temperature (HT) Wells on Tubulars and Cement. 
Establish how commonly used tubular and cement properties are affected by exposure to H2S and/or CO2 in HP/HT wells.  Determine the capability of these materials to function properly in these environments, and provide suggestions to ensure long term integrity of the well. 
4.  Blow Out Preventer (BOP) Maintenance and Inspection for Deepwater Operations 
Review the maintenance and inspection of subsea BOPs to determine the optimum testing for functionality, the maintenance of BOP structural components such as flange bolts, and the maintenance and inspection of BOP mobilization and re-use from one job to the next.
5.  Detecting Subsea, Leaking, Abandoned Wells 
Determine the existence and extent of the leakage occurring from Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) temporarily and permanently plugged and abandoned subsea wells.  The study should determine if there is a leak problem, what are the potential causes and how the BOEMRE regulations (subpart Q) can be revised to prevent the leakage.
6. Use of Mechanical Bridge Plugs for Increased Well Abandonment Security 
Investigate the benefits of using mechanical bridge plugs in temporary and permanent well abandonment procedures, considering potential failures of cement plugs.
7.  Analysis of Current Cementing Procedures 
Assess current cementing procedures to identify best practices and areas of concern. The study should provide recommendations of how to improve the technology and methods used in cementing operations, as well as present suggestions for areas where additional research is needed. Recommendations and conclusions should be based of sound science and engineering, and historical and statistical data.
8.  Production Verification Enhancement 
Establish guidelines for overall uncertainty limits for new and existing hydrocarbon production measurement technologies.  Develop procedures which can be used in the field or in the office to ensure that metering facilities operate within these tolerances. 
9.  Timeframe for Flushing and Filling Out-of-Service Pipelines Based on Service
Determine the acceptable time frame in which an out-of-service pipeline should be flushed and filled with inhibited sea water based on its service; product type and chemistry. This study shall provide a risk based analysis and guidelines to ensure effective integrity management.
HOW TO RESPOND: 
White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORIGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format, on a CD, shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4817, ATTN: Ms. Joanne Murphy.

<CONTACT>Rosanne S Wilson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-4433, Fax 301-443-0501, Email wilsonr@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Aging (NIA), intends to negotiate, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, on a noncompetitive, sole source basis, with the Regents of the University of Michigan, DRDA for the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) Biorepository requirement.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources may express their<br />interest by submitting a capability statement or proposal. All capability statement/proposals received within fifteen<br />days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the<br />Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the<br />discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of<br />determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This effort will be one base year with four option years (12 months for each performance year).</p>
<p>The SWAN Biorepository is in accordance with the authority 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>The Regents of the University of Michigan has continued to support the SWAN Biorepository activities related to receiving, storing, cataloging, preserving and distributing specimens to qualified investigators. The Contractor used a grant mechanism to design the repository and has assiduously provided services for the SWAN study over the past ten (10) years. The Contractor is the sole proprietor of the specific version of the inventory management system developed for and used by the SWAN repository; therefore, there is limited access to the data management system itself. The Contractor shall obtain services from SeraCare Life Sciences since the frozen biospecimens are housed in sixty-five (65) 80&#8304;C mechanical freezers at SeraCare. There are 1.7 million irreplaceable and highly perishable biological specimens (whole blood, serum, plasma, urine, extracted DNA, buccal cells, immortalized cells) contained in these freezers. To relocate the large repository from SeraCare's location can pose high risks by damaging the viability of cells and progress made over the last ten years of the SWAN study. The Regents of the University of Michigan has the unique capability to provide these required services to NIA for the SWAN BioRepository. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project makes competition unfeasible for this study. The objectives of the requirement are detailed below.<br /><br />Background and Purpose of the SWAN Biorepository:</p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) continues to have a need for collecting, storing, monitoring and distributing blood, urine and DNA samples for the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). The SWAN Biorepository has been supported since 2000 by a NIH research project grant mechanism (to the University of Michigan) which is separate from the SWAN clinical field sites, coordinating center and central laboratory. This requirement shifts the SWAN award mechanism from a grant to a contract.</p>
<p>SWAN is an ongoing multi-ethnic longitudinal study conducted by seven (7) clinical field sites, a data coordinating center and a central laboratory. It is designed to characterize the physiological and psychosocial changes that occur during menopause and beyond. SWAN has an extensive base of well characterized data and a repository of biological specimens from 3,300 African American, Chinese, Caucasian, Japanese and Hispanic women with over twelve years of annual follow-up visits that describe the endocrinology of the menopause transition and other factors relevant to midlife health and aging. The women, who ranged in age from 42 to 52 years at enrollment in 1996-97, will continue to be followed until they are 59-69 years old under an existing grant mechanism which expires in 2014 (and is separate from this repository requirement). SWAN has the capability to link the expansive biological, medical, social, behavioral, and demographic data it has collected over seventeen years to the development of both positive and deleterious health conditions, disorders and diseases in early old age. The major thematic areas of SWAN include 1) Physical Functioning; 2) Bone/Osteoporosis; 3) Cognitive Function/ Symptoms/ Mental Health; 4) Diabetes/Cardiovascular disease; 5) Physical functional performance and 6) Osteoarthritis,</p>
<p>The SWAN repository samples were meticulously collected and managed from 3,302 women from five race/ethnic groups followed annually prior to, during and after the menopausal transition. The SWAN Biorepository is an integral arm of SWAN intended to support and facilitate (the collection, processing and storage of new specimens from the ongoing study) and extend the SWAN core study to allow the efficient evaluation of new and untested existing hypotheses. The repository specimens consist of 578,000 serum, plasma and urine samples, one million urine samples from the Daily Hormone Study (an annual study of hormone patterns across a full menstrual cycle nested within the parent study) and 26,300 DNA samples (including 7,928 vials of immortalized cells from more than 1,500 participants). SWAN will continue participant follow-up visits and longitudinal data collection between 2010 and 2014. As a result, it is anticipated that an additional 113,792 new serum, plasma and urine samples will be generated for in the SWAN repository.</p>
<p>The SWAN Biorepository is a component of the SWAN Study. The purpose of the SWAN Biorepository is to provide a resource designed to receive, store, catalog, preserve and distribute specimens to qualified investigators. The SWAN Biorepository is needed to 1) support collection and storage of biological specimens from planned follow-up visits in the ongoing SWAN study; 2) provide for the continued management of the current biorepository specimens; 3) provide for continued administration of the review process for requests for specimens and management of specimen distribution; and 4) develop strategies to promote utilization of specimens. The contract shall provide and implement Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures for prospective evaluation of short and long term specimen management, including identification and removal of non-useful specimens as well as refinement of specimen cataloging.</p>
<p>This proposed acquisition was previously publicized under sources sought notices HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-<br />SBSS-10-131 and HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RDSS-10-131.</p>
<p>The estimated contract award date will be on or about June 30, 2011.</p>

<DESC>Bandelier National Monument, Los Alamos NM, a unit of the National Park Service, has a need for a Cultural Landscape Report for the Bandelier Civilian Conservation Corp Historic District. The district was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1987 under the "Architecture in the Parks" theme study. This project consists of a contract for historical research, physical investigations, analysis, and development of design criteria and treatment recommendations that will lead to completion of a Cultural Landscape Report (CLR), Parts One and Two.  Part One provides landscape history, description of existing conditions, and analysis of significance, landscape characteristics, and integrity.  Part Two provides design criteria and general and specific, short- and long-term landscape treatment recommendations. While a number of historic themes relate to the district area and Frijoles Canyon in which it is primarily located, this CLR will focus on the theme of New Deal Era, CCC-construction of visitor and operations facilities which is also the focus of the NHL nomination.   The overall goal of the CLR and its implementation is to preserve and/or enhance the high degree of historic integrity within the study area while maintaining a safe and functional environment for employees and visitors.
Solicitation for the Cultural Landscape Report project to be posted on or about January 6, 2011.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought
<p>Requirement</p>
<p>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Grants, NM, that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 10,350 contiguous rentable square feet of office/warehouse/wareyard space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 9,000 contiguous ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (ABOAF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years, 5 years firm. The space must be available for occupancy by December 1, 2011. The delineated area is within the city limits of Grants, NM.</p>
<p>Other applicable requirements include:</p>
<p>- 28 structured surface parking spaces are required<br />- Building must be Energy Star certified</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Please send expressions of interest to</p>
<p>Jones Lang LaSalle Americas, Inc.<br />Contact: Ryan Simpson<br />Address: 1225 17th Street, Suite 1900 <br />Denver, CO 80202 <br />(303) 260-6537<br />Ryan.simpson@am.jll.com</p>

<p>- Building name and address and location of the available space within the building;<br />- Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced;<br />- ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (ABOAF) to be offered and expected rental rate per ABOAF, fully serviced. Indicate whether or not quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvement and state the amount, if any;<br />- Date of space availability;<br />- Method of rentable space measurement;<br />- Building ownership information;<br />- Amount of parking available on site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rates include the cost of the required Government parking, if any;<br />- Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building; and<br />- List of building services provided.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC/ARSTRAT) seeks information regarding capability, maturity, cost and technical information for the acquisition of microsatellites (Microsats) and related support services. Although no formal solicitation exists at this time, SMDC/ARSTRAT is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to gain awareness and capabilities of available vendors that can meet SMDC/ARSTRAT's microsatellite and support services requirements for future acquisition.<BR><BR>The request for information encompasses the following requirements: <BR><BR>Microsatellite: SMDC/ARSTRAT seeks to attain information regarding development of microsatellites that possess flexibility in its design to serve as "motherships" or "deployer" satellites to host and/or deploy assigned payloads from SMDC/ARSTRAT and its customers. SMDC/ARSTRAT requires microsatellites with a minimum Technology Readiness Level of 8 to 9 for all spaceflight hardware with a design capable to achieve class C-D. At a minimum, microsatellites require: total microsatellite weight of 160-180kg; payload capacity of 40-60 kg with volumes of 100,000-120,000 cm3; thermal: <10oC to 65oC; orbital power service >= 100W; payload power services =< 30W; peak power draws < 200W; power service battery charge 8-10 amp hour; and primary voltage of 28V to subsystems and payloads. SMDC/ARSTRAT prefers to gain technical details related to structure and mechanical subsystems; electrical power subsystem; command and data handling subsystem; guidance, navigation, and control subsystem; and spacecraft design capable to sustain mission operations at orbit altitude between 500 and 700km.                                                                                                                        <BR>Support Services: SMDC/ARSTRAT seeks information on supporting the microsatellite to include deployment (payload integration, launch support exclusive of actual launch, and on orbital asset management), system responsibility, and the liability associated with accomplishing all support services. This planning, conducting, and reporting the below three tasks:<BR> 1) Satellite Development and Integration:  requires the vendor to develop, integrate assigned payloads from multiple Government sources, test the integrated microsatellite and payload configuration, and microsat and component technology development assessments;<BR> 2) Launch:  requires the vendor coordinate payload and launch vehicle systems integration with launch provider(s) to include accomplishing all required certifications as required by launch provider(s); <BR>3) On-orbit Operational Support:  requires the vendor to plan and continuously control deployed satellites on-orbit over an extended period of time (multiple years per microsat) with industry, DoD agencies, NASA, academia, and others. <BR><BR>Interested offerors must submit a brief but complete Capabilities Statement that demonstrates the company's capabilities to perform these requirements NLT 17 January 2011. Evidence shall be submitted that demonstrates the company's ability to perform satellite development, flight preparation and support, launch services (exclusive of actual launch), satellite and payload delivery, and on orbit maintenance through past experience to include duration of the task, maturity of satellite and support services, and commercial insurance to include liability accepted for Satellite, Integration, and resultant orbit maintenance.  <BR> Relationships between the company and any university, non profit, or Government agencies that may provide assistance should be documented.  It is anticipated that any resultant effort will NOT AUTHORIZE foreign national particiption to include non U.S. citizens.<BR><BR>This is a request for information only and your response shall not constitute an offer. This request for information does not commit the Government to pay for any costs incurred to prepare your submission. All responses shall be submitted to Ms. Rebecca Williams via electronic mail to Rebecca.Williams@smdc.army.mil, no later than close of business, 1700 hrs, CST 17 January 2011.

The pigs are necessary because the research being conducted requires a pig of a manageable size and weight, and only the Gottingen pigs satisfy this need. In addition, the research requires that the animals have a controlled microbiological background, low inbreeding, and known background data (hematology, clinical chemistry, physiology, pharmacology, and toxicology). For consistency of results, good quality science, and to avoid un-necessary experimental repetition, it is imperative that we continue to use the same strain of minipigs that we have studied for the past two years.<br /><br />This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses must be submitted electronically, via email, to Pierre.Smith.CTR@usuhs.mil by 5:00 PM (EST) on December 23, 2010. The first delivery is scheduled for December 21, 2010.<br />

<DESC>FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:Stanley Chan, Electronics Engineer, (732) 532-1862 <BR><BR>This is a market survey to locate additional sources for the depot-level repair service for the components of the Lightweight High-Gain X-Band Antenna (LHGXA) and Large Aperture Multi-Band Deployable Antenna (LAMDA).  The LHGXA is a X-Band antenna that has a sixteen-foot reflector and serves as a Quick Deployment Satellite antenna for Ground Mobile Forces terminals.  The LAMDA is a variant of the LHGXA that provides C, X, and Ku Band communication capabilities.  The LHGXA and LAMDA are complex assemblies designed to work with high power radio frequency energy within a tactical environment.  Both antennas are built on a trailer configuration, and can be towed by a HMMWV or a five ton truck, or transported by air or rail.  The following components of the LHGXA/LAMDA are the candidates for depot-level repair: NSN 5975-01-437-3993, Junction Box (LHGXA); NSN 5985-01-556-3220, Antenna Subassembly (X-Band Feed Assembly); NSN 5985-01-556-7125, Antenna Subassembly (C Band Feed Assembly); NSN 5985-01-556-4216, Antenna Subassembly (Feed Component Assembly X-Band); NSN 5985-01-556-4224, Antenna Subassembly (KU-Band Feed Assembly); NSN 5975-01-556-7324, Junction Box (LAMDA); NSN 5985-01-556-7121, Reflector, Antenna; NSN 5985-01-556-7134, Waveguide Assembly; NSN 5985-01-556-7137, Waveguide Assembly. The current source for depot-level repair of these components is Harris Corporation, CAGE Code 66948.  Technical data package such as engineering drawings, acceptance test procedures, and repair documentation, which are all required to establish depot repair capability, are NOT AVAILABLE from the Army.  Suppliers capable of providing this service must so indicate in writing to: Commander, U.S. ARMY CECOM LCMC, ATTN: RDER-PRC-MC (Stanley Chan), Building 1202 3W, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5023.  Response via electronic media using Microsoft Office 2000 products (i.e., Microsoft Word and Excel), and Adobe Acrobat (Portable Document Format) is acceptable and preferable.  The response MUST include documentation such as test results, depot maintenance repair procedures for the mentioned components, and copy of purchasing order if the supplier was a vendor to the listed source or a statement from listed source demonstrating that the supplier can, in fact, successfully provide this service.  Successful supplier will be required to warrant that the items supplied will satisfactorily perform when used for the purpose intended by the Department of Defense and be delivered on time.  Technical questions shall be sent to the above address or through email to Stanley Chan, email: Stanley.U.Chan@us.army.mil.  The deadline for response to this notice is January 05, 2011. <BR><BR>stanley.u.chan@us.army.mil<BR>CECOM LCMC POC<BR>

<DESC>FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:Mr. Edward Aleszczyk, Electronics Engineer, (732) 532-9320 FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS<BR><BR>This market survey notice is a sources sought for information ONLY, to be used for preliminary planning purposes.  NO proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals and NO contract shall be awarded from this survey.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.  This is a Market Survey for a contract for depot and field level overhaul and repair (O&R) services, field maintenance support, and engineering services for the AN/USC-28(V) Satellite Communications Set (SCS), and Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) Electronics Counter-Countermeasures Control Subsystem (DECS) Central Component (CC)/DECS Remote Component (RC). In addition this acquisition will also continue to provide resident site support (fault isolation, corrective action, engineering support and testing) through Field Maintenance Technicians (FMTs) for the subject equipments. The FMTs will support site personnel which are required to maintain fielded systems worldwide. The Contractor's Systems Engineering Staff will provide analytical support to the FMTs on-site problems and duplicate and suggest corrective action for system anomalies reported by the FMTs. In addition all Depot maintenance, repair, rebuild, overhaul and redeployment required to correct said anomalies will be accomplished. The Government did not acquire a Level III drawing package which would be used for in-depth troubleshooting and engineering analysis of system problems and anomalies, furthermore the proprietary nature of much of the technical data precludes that availability of such drawings (i.e., a complete technical data package) necessary to provide the detailed Depot level and site engineering support for the systems for which this contract is intended. A respondent must be able to prove to the Government how Depot level and field problems can be identified and corrected without the aid of detailed design drawings. A written response must include evidence of the respondent's ability to support the described equipment by writing to Commander, USACECOM, ATTN: AMSRD-RDER-PRA-ED (Aleszczyk), Building 1202, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5000. For more information contact Mr. Edward Aleszczyk, (732) 532-9320.

<p>Description:</p>
<p>The Department of Education (ED) is planning to release a Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about February 10, 2011 to continue the operation and maintenance of the Migrant Student Information System (MSIX). The purpose of this announcement is to request information from potential offerors as to alternative approaches to Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) of the MSIX. Of particular interest is the potential use of Cloud computing in addressing the requirements of MSIX O&amp;M support. The contractor will provide support services to perform the operations, sustainment, documentation, training, and enhancement of the MSIX. <br /><br />Background:</p>
<p>The Department of Education's (ED) mission, as supported by the implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act, is to ensure equal access to education and to promote educational excellence throughout the nation. Implementation of the Migrant Student Information Exchange (MSIX) is directly relevant to ED's Strategic Plan in Goal 1, Improve Student Achievement, which is the first of three goals that support ED's mission:<br />&nbsp;<br />"The Department of Education's mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access."<br /><br />The Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) Office of Migrant Education (OME) is responsible for administering the Migrant Education Program (MEP). The MEP is authorized under Part C of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended. ED provides grants to States to operate the MEP and provide supplemental educational services for migrant students.<br /><br />OME is mandated in the No Child Left Behind Act in Section 1308(b) to assist the States in developing effective methods for the electronic transfer of student records and in determining the number of migratory children in each State. OME established the Migrant Student Information Exchange (MSIX) project to accomplish this mandate.<br /><br />The MSIX was implemented in September 2007 and currently supports migrant records for 97% of the migrant student population with 41 states having submitted data for inclusion in MSIX.<br /><br />This Performance Work Statement (PWS) is primarily a Fixed Price Performance-Based Acquisition (PBA) with mission-oriented objectives, event-driven performance measures, metrics, incentives and disincentives.</p>
<p>Objective: <br /><br />1. The scope of the draft PWS encompasses Contractor support to provide the System Operations, Customer Support, Help Desk &amp; Trouble Ticket Management, Asset Management, and State Support for the MSIX. In meeting the goals and objectives of the draft PWS, the Department of Education is investigating the feasibility of using "Cloud" computing as an alternative approach to accomplish the following activities currently being addressed by servers and other equipment owned by ED.<br /><br />a. Ensure the MSIX System remains fully functional and stable (e.g. bug-fixes, security upgrades, software patches), and complete all required system, hardware and software upgrades in a timely manner. <br />b. Interface daily with customers and other MSIX personnel to maintain a high quality of support for MSIX. Responsibilities shall include system usage training for the customers, and rapid response to all technical problems reported to the Contractor by the customers or by MSIX staff.<br />c. Be expected to install and maintain all MSIX hardware components and keep track of them via an automated reporting and tracking tool. <br />d. Perform Help Desk Support &amp; Trouble Ticket Management tasks required to meet expected service levels and to support the end users of the MSIX. <br />e. Meet related system security requirements.<br />f. Support MSIX staff training initiatives nationwide.<br />g. Provide Internet redesign and support as required.<br /><br />2. In addition to the discussion of implementation of a Cloud solution to the above standards, a series of questions regarding capability must be answered. <br />a. Company Name, DUNS Number, Company Address, Point of Contact, Telephone Number, e-mail Address, and Size of your Organization (i.e. Large Business, Small Business) as validated via the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), using as the basis for your response.<br />b. Explain core elements of a "Cloud" solution that would address the requirements of the PWS.<br />c. Provide a limited discussion risks associated with cloud computing and methodology for mitigating risks associated with cloud usage in the federal government.<br />d. Is this type of Cloud solution being used by other government (Federal, State or Local) organizations (if so, who)?<br />e. Responses should identify any current or potential future regulatory or security concerns.</p>

<DESC><p>The Norfolk District, Corps of Engineers is contemplating a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for construction projects for the Department of Defense Education Activity to cover Fort Bragg, Camp Lejeune, Pope Air Force Base, and the Marine Corps Air Station-New River in the state of North Carolina. This MATOC will also cover Fort Jackson, and Marine Corps Air Station in South Carolina, as well as Fort Benning, and Fort Stewart, Georgia. A MATOC is an Indefinite Delivery Contract for construction services with multiple awardees. Actual work is awarded through task orders. Multiple awardee's generally compete with each other for task orders. There are some rules, whereby competition may be reduced or task orders are issued non-competitively to one contractor. The Government anticipates award of up to four contracts under the MATOC to experienced sources performing a wide range of Design-Bid-Build and Design-Build construction projects. Each contract under the MATOC will consist of one-year base period plus four option periods. The total maximum amount the Government will order under all four contracts will not exceed $400,000,000.00. The guaranteed minimum amount for the contract is $8,000,000. The task orders awarded under the proposed MATOC are mostly for construction of new schools, but the MATOC will also be used to award task orders for renovations and additions to existing schools. New schools will accommodate grades K-12, and the effort will include demolition of existing facilities and site work. The school facilities shall have paved parking and driveways, masonry or concrete veneers, fencing, bus and parent drop off with entrances and signs, heating ventilation and air-conditioning, energy efficient systems and equipment, landscaping, traffic/street signs, driveways, building and site lighting, recreational areas, play lots with play equipment, and walkways. The school will also include fire protection systems and alarm systems, smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, a public address system, Anti-Terrorism and Force Protection measures, handicapped accessibility, sustainment measures, reduced energy use measures, and underground utilities services. <br />The Government will award each MATOC based on Price and Non-Price evaluation factors. Non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than price. Non-price factors are Past Performance; Past Relevant Experience (D-B-B and D-B); Technical Approach. The NAICS Code is 236220 for work specified in this sources sought, with a small business size standard of $33.5 million. We are requesting that all interested and qualified small business firms respond to this sources sought with a capability statement similar to your marketing package used in everyday business. Please specify your small business type (Hubzone, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), etc.). The Government will utilize the following information in determining acquisition strategy: (1) how your company is uniquely capable and qualified to handle projects of similar scope, and complexity of the above described work; (2) summarize your past performance on projects completed similar to the project outlined above. The list of relevant projects shall include names of company, point of contact, phone and fax, project scope, type of contract and unique characteristics encountered within the execution of the contract; (3) bonding; provide your bonding capacity per contract. Please note that under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 15% of the contract work with his/her own employees. Your capabilities statement must be submitted in written format to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Norfolk, ATTN: Contracting Office, Lynn Tanno, 803 Front Street, Norfolk, VA 23510-1096. The capability statement must be submitted no later than 7-Jan-2011 at 12 noon eastern standard time. Limit briefing package to 10 pages.

<DESC>The Norfolk District, Corps of Engineers is contemplating a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for construction projects for the Department of Defense Education Activity to cover Fort Knox, and Fort Campbell in the state of Kentucky, as well as Fort Rucker, Alabama. A MATOC is an Indefinite Delivery Contract for construction services with multiple awardees. Actual work is awarded through task orders. Multiple awardee's generally compete with each other for task orders. There are some rules, whereby competition may be reduced or task orders are issued non-competitively to one contractor. The Government anticipates award of up to four contracts under the MATOC to experienced sources performing a wide range of Design-Bid-Build and Design-Build construction projects. Each contract under the MATOC will consist of one-year base period plus four option periods. The total maximum amount the Government will order under all four contracts will not exceed $500,000,000.00. The guaranteed minimum amount for the contract is $10,000,000. 00. The task orders awarded under the proposed MATOC are mostly for construction of new schools, but the MATOC will also be used to award task orders for renovations and additions to existing schools. New schools will accommodate grades K-12, and the effort will include demolition of existing facilities and site work. The school facilities shall have paved parking and driveways, masonry or concrete veneers, fencing, bus and parent drop off with entrances and signs, heating ventilation and air-conditioning, energy efficient systems and equipment, landscaping, traffic/street signs, driveways, building and site lighting, recreational areas, play lots with play equipment, and walkways. The school will also include fire protection systems and alarm systems, smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, a public address system, Anti-Terrorism and Force Protection measures, handicapped accessibility, sustainment measures, reduced energy use measures, and underground utilities services. <br />The Government will award each MATOC based on Price and Non-Price evaluation factors. Non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than price. Non-price factors are Past Performance; Past Relevant Experience (D-B-B and D-B); Technical Approach. The NAICS Code is 236220 for work specified in this sources sought, with a small business size standard of $33.5 million. We are requesting that all interested and qualified small business firms respond to this sources sought with a capability statement similar to your marketing package used in everyday business. Please specify your small business type (Hubzone, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), etc.). The Government will utilize the following information in determining acquisition strategy: (1) how your company is uniquely capable and qualified to handle projects of similar scope, and complexity of the above described work; (2) summarize your past performance on projects completed similar to the project outlined above. The list of relevant projects shall include names of company, point of contact, phone and fax, project scope, type of contract and unique characteristics encountered within the execution of the contract; (3) bonding; provide your bonding capacity per contract. Please note that under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 15% of the contract work with his/her own employees. Your capabilities statement must be submitted in written format to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Norfolk, ATTN: Contracting Office, Lynn Tanno, 803 Front Street, Norfolk, VA 23510-1096. The capability statement must be submitted no later than 7-Jan-2011 at 12 noon eastern standard time. Limit briefing package to 10 pages. This sources sought should not be construed in any manner to be an obligation on the US Army Corps of Engineers, Norfolk District part to issue a contract, or result in any claim for reimbursement of costs for any effort you expend responding to this request. No solicitation is currently available. Point of Contact is Lynn M. Tanno, (757)201-7839; email: Lynn.M.Tanno@usace.army.mil; Fax (757)201-7183.

<DESC>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has an ongoing requirement for lease of antenna sites at site-specific locations. ATF has determined that it is in the Government's best interest to award these requirements with a base year and up to four option years. The vendor names, site locations, and estimated costs (for Years 2011-2015) are identified below.
<p>&bull; Kane Site and Storage, Salem, VA; Site: Poore Mountain; Estimated Value $26,100.00<br />&bull; Authority for Educational Television Kentucky dba KET Foundation, Lexington, KY; Site: KET Tower; Estimated Value $32,417.16</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />These contractors retain ownership of the individual towers where ATF's communications equipment is located. These sites were selected based on a survey conducted to determine what sites could meet the needs of ATF's Private Land Mobile (LMR) system which provides administrative and tactical radio communication coverage needs. Criterion includes:<br />1) Provides the maximum transmit capability<br />2) Receives coverage range for clear as well as encrypted transmissions<br />3) Provides minimal interference on receive frequency<br />4) Provides the best level of safety for ATF agents in the field<br />5) Equipment housing facility and height<br />6) Utility support<br />7) Security<br />8) RF noise level/interference<br />9) Site access<br />10) Telco Access <br />11) Cost</p>
<p>In support of ATF's LMR systems' infrastructure needs, communication equipment is installed and housed in various locations throughout the Continental US, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Alaska. The locations include remote, mountainous, rural, and/or metropolitan sites. A yearly site lease is established where ATF communications equipment is housed and renewed annually thereafter as long as there is an existing need for LMR coverage to support ATF operations. THIS IS A PARTIAL SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 531390 with a size standard of $2 million dollars. Any award resulting from this requirement will be issued pursuant to FAR Part12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>

<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than January 4, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>

<ARCHDATE>01062011
<CONTACT>Jonathan Terrell, Email Jonathan.Terrell.ctr@darpa.mil
<DESC>DARPA will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Deep Sea Operations (DSOP) Development program on January 5, 2011 from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM at the System Planning Corporation facility located at 3601 Wilson Boulevard, 5th floor, Arlington, VA 22201 in support of the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) DARPA-BAA-11-24 (expected to be released prior to the conference). The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the DSOP Development program, promote additional discussion on this topic, and address questions from potential proposers. <br />PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION: <br />DARPA anticipates releasing the BAA for the Deep Sea Operations Development program with the objective of developing ASW surveillance capability that operates at the extreme ocean depths to detect quiet submarines overhead. In Spring 2010, DARPA initiated architecture studies for the program. The studies addressed system solutions for configurable technology to achieve ASW surveillance over large, operationally relevant, deep ocean areas. Broad guidance served as a framework for performers to develop a wide range of solutions that would:
<p>&bull; Operate with sensors or sources near the ocean bottom, <br />&bull; Exploit the advantages of distributed and unmanned nodes,<br />&bull; Configure to a range of operations, environments, and time scales, and<br />&bull; Adapt to the mobility of the surface assets or evolving threats.</p>
<p>These architecture studies have provided insights that shape this new solicitation for the subsequent phases of the program. Starting with Phase 1b, this task will complete technology assessment and risk reduction, and subsequent Phases 2 and 3 (addressed as options in the BAA) will allow for critical technology and system development.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Participants must register no later than close of business (5:00 PM ET) December 30, 2010 at the following website: http://www.solers.com/BAAinfo-reg/dsop/. Directions to the facility and other materials are also available on the website. There is no registration fee for attending this conference. Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 100 registrants, and no more than 2 representatives per organization.</p>
<p>A SECRET clearance will be required for this meeting. Clearances must be passed by December 30, 2010, using one of the methods below. POC information should be annotated as: DSOP Proposers' Day.</p>
<p>* JPAS (preferred method): SMO Code: 9G4904 <br />* Security POC: Leon Jones, 3601 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA 22201 <br />* Fax: (703) 351-8311 <br />* Security related questions and concerns should be directed to Leon Jones, (703) 516- 8441<br />* Administrative POC: Jonathan Terrell, Jonathan.Terrell.ctr@darpa.mil<br /><br />A confirmation email will be sent to your provided email address upon receipt of clearance.</p>
<p>The Proposers' Day does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to any potentially related Broad Agency Announcements or potential research solicitations on this topic. There is no registration fee for attending this conference. Conference attendance is not required to propose to DARPA-BAA-11-24. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred to participate in this Proposer's Day.</p>

<DESC>The National Science Foundation (NSF) intends to participate as a sponsor for a workshop on Responsible Professional Practices in a Changing Environment with the American Association for Advancement of Science (AAAS) Meeting on a sole source basis. The meeting will be held in Washington, DC on February 17, 2011.
<p>The AAAS is the largest interdisciplinary scientific and engineering society in America, with over 120,000 members worldwide and more than 280 affiliated societies. Each year, the meeting attracts the national and international press. The meeting encompasses virtually all areas of science and technology. AAAS is uniquely positioned because of its stature and reaches within the scientific community to conduct this workshop. As a sponsor, NSF can reach out to a large number of participants at a fraction of the cost of holding its own event.</p>
<p>Under the order, AAAS will organize the one day workshop. The funding will cover the costs of AAAS Staff time and FB, travel and per diem for presenters, resource materials, AV equipment use, meeting space, and signage and supplies.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the government intends to sponsor with only one source under the authority of FAR 12.106. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. This synopsis is for information purposes only.</p>

<DESC>Recovery  Task Orders 1 through 9 under Contract NNG09CP09CThis posting is being provided for information purposes only. NASA Goddard Space FlightCenter has selected Fibertek Inc for the following tasks identified below for the LaserSystems Engineering Services (LSES) contract, NNG09CP09C.  These task orders utilizedAmerican Reinvestment and Recovery Act funds.  The basic contract was a competitivelyawarded as a cost-plus award fee, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract(CPAF/IDIQ) contract.  While the Recovery Act and all associated guidance express a clearpreference for award of fixed price actions, placement of a task under this CPAF contractwas determined appropriate for the proposed work.  CPAF was determined appropriatebecause the contract is for new, state-of-the art development of instruments.	Theproposed work cannot be performed on a fixed price basis due to potential variabilityinherent in the nature of R&D effort.  In addition, a cost-type contract provides theflexibility required to accommodate changes in program requirements which may occurduring performance.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is twofold. First, the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to begin the process for a follow-on competitive contract to the Special Operations Forces Deployable Node-Medium (SDN-Medium) Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) requirement. Technically, the follow-on effort will consist of a Family of Satellite Terminals with a potential contract value of $350M over five years. USSOCOM plans on issuing a Request For Information (RFI) for this type of capability in January 2011. <br />
<p><br />The following milestones are provided for planning purposes to Industry: <br /><br />Market Research - Continuous through RFP release<br />RFI release to industry - Jan 2011 <br />Acq Plan/ Statement of Work/Demonstration Plan- Feb 2011 through Apr 2011<br />RFP release - May 2011<br />Source Selection - Jul 2011 through Sep 2011 <br />Contract award - Nov 2011</p>
<p><br />Second, and solely as a bridge to complete the competitive follow-on effort, it is necessary to increase the current SDN-M contract H92222-06-D-0007 with L-3 Global Communications Solutions of Victor, New York, by $40M. This increase is also needed due to an accelerated pace of contract requirements in response to USSOCOM's operational tempo as it prosecutes the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). Justification for this bridge increase and pursuit of non-competition is that there is no other approved or available contract vehicle for SOF SDN-M systems available. Moreover, it is expected that there would be substantial duplication cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1b. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Dr. Xinhua Liang, NO.14, Section 3, Renmin (S) Rd., Chengdu, China 610041 to provide Professional Services in the Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry Section, Oral and Pharyngeal Cancer Branch, NIDCR.</p>
<p>The protein synthesis initiation factor, eIF5A, is an essential protein required for eukaryotic cell growth.  NIDCR plans to address the function of the two isoforms of eIF5A and its modification enzymes in mammalian development and cancer by a genetic approach in mice.  Although eIF5A-2 has been proposed as an oncogene, it is unknown whether it is required for mouse development.  Initially, NIDCR will examine the role of eIF5A-2 and its modification enzyme in mouse embryonic and neonatal development.  Dr. Liang will conduct the gene knock studies with the gene-targeted ES cells and characterize the phenotypes of gene-targeted mice (heterozygous and homozygous, if viable) to address the function of eIF5A-2 and DOHH (deoxyhypusine hydroxylase) in mammalian development and cancer.</p>
<p>By engaging in this gene-targeted project (and also participating in the transgenic animal study), Dr. Liang will broaden his knowledge on translational regulation on mouse development and tumorigenesis and also in the mouse genetics.  These projects will enhance his expertise in animal tumor biology and genetics.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that Dr. Liang is an Associate Professor in the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery in Sichuan University, China.  As a surgeon in head and neck cancer, he has established an independent research program addressing the molecular mechanism of metastasis and invasion of head and neck cancers.  He is proficient in a broad range of techniques in tumor biology, including cell culture, histochemistry, tumor dissection and animal pathology, animal surgery, molecular biology, and RNAi and microRNA technology.  He is well equipped to conduct the proposed gene knock-out studies and is eager to address the function of eIF5A isoforms and the hypusine modification enzymes in mouse development and tumorigenesis.  He was previously trained in the Mayo Clinic (2006) as a Research Fellow.  Based on his credentials and research interest, he is the best qualified candidate to carry out the research project.</p>
<p>The period of performance is 12 months.</p>
<p>The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), Bethesda, MD.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology, and is not a small business set aside.

<DESC>The Senior A&amp;A Specialist performs the pre-award and post-award Acquisition and Assistance (A&amp;A) functions supporting a large portfolio in strategic areas:  Capacity Building, Democracy and Governance, Economic Growth and Agriculture, Health, CARPE, Peace &amp; Security and Protection.  The portfolio consists primarily of level-of-effort term and completion contracts and cooperative agreements. Specifically, the incumbent will be expected to perform all pre-award functions to include but not limited to participation in portfolio reviews, procurement planning, and the development of possible new activities.  The incumbent will also be expected to perform all post-award actions as well as to foster training and development of that skill to a new A&amp;A Specialist.
<p>I.	DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The incumbent shall provide personal services as a Senior Acquisition and Assistance Specialist for USAID/DRC/Office of Acquisition and Assistance (OAA). The incumbent will be responsible for all pre-award and post-award functions, such as development of requests for proposals/applications, drafting of documents for the contract review board, preparation of award instruments, modifications to acquisition and assistance actions, claims, change orders, post-award approvals and actions, terminations, audits, and closeout.  The incumbent will be assigned a portfolio, and will also be expected to provide on-the-job training to 1 foreign service national (FSN), who has no experience in A&amp;A.  The incumbent must be experienced and be able to independently perform the pre-award functions, such as drafting solicitations and requests for applications, instructing and providing expert guidance to technical evaluation committees, performing cost and price analyses, cost reasonableness analysis, conducting negotiations, and preparing award documents and award file documentation for review and signature of the contracting officer (CO).  The incumbent will be expected to provide training to the FSN acquisition specialist(s) in A&amp;A pre-award and post-award functions.  An estimated breakdown of duties based on DRC's current worked load is as follows:</p>
<p>a.	Pre-Award and Post-Award function for acquisition and assistance    awards (60%)<br />b.	Provide A&amp;A training to USAID/DRC personnel. (20%)<br />c.	Provide advice and guidance to SO teams, prepare documentation for CO signature, comply with internal and external reporting requirements, administrative duties such as maintaining electronic and paper file systems (20%)<br /> <br />Representative Duties:  None required.</p>
<p>Travel:  The A&amp;A Specialist may be needed to travel within DRC to visit field sites and regional USG offices.  Currently, such travel is infrequent.</p>
<p>II.	SUPERVISION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES<br /> <br />Supervision Received:  The incumbent shall report directly to a Contracting Officer.  The incumbent shall work independently with limited supervision.</p>
<p>Supervision Exercised: The incumbent will work closely with one FSN acquisition specialist and be responsible for her on-the-job training.  While the incumbent will not have direct supervisory responsibilities over the FSN, the incumbent will be evaluated not only on the quality of his/her own work products, but on the progress and performance of the FSN under his/her tutelage.</p>
<p>Overall Management Functions: The incumbent will not have the authority to sign A&amp;A instruments, or any other documents, that require a warrant, nor the authority to make legal determinations that have the effect of binding the Government.  If a US citizen, the incumbent may be eligible for a warrant, but this is not guaranteed.</p>

<p>Instructions to Offerors:</p>
<p>FAR Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JUN 2008) is hereby incorporated by reference. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.</p>
<p>Addendum to 52.212-1(b)(4), in addition to proposed pricing, Offerors shall submit a written proposal that addresses technical merit/approach, work management, past performance and staffing in sufficient detail to enable the Government to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This technical capability shall consist of the following information in the solicitation.</p>
<p>1. Technical Merit/Approach</p>
<p>a. A written explanation demonstrating the Offeror's technical understanding and approach to meet the requirements of the SOW effectively will be evaluated. In addition, each Offeror is required to explain the approach it would use in carrying out the required monthly maintenance to include schedule and process.</p>
<p>b. The Offeror shall address the major technical and operational factors of the SOW, a high level assessment of the risks inherent in this type of work, and an explanation of an approach to minimize these risks. An example would be "Does the Offeror have replacement cameras/card readers in stock if either needs to be sent to the shop to be fixed?"</p>
<p>c. The technical merit/approach portion of the written proposal shall not be more than 5 pages in length.</p>
<p>2. Work Management</p>
<p>a. A written explanation demonstrating the Offeror's ability to properly manage and track the preventative maintenance of the secure access system each month. In particular, explain how Offeror will ensure the technician is not conducting preventative maintenance on the same components each month and neglecting other components.</p>
<p>b. The work management portion of the written proposal shall not be more than five pages in length. <br />&emsp;</p>
<p>3. Past Performance</p>
<p>a. The Offeror shall provide recently completed (within the last five years) project summaries, which briefly describe relevant experience. Each project summary should: (1) identify the customer (agency or client), the resources and cost expended, and the period of performance; (2) provide a brief description of the scope of the effort and a brief discussion of its relevance to this work; and (3) identify and discuss the involvement (if any) of the key personnel being proposed for each project summary. In addition, the Offeror shall provide for each project summary the following information:</p>
<p>&bull; Name of Government Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) and Contracting Officer (CO) (or if citing non-Government example, name of customer POC);<br />&bull; Name, address, phone number, and, if applicable, e-mail address of the POC;<br />&bull; Contract Number (and if applicable Task/Delivery Order Number)</p>
<p>b. If the Offeror has no relevant past performance history, it must affirmatively so state. Offerors with no relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably under this factor, in accordance with FAR 15.305. In the case of a relatively new firm (i.e., established within the last 18 months), the Offeror may submit past performance information for contracts on which its corporate management has performed, to supplement any past performance information for the firm itself. This shall be specifically noted in the proposal submission.</p>
<p>c. In responding to this part of the written proposal, Offerors shall limit the response to approximately 2 pages per summary.</p>
<p>4. Staffing</p>
<p>The success of the contract depends heavily on the staffing</p>
<p>a. Each Offeror shall submit, at a minimum, resumes for each actual or potential employee working in the respective key personnel position (i.e., Senior Technician and Program Manager).</p>
<p>b. The staffing portion of the written proposal shall not be more than five pages in length.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a contract without discussions and advises all Offerors to present their best prices in response to the solicitation. The Government reserves the right to open discussions and negotiate a contract. NOTE: All Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to receive an award from the Government.</p>

<p>Evaluation:</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>a. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the lowest price, technically acceptable and responsible Offeror. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical merit/approach, work management, past performance, staffing and price.</p>
<p>Technical merit/approach, work management, past performance, and staffing (all carrying an equal value), when combined, are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>b. Options - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.</p>
<p>c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p><br />U. S. COAST GUARD<br />HU-25 ENGINE AND AUXILIARY POWER UNIT ELECTRONIC CONTROL REPAIR<br />STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES (SOO)</p>
<p>1.0 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The purpose of this Statement Of Objectives (SOO) is to define the tasks to be performed for the repair of HU-25 Engine and Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) Electronic Controls installed in the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Fleet of HU-25 Aircraft. This SOO outlines the tasks and services that will be performed for the USCG by the contractor under this program.</p>
<p>2.0 OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this program is for the proposed contractor to provide all resources required to accomplish the test, repair and modification of the items identified in this SOO within a required delivery turn time Not To Exceed (NTE) 180 days. This includes repair labor, test labor, materials, and other direct/indirect costs.</p>
<p><br />3.0 SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the scope of work identified below on repairable items returned to them exhibiting normal wear and tear that is common to the operating environment and usage of the item.</p>
<p>a) Test Only (No Fault Found) - The component shall be tested prior to repair, utilizing the <br />Acceptance Test Procedure developed for the component by the contractor. If the incoming component passes the acceptance test, it shall be returned to the USCG under the "No Fault Found" Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) of the contract schedule.</p>
<p>b) Repair - Shall consist of troubleshooting, repair, or <br />replacement of circuit card(s), or individual circuit card components such as capacitors, transistors, micro chips, etc. Minor repair of chassis wiring harnesses will also be covered under repair. The Acceptance Test Procedure shall be accomplished to verify proper function of the component following repair.</p>
<p>c) Modification - Any change in the physical form, fit, or functional characteristic of the <br />component or system.</p>
<p>d) Partial Refresh- The contractor agrees to submit a Firm-Fixed Price proposal (FFP) along with supporting information to the USCG Contracting Officer for any item that is a candidate for a "Partial Refresh". The price for this will become a line item of the contract repair schedule. The primary purpose of a "Partial Refresh" is to improve the reliability and repair turn around. If the cost proposal for the partial refresh is acceptable the USCG Contracting Officer may elect to modify this contract. "Partial Refresh" shall be a one-time, major repair to (EEC) PN 2101484-14, and shall be documented by signing off the ACMS code assigned to this task for the serial number EEC affected. Under no circumstances will an EEC be partially refreshed twice without written instructions from the USCG Contracting Officer. The Partial Refresh will consist of replacing Circuit Card Assemblies (CCA) A1, A2, A3, A5, A7, and A13, with new manufacture CCA's. The USCG intends to have 50 each EEC P/N 2101484-14 "partially refreshed" and desires that all 50 be completed within the first 3 years of the contract.<br /><br />4.0 REPAIR CONTROL</p>
<p>The contractor shall be responsible for establishing an internal monitoring system to ensure repairable items are tracked and repaired in a timely manner.</p>
<p>The contractor has a required delivery of 180 calendar days for turn-around-time (TAT). The TAT clock begins after receipt of the repairable item at the contractor's repair facility dock and receipt of the corresponding Delivery Order (DO) by the contractor facility/Point of Contact, the latter of which will start the TAT clock. The contractor is to notify the USCG Contracting Officer immediately upon delivery at their repair facility.</p>
<p>The TAT clock will stop should the following situations arise:</p>
<p>a. Item exceeds "Order Limitations for Maximum Order" as per FAR clause 52.216-19. <br />b. Receipt of items missing subassemblies.<br />c. Items deemed Beyond Economical Repair (BER) or Beyond Physical Repair (BPR) as agreed by both parties.<br />d. Request for Engineering Analysis. (This needs to be discussed/clarified on a one to one basis)<br />e. Awaiting price approval for work to be performed outside the scope as agreed upon by both parties in the final awarded contract.<br />f. Notification by the Contracting Officer to cease work until authorized to continue.<br />g. Awaiting approval for Class I Changes (Class 1 changes are blueprint design changes that affect fit, form, or function.)<br />h. Unusual damage induced by the USCG.<br />i. Foreign Object Damage (FOD).<br />j. Obsolescence Issues. <br />k. Missing corresponding DO authorizing repair.</p>
<p>Should any of these situations occur, the contractor shall immediately advise the USCG Contracting Officer via facsimile (FAX) or E-mail.</p>
<p>Upon resolution of these situations, the TAT clock will commence and the contractor will immediately begin performance of work.</p>
<p>i) The contractor shall promptly notify the USCG Contracting Officer of any condition that could have potential or actual negative impact on the contractor's performance under this multi-year repair program; including, but not limited to: closing or moving of facilities; loss of key personnel; work stoppages/strikes; capacity issues as the result of other customers; and material supply issues.</p>
<p>Storage - Items shall be handled and stored in accordance with "Best Commercial Practices" without any increase in price and in such a manner to prevent damage and/or theft. All material purchased by the USCG for use as Government Furnished Property (GFP) shall be placed in a bonded storage, segregated from other bonded storage material, jointly inventoried by the vendor and a USCG representative at least once each calendar year. All GFP not in inventory must be traceable to use or installation in the USCG end item.</p>
<p>4.1 Items Received in an Abnormal Condition:</p>
<p>a) Should an incoming shipment bear evidence of shipping damage, the contractor shall immediately notify the USCG Contracting Officer via e-mail or fax and await disposition instructions from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>b) If an item is received at the contractor's repair facility in an incomplete condition, a Report of Discrepancy (ROD) in the contractor's format will be filled out and forwarded to the USCG Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>c) If an item is received at the contractor's facility, which is recommended by the contractor to be in a Beyond Economical Repair (BER) or Beyond Physical Repair (BPR) condition as defined below, the USCG Contracting Officer must be notified in writing immediately after the BER/BPR condition is identified. The contractor shall provide a cost breakdown to repair the item, so a fair and reasonable determination can be made by the USCG.</p>
<p>1) Beyond Economical Repair (BER) - An individual repair that will cost more than 75% of a new replacement unit. An item can only be deemed BER through a bilateral agreement between the contractor and the USCG.</p>
<p>2) Beyond Physical Repair (BPR) - An item received for repair that is considered non-reparable. An item can only be deemed BPR through a bilateral agreement between the contractor and the USCG.</p>
<p>d) In the above conditions, no further repair action will be taken and the unit in question is to be put in the bonded storeroom for safe keeping until written authorization to proceed or disposition instructions are received from the USCG Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Upon resolution of these situations, the TAT clock will commence and the contractor will immediately begin performance of work.</p>
<p>The TAT clock ends when the item is delivered to USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC).</p>
<p>The contractor is granted Material Review Board (MRB) authority for this repair program. <br />The contractor is authorized to incorporate Class II changes without authority from the USCG. (Class II changes are minor changes that do not affect fit, form or function.)</p>
<p>4.2 Actions Following Repair</p>
<p>a) Test After Repair - The contractor shall use the Repair Acceptance Test Procedure that was developed to test the item to assure serviceability of the repaired item. The contractor's inspector will witness the test and shall certify the acceptance of the repaired item by entering his or her name and/or stamp and date in appropriate blocks of the repair action document. The contractor shall issue a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 8130-3 Flight Worthiness Document for each repair of Electronic Engine Control (EEC) part number (PN) 2101484-14. The EEC is a flight critical item and is tracked utilizing the USCG Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS). All other engine electronic components on this contract are non flight critical, not ACMS tracked, and may have repairs documented by a Certificate Of Conformance (COC) acceptable to the Government.</p>
<p>b) Identification and Condition Code Tags - Ready-For-Issue (RFI) or Not Ready-For-Issue (NRFI) tags will be completed and attached to the repair item. The same data will be shown on the accompanying packing list. The tag will reflect the P/N of the item after repair and conformance to repair requirements certified by the contractor's quality inspector.</p>
<p>c) Inspection Test Records - The contractor shall keep and maintain proper and adequate inspection, test and related records, including Certificate of Conformance (COC) and repair action document. The Test/Acceptance report for any item repaired under this contract shall be made available to the USCG upon written request from the USCG Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>4.3 Obsolescence Management</p>
<p>USCG acknowledges that some items on this contract may be at risk for obsolescence. The contractor has entered into this contract subject to commercial availability of component parts in the market at reasonable prices to complete orders under this contract.</p>
<p>a) If, during the manufacture or repair process, the contractor becomes aware that required component parts are no longer available, the contractor is authorized to immediately stop work and notify the USCG Contracting Officer of the obsolescence factors.</p>
<p>b) If the USCG determines that the item is still required and so notifies the contractor, they will investigate alternate sources within the industry for compatible replacement parts that meet the contractor's Quality System Requirements and do not modify form, fit, or function of the end item.</p>
<p>c) In some cases, out of manufacture parts may be available on the market from distributors or surplus dealers who have made life time buys at the time of last manufacture. In such cases, distributors and dealers, to account for the risk of holding out of manufacture parts, often escalate prices substantially. The USCG Contracting Officer agrees price impacts due to obsolescence shall be a basis for equitable adjustment of contract price and that the contractor will promptly submit a proposal with supporting information for required contract changes.</p>
<p>d) If a suitable replacement component is not found within a time period mutually agreed upon by the USCG and the contractor, the USCG Contracting Officer agrees to terminate for convenience without penalty that portion of the contract affected by obsolescence.</p>
<p>e) As an alternative to termination for convenience, the contractor will, at the USCG Contracting Officer's request, submit a quotation to perform an obsolescence review of the subject product. Upon approval or agreement of the obsolescence review, the contractor, if directed by the USCG Contracting Officer, shall provide a proposal for the effort required for updating the production in order to fulfill the contract.</p>
<p>f) Upon receipt of a Notice of Obsolescence from the contractor on an item, the USCG Contracting Officer will suspend the delivery date, without penalty, and re-establish a new delivery date by mutual agreement, upon resolution of the obsolescence problem.</p>
<p>5.0 Service Bulletins-</p>
<p>All new service bulletins shall be identified by the contractor to the USCG Contracting Officer. Upon receipt of notification from the Contracting Officer that a service bulletin is required, the contractor will submit an FFP to incorporate the Service Bulletin in all subsequent repairs to the P/N component. This FFP shall be submitted by the contractor to the USCG Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notification. The proposal will contain supporting pricing information. Upon agreement of an FFP, the USCG Contracting Officer will issue a contract modification to incorporate the service bulletin. Service bulletins created and incorporated during performance of this requirement may create new part number configurations, which supersede the previous configuration. When service bulletin incorporation changes the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) part number, the new part number shall be added to the contract. The same procedures apply if removal of service bulletins is required.</p>

<p>52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items. (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>DETAILED FACTORS</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Management/Solution/Approach</p>
<p>The technical/management solution/approach will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Contractor's solutions will achieve Coast Guard objectives of Engine and auxiliary power unit (APU) electronic controls refurbishment (repair). The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the Contractor has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused. Evidence of the quality of the technical management /solution/approach includes:</p>
<p>(a) A comprehensive performance work statement and contract breakdown structure that identifies the services to be implemented to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.</p>
<p>(b) A sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, secure, flexible, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.</p>
<p>(c) A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes. The management approach needs to provide:</p>
<p>&bull; Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing large enterprise-wide managed services under performance based arrangements.<br />&bull; Clear lines of communication between the Contractor's team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.<br />&bull; Active and continuing participation and involvement of senior corporate executives in ensuring the success of this program.</p>
<p>(d) The Contractor's validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance. i.e., ISO 9000 type or other quality certifications, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) required service bulletins, FAA 8130-3 Flight Worthiness Document or COC.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Performance Measures and Metrics</p>
<p>The offered performance metrics and service level agreements will be evaluated for the extent they are:</p>
<p>(a) Comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives.<br />(b) Identifying the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness<br />(c) Tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics.</p>
<p>Factor 3: Past Performance</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will examine how the Contractor's past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction. The Coast Guard may use data obtained from other sources to conduct the past performance assessment, as well as that provided in the quotation.</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will also examine the Contractor's actual performance on repair of similar or like items. This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.</p>
<p>Factor 4: Cost/Price</p>
<p>Each Contractor's cost/price proposal will be evaluated based on the following:</p>
<p>(a) Evaluation of proposed price/cost.</p>
<p>(b) Reasonableness: Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.</p>
<p>(c) Realism: If applicable, a realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, material kinds and quantity for reach identified CLIN/SubCLIN in the contractor's proposed cost/price proposal. The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Contractor's technical proposal.</p>

The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. <br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either (1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or (2) terminate the contract for default. Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute. <br />(i)(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time- <br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and <br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection. <br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances. <br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies. <br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract. <br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor (1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or (2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in paragraph (l)(1) or (l)(2) of this clause and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby. (End of clause)<br />52.247-34 F.O.B. DESTINATION (NOV 1991)</p>
<p>(a) The term "f.o.b. destination," as used in this clause, means-<br />(1) Free of expense to the Government, on board the carrier's conveyance, at a specified delivery point where the consignee's facility (plant, warehouse, store, lot, or other location to which shipment can be made) is located; and <br />(2) Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consignee's wharf (if destination is a port city and supplies are for export), warehouse unloading platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of the Contractor. The Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage, accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or "constructive placement" as defined in carrier tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail carrier is used, supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the consignee. If motor carrier (including "piggyback") is used, supplies shall be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the consignee, except when the supplies delivered meet the requirements of Item 568 of the National Motor Freight Classification for "heavy or bulky freight." When supplies meeting the requirements of the referenced Item 568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if requested. If the contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarded for less than carload shipments, the contractor shall ensure that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to complete delivery to consignee. <br />(b) The Contractor shall- <br />(1)(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or <br />(ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements; <br />(2) Prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading; <br />(3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the contract; <br />(4) Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the contract; <br />(5) Furnish a delivery schedule and designate the mode of delivering carrier; and <br />(6) Pay and bear all charges to the specified point of delivery. <br />(End of clause) <br />52.212-5 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2010) <br />(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: <br />(1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br />___Alternate I (Aug 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br />(2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). <br />(3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Pub.

(End of clause) <br />52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2008) <br />(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees. <br />(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show- <br />(1) The solicitation number; <br />(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers; <br />(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; <br />(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary; <br />(5) Terms of any express warranty; <br />(6) Price and any discount terms; <br />(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address; <br />(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically); <br />(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments; <br />(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and <br />(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. <br />(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days (SEE ATTACH ADDENDA PAGE 48) from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. <br />(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing. <br />(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. <br />(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. <br />(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. <br />(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and- <br />(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or <br />(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or <br />(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. <br />(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. <br />(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. <br />(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. <br />(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. <br />(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br />(h) Multiple awards.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); <br />(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and <br />(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. <br />(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies- <br />(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and <br />(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <br />(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN. <br />(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). <br />o TIN: ________________________________. <br />o TIN has been applied for. <br />o TIN is not required because: <br />o Offeror is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership that does not have income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal paying agent in the United States; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government. <br />(4) Type of organization. <br />o Sole proprietorship; <br />o Partnership; <br />o Corporate entity (not tax-exempt); <br />o Corporate entity (tax-exempt); <br />o Government entity (Federal, State, or local); <br />o Foreign government; <br />o International organization per 26 CFR 1.6049-4; <br />o Other ________________________________. <br />(5) Common parent. <br />o Offeror is not owned or controlled by a common parent; <br />o Name and TIN of common parent: <br />Name ________________________________. <br />TIN _________________________________. <br />(m) Restricted business operations in Sudan.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>The purpose of this SSS/CRFI is (1) to further engage industry in the effort through interactive Industry Days to gather additional information to support on-going market research, (2) to assist the Air Force in developing innovative low risk technical and business approaches to maximize compliance with approved operational requirements while achieving rapid operational fielding at affordable acquisition and ownership costs, and (3) to identify sources that can provide capability that satisfies the government's current requirement to deliver HH-60 Recap capability and CVLSP capability in either a combined package or as separate efforts. As described in the previous CRFIs, the Air Force is planning to acquire up to 112 new helicopter systems to recapitalize its aging HH-60G fleet and up to 93 new helicopter systems to replace the UH-1N fleet.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>Reference previous announcements PIXS6396, originally posted 17 December 2009 and updated 13 December 2010, and PIXS6470, originally posted 23 March 2010 and updated 10 December 2010. The Air Force will conduct Industry Days to discuss the HH-60 Recap and CVLSP programs, as indicated in the 10 December 2010 posting to support the Air Force's on-going market research process. The Air Force seeks to gather information on innovative business approaches that provide the potential for efficiencies by leveraging common aspects between programs announced in the referenced previous market research SSS/CRFI releases. The Air Force also seeks to understand how these approaches are advantageous to the Government regarding the rapid fielding of systems capable of meeting minimum operational requirements at the lowest acquisition and ownership costs.</p>
<p>RESPONSE GUIDANCE:</p>
<p>Industry Days - For the one-on-one session provide an unclassified briefing no longer than 1 hour in length to address the PURPOSE and INTRODUCTION section listed above. There will not be a general session.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL CRFI RESPONSE GUIDANCE:</p>
<p>(1) HH-60 Recap - If you did not respond to the original CRFI, you may do so now under separate cover (not part of the briefing). If you responded previously and have changes to your original submittal, italicize new information and strike through replaced information.</p>
<p>The USAF is interested in determining the level of capability, in accordance with the Recap CDD, that can be initially fielded as an Off-The-Shelf (OTS) production platform. This initial capability would be modified to a full CDD compliant platform after required design, development, testing, and analysis are completed. With this additional information, confirm the level of capability you can provide Off-The-Shelf (OTS) to meet this intent, to include the development schedule to meet the threshold values in accordance with the desired Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY15, if a go-ahead production decision is made in FY12.</p>
<p>(2) CVLSP - If you did not respond to the original CRFI, you may do so now under separate cover (not part of the briefing). If you responded previously and have changes to your original submittal, italicize new information and strike through replaced information.</p>
<p>The minimum CVLSP values provided in the original RFI PIXS6396 are now threshold values. With this additional information, confirm that you can provide an Off-The-Shelf (OTS) capability to meet these threshold values and achieve the desired Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY15, if a go-ahead production decision is made in FY12. In addition to demonstrating an understanding that the threshold values of all CVLSP requirements must be met, please provide the path by which your aircraft will achieve US DoD Live Fire Test &amp; Evaluation and US Military or Civilian Air Worthiness Certification by IOC.</p>
<p>EVENT DETAILS:</p>
<p>Industry participation is limited to prime contractor teams with a maximum of 10 per contractor/team. Time will be set aside for meetings for each company to discuss its aircraft with Government representatives in one-on-one sessions.</p>
<p>Notification is required NO LATER THAN 1400 EST, 30 December 2010, <strong>submitted by e-mail</strong> to Richard Saltsman at richard.saltsman@wpafb.af.mil or Adam Bernas at adam.bernas@wpafb.af.mil. Please provide the program office with the names and titles of no more than 10 individuals who will be attending and include company name, citizenship, address, business size, and cage code (if applicable). Each company will be allotted up to 2 hours for a one-on-one session with the Government team (maximum of 1 hour allowed for company PURPOSE and INTRODUCTION briefing). Briefing times will be scheduled on a first come, first serve basis and will be assigned via e-mail. The government may provide additional information (general acquisition, testing, air worthiness, etc.) to assist in Q&amp;A during the one-on-one sessions. As the info is generated, it will be distributed electronically. Contractors who have specific questions they wish to discuss may submit them in advance to the contacts identified above.</p>
<p>Participation in this Industry Day is voluntary and in no way obligates the Government to award any contracts or pay any costs associated with such participation.</p>
<p>The meeting will take place in Dayton, Ohio on 12-14 January 2011 at the BAE Systems Facility located at 4032 Linden Avenue, Dayton, Ohio, 45431.</p>

<DESC>RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS IS PROVIDED.


QUESTION 1:  3.3.1 states that "closing packets" is within the scope, yet not mentioned elsewhere in the requirements.  Can you please confirm the contractor's responsibility is probate case preparation only?
RESPONSE:   Only "Case Preparation" services are required;  "Case Closing" services are not a part of this requirement.


QUESTION 2:   On page 17 of the solicitation under B. Government provided costs, will the Security Background Investigation costs include fingerprinting?
RESPONSE:   Fingerprint costs are not provided by the Government  (just as the Government/BIA does not pay for applicant's fingerprint costs for federal job vacancies).


QUESTION 3:   We cannot reconcile the language between Section 9.2.1 that states "only approximately 2 on-site employees will remain to complete the Option Year requirement" and the language in M.1.b.3 states "Option 1:  50 cases  X 55 hrs = approx 2750 hrs" and M.1.b.4 -"Option 2:  50 cases X 55 hrs = approx. 2750 hrs".  If the expectation is approximately 2 people remaining in the option, was the 2750 hours an error?
RESPONSE:   Historically, the Case Prep work load for each employee averages 25 cases at any given time.  50 cases, under each Option Year/Performance Period, will only require two individuals to complete the services.


QUESTION 4:   Please resolve a discrepancy issue regarding NAICS code.  The RFQ's 1449 lists 525920.  The NBC Solicitation web interface lists 532111 (Passenger Car Rental).  We believe the NBC web page is in error, please confirm.
RESPONSE:   The SF 1449 solicitation document's  "525920"  NAICS code is the correct code.

<SUBJECT>The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) Biorepository
<SOLNBR>HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RFP-10-131
<RESPDATE>081810
<CONTACT>Rosanne S Wilson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-4433, Fax 301-443-0501, Email wilsonr@mail.nih.gov - Craig D. Sager, Senior Contracting Officer , Phone 301-443-1193, Fax (301) 443-0501, Email csager@mail.nih.gov
<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Aging (NIA), intends to negotiate, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, on a noncompetitive, sole source basis, with the Regents of the University of Michigan, DRDA for the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) Biorepository requirement.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources may express their<br />interest by submitting a capability statement or proposal. All capability statement/proposals received within fifteen<br />days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the<br />Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the<br />discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of<br />determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This effort will be one base year with four option years (12 months for each performance year).</p>
<p>The SWAN Biorepository is in accordance with the authority 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to continue to support SWAN Biorepository activities related to receiving, storing, cataloging, preserving and distributing specimens to qualified investigators. The collection of biospecimens are frozen and currently housed in the SWAN Biorepository (in Frederick, MD) in sixty-five (65) 80oC mechanical freezers purchased by the University of Michigan (funds from a federal grant supporting the SWAN Biorepository). There are 1.7 million irreplaceable and highly perishable biological specimens (whole blood, serum, plasma, urine, extracted DNA, buccal cells, immortalized cells) contained in these freezers. The contractor will continue to provide sufficient freezer capacity (using these freezers) at the Frederick, MD location in order to 1) avoid redundant freezer and relocation costs and 2) reduce the risk of loss of viability of cells and progress made by SWAN over the last ten years.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall use the existing electronic inventory management system developed for and used by the SWAN Biorepository to manage the biospecimen inventory. This Specimen Inventory Management System) shall include the following features: 1) biospecimen management; 2) requisition/workflow tracking; 3) freezer/inventory management; 4) comprehensive reporting; 5) shipment and discrepancy tracking; and 6) security features. The inventory system shall be customizable to meet the changing needs of the SWAN Biorepository. The Contractor shall maintain and update electronic systems and procedures to ensure data security and to prevent loss of inventory data in case of physical damage or equipment failure. The Contractor shall maintain and update electronic and physical systems that prevent access to biospecimens and data by unauthorized individuals. The University of Michigan is the sole proprietor of the specific version of the inventory management system developed for and used by the SWAN repository; therefore, there is limited access to the data management system itself.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall maintain/obtain the required shipping licenses and permits from local, State, Federal and international authorities for the safe import, storage and distribution of biological specimens, according to current regulatory guidelines, as applicable. The Contractor shall provide proof of required licenses prior to contract award.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall maintain and update as necessary, the "SWAN Data Warehouse", a searchable, concept-driven website to promote understanding of the SWAN Study and its data and biospecimen resources, provide access to SWAN data and support all Biorepository utilization functions. The website must comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act or the Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards pertaining to all of 36 CFR 1194.21 and 36 CFR 1194.22.</p>
<p>Relocating sixty five freezers to another location would pose a considerable risk to the SWAN project and the 1.7 million irreplaceable and highly perishable biological specimens housed in the freezers; the current specimen inventory management system is based on proprietary software which is of limited access; a potential change between contractors would entail costly delays and disruptions in performance and potential loss of valuable data, specimens or specimen integrity. An award issued to a contractor other than the incumbent would include redundant spending by the Government to purchase and develop a new data management system and an additional set of 65 freezers (both of which are outside the funding limitations for this requirement).</p>
<p>In summary, inherent risk of loss of perishable resources, duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this study.</p>
<p><br />Background and Purpose of the SWAN Biorepository:</p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) continues to have a need for collecting, storing, monitoring and distributing blood, urine and DNA samples for the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). The SWAN Biorepository has been supported since 2000 by a National Institutes of Health (NIH) research project grant mechanism (to the University of Michigan) which is separate from the SWAN clinical field sites, coordinating center and central laboratory. This requirement shifts the SWAN award mechanism from a grant to a contract.</p>
<p>SWAN is an ongoing multi-ethnic longitudinal study conducted by seven (7) clinical field sites, a data coordinating center and a central laboratory. It is designed to characterize the physiological and psychosocial changes that occur during menopause and beyond. SWAN has an extensive base of well characterized data and a repository of biological specimens from 3,302 African American, Chinese, Caucasian, Japanese and Hispanic women with over twelve years of annual follow-up visits that describe the endocrinology of the menopause transition and other factors relevant to midlife health and aging. The women, who ranged in age from 42 to 52 years at enrollment in 1996-97, will continue to be followed until they are 59-69 years old under an existing grant mechanism which expires in 2014 (and is separate from this repository requirement). SWAN has the capability to link the expansive biological, medical, social, behavioral, and demographic data it has collected over seventeen years to the development of both positive and deleterious health conditions, disorders and diseases in early old age. The major thematic areas of SWAN include 1) Physical Functioning; 2) Bone/Osteoporosis; 3) Cognitive Function/ Symptoms/ Mental Health; 4) Diabetes/Cardiovascular disease; 5) Physical functional performance and 6) Osteoarthritis.</p>
<p>The SWAN repository has accrued 1.7 million samples of serum, plasma, urine, DNA that were meticulously collected and managed from 3,302 women from five race/ethnic groups followed annually prior to, during and after the menopausal transition. The SWAN Biorepository is an integral arm of SWAN intended to support and facilitate (the collection, processing and storage of new specimens from the ongoing study) and extend the SWAN core study to allow the efficient evaluation of new and untested existing hypotheses. The repository specimens consist of 578,000 serum, plasma and urine samples, one million urine samples from the Daily Hormone Study (an annual study of hormone patterns across a full menstrual cycle nested within the parent study) and 26,300 DNA samples (including 7,928 vials of immortalized cells from more than 1,500 participants). SWAN will continue participant follow-up visits and longitudinal data collection between 2010 and 2014. As a result, it is anticipated that an additional 113,792 new serum, plasma and urine samples will be generated for in the SWAN repository.</p>
<p>The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) Biorepository is a component of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) study. The purpose of the SWAN Biorepository is to provide a resource designed to receive, store, catalog, preserve and distribute specimens to qualified investigators. The SWAN Biorepository is needed to 1) support collection and storage of biological specimens from planned follow-up visits in the ongoing SWAN study; 2) provide for the continued management of the current biorepository specimens; 3) provide for continued administration of the review process for requests for specimens and management of specimen distribution; and 4) develop strategies to promote utilization of specimens. The contract shall provide and implement Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures for prospective evaluation of short and long term specimen management, including identification and removal of non-useful specimens as well as refinement of specimen cataloging.</p>
<p>This proposed acquisition was previously publicized under sources sought notices HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-<br />SBSS-10-131 and HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RDSS-10-131.</p>
<p>The estimated contract award date will be on or about June 30, 2011</p>

<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Aging (NIA), intends to negotiate, under auThe National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Aging (NIA), intends to negotiate, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, on a noncompetitive, sole source basis, with the Regents of the University of Michigan, DRDA for the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) Biorepository requirement.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources may express their<br />interest by submitting a capability statement or proposal. All capability statement/proposals received within fifteen<br />days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the<br />Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the<br />discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of<br />determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This effort will be one base year with four option years (12 months for each performance year).</p>
<p>The SWAN Biorepository is in accordance with the authority 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to continue to support SWAN Biorepository activities related to receiving, storing, cataloging, preserving and distributing specimens to qualified investigators. The collection of biospecimens are frozen and currently housed in the SWAN Biorepository (in Frederick, MD) in sixty-five (65) 80oC mechanical freezers purchased by the University of Michigan (funds from a federal grant supporting the SWAN Biorepository). There are 1.7 million irreplaceable and highly perishable biological specimens (whole blood, serum, plasma, urine, extracted DNA, buccal cells, immortalized cells) contained in these freezers. The contractor will continue to provide sufficient freezer capacity (using these freezers) at the Frederick, MD location in order to 1) avoid redundant freezer and relocation costs and 2) reduce the risk of loss of viability of cells and progress made by SWAN over the last ten years.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall use the existing electronic inventory management system developed for and used by the SWAN Biorepository to manage the biospecimen inventory. This Specimen Inventory Management System) shall include the following features: 1) biospecimen management; 2) requisition/workflow tracking; 3) freezer/inventory management; 4) comprehensive reporting; 5) shipment and discrepancy tracking; and 6) security features. The inventory system shall be customizable to meet the changing needs of the SWAN Biorepository. The Contractor shall maintain and update electronic systems and procedures to ensure data security and to prevent loss of inventory data in case of physical damage or equipment failure. The Contractor shall maintain and update electronic and physical systems that prevent access to biospecimens and data by unauthorized individuals. The University of Michigan is the sole proprietor of the specific version of the inventory management system developed for and used by the SWAN repository; therefore, there is limited access to the data management system itself.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall maintain/obtain the required shipping licenses and permits from local, State, Federal and international authorities for the safe import, storage and distribution of biological specimens, according to current regulatory guidelines, as applicable. The Contractor shall provide proof of required licenses prior to contract award.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall maintain and update as necessary, the "SWAN Data Warehouse", a searchable, concept-driven website to promote understanding of the SWAN Study and its data and biospecimen resources, provide access to SWAN data and support all Biorepository utilization functions. The website must comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act or the Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards pertaining to all of 36 CFR 1194.21 and 36 CFR 1194.22.</p>
<p>Relocating sixty five freezers to another location would pose a considerable risk to the SWAN project and the 1.7 million irreplaceable and highly perishable biological specimens housed in the freezers; the current specimen inventory management system is based on proprietary software which is of limited access; a potential change between contractors would entail costly delays and disruptions in performance and potential loss of valuable data, specimens or specimen integrity. An award issued to a contractor other than the incumbent would include redundant spending by the Government to purchase and develop a new data management system and an additional set of 65 freezers (both of which are outside the funding limitations for this requirement).</p>
<p>In summary, inherent risk of loss of perishable resources, duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this study.</p>
<p><br />Background and Purpose of the SWAN Biorepository:</p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) continues to have a need for collecting, storing, monitoring and distributing blood, urine and DNA samples for the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). The SWAN Biorepository has been supported since 2000 by a National Institutes of Health (NIH) research project grant mechanism (to the University of Michigan) which is separate from the SWAN clinical field sites, coordinating center and central laboratory. This requirement shifts some functions from the previous SWAN grant award mechanism to a contract. The government does not anticipate an overlap between the current grant and new contract requirements. The grant support will ensure that the SWAN biorepository is able to meet the (immediate) needs of the ongoing SWAN study (and new sample collection) whereas the contract requirement will ensure the long-term, sustained availability of the existing samples stored by the SWAN biorepository to the broader, outside scientific research community.</p>
<p>SWAN is an ongoing multi-ethnic longitudinal study conducted by seven (7) clinical field sites, a data coordinating center and a central laboratory.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   This announcement is amended to provide the following additional information regarding the rationale for this sole source requirement:   the Panalytical Epsilon 5 is the only known EDXRF spectrometer that possesses a combination of the following NEIC requirements.  1) A100 kV tube is required in order to analyze the K-lines of heavier [above Barium] elements.  2) A Germanium detector is necessary as NEIC requires 100% efficiency up to at least 50 keV in order to determine the identity of heavier elements.  3) Polarizing optics are required on the detector as the significantly lower detection limits achieved - for effectively analyzing elements of environmental importance and precious metals found in automotive catalysts - are essential.  4) Compton scattering for matrix correction is required as NEIC needs a level of matrix correction which is only achievable via multiple Compton peaks. No solicitation or Request For Quote (RFQ) is available for this procurement.  Nevertheless, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the EPA requirements described herein may submit a response; which, if received by the closing date of this announcement, will be considered.
Responses to this announcement must be in writing.  A determination not to compete the described purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Federal Government.  Any questions should be directed to Michael Gilham via electronic mail (see below).

<p>For this procurement, EPA requires firms to organize their information in the SF 330 and any additional documentation, as described below. EPA will evaluate firms SF 330s and additional documentation on the&nbsp;four evaluation criteria listed below.</p>
<p>Firms should submit 10 hard-copies and one electronic copy (on disc in a MS Word or PDF Format) of their SF 330s. If documents are submitted utilizing Portable Document Format (PDF) firms shall follow the conventions described under the accessibility guidelines which are described in the authoring tools section of Acrobat Reader. For more information on this guidance, please visit www.section508.gov.</p>
<p>Following the Architect/Engineer Evaluation Board's (AEEB) review of the SF 330 and supporting documentation, the AEEB will develop a "short list" of the most highly rated firms. The short-listed firms will be referred to as "selected firms."</p>
<p>The source selection authority will make the final ranking from among those "selected firms." The top ranked firm will then be asked to submit:</p>
<p>&bull; Conflict of Interest Plan<br />&bull; Quality Management Plan<br />&bull; Representations and Certifications<br />&bull; Cost Proposal</p>
<p>Instructions for the preparation for each of these submissions will only be provided to the firm with whom EPA intends to conduct negotiations.</p>
<p>Specific Proposal Instructions</p>

<AWARDEE>3M Company, 3M Center, Government Markets
Bldg, 225-4N-15, Saint Paul, MN 55144-1000 US
<DESC>A sole source blanket purchase agreement (BPA) was awarded to 3M Company, headquartered in Saint Paul, MN. The BPA is restricted to Petrifilm brand and Tecra brand testing supplies used for grain commodity testing under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).
<p>The total amount of the award is not to exceed $250,000.00 over a 5-year period of performance.</p>
<p>Justification Statement:</p>
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), GIPSA (Grain, Inspection, Packers &amp; Stockyards Administration), TSD (Technical Services Division) Laboratory in Kansas City, MO is responsible for maintaining the reference methods for all official services provided by GIPSA to facilitate the marketing of grain, providing official services, and developing and maintaining methods for accurately predicting the quality of grain and grain products moving through the U.S. marketplace. GIPSA has standardized specific commodity testing protocols to ensure accuracy and consistency of GIPSA's test results. The standardized microbial testing uses Petrifilm&reg; and Tecra&reg; brand test plates, and test kits that are solely available from 3M. Based on market research by GIPSA scientists, the use of another company's test plates and or test kits would require extensive testing, and the current methods using 3M products are accepted by the international trading partners of the U.S.</p>

<DESC>The work consists of furnishing all labor, supervision, tools, materials, and equipment necessary to perform Operation and Maintenance Services for DOD Army Medical Facilities nationwide, including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.  Anticipated work contains full-service, continuous-coverage operation and maintenance (O&M) of medical facilities to include preventive, predictive, demand, and emergency maintenance.  In addition, task orders may be awarded for construction requirements incidental to O&M (such as installation/extension of utilities, minor reconfiguration of treatment areas to support new medical equipment, etc).  There are a wide variety of buildings and finishes (and a variety of building ages and conditions) that will be covered on any given O&M Task Order.  Buildings vary from World War II lapped siding to new pre-engineered metal buildings to towering steel-frame pre-cast concrete skinned multi-story buildings.  Example systems and equipment include but are not limited to emergency generators; electrical switchgear; electrical distribution; lighting; plumbing systems; roof and storm drain systems; heating ventilation, and air conditioning [HVAC] heating boilers; HVAC water chillers; HVAC cooling towers; HVAC pumps; variable frequency motor controllers; HVAC air handling units; operating room and isolation room pressurization systems; digital HVAC controls; nurse call; patient monitoring systems; intrusion detection systems; infant abduction systems; fire detection/alarm systems; fire sprinkler systems; carbon dioxide, wet and dry chemical fire suppression systems; elevators; pneumatic tube and box conveyor transport systems; medical gas systems to include medical air compressors, medical vacuum pumps, bulk oxygen tank farms, and medical gas and vacuum distribution and alarm panels; laboratory fume hoods; interior finishes; signage systems; structural building components such as roofs and building exterior fa ade; and passive fire protection systems (including fire and smoke partition integrity maintenance).  Contractors must be aware of the health and life safety issues that must be considered while performing these demanding O&M tasks in an occupied medical treatment facility - many with a critically ill inpatient population.  Specific requirements, such as the stringent infection control measures in place at all medical treatment facilities, will be identified in the individual task orders, but Contractors are advised that special requirements (to include requirements ranging from badging to immunization requirements for individual workers) are typically required because the work will be performed in occupied medical treatment and/or medical research facilities.<BR><BR>The Government awarded five Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts resulting from this solicitation which will include a base year. Options one thru four may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.   Firm Fixed-Price Task Orders will be issued against the contracts. The total maximum value to be shared amongst all contracts awarded under this solicitation is $200,000,000.00.<BR>
