<DESC>Notice of Intent:  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends to award to the Colorado State University a requirement for the development of an accurate, up to date fish hauling table for fish of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (SSJD) to be used at the Tracy Fish Collection Facility (TFCF).  The updated table will be used by TFCF fish diversion workers and biologists as a tool to reduce fish stress, mortality, and aid in the health of fish during transportation back to the delta.  A further objective is to determine the maximum holding and transporting densities for the fishes of concern of the SSJD: delta smelt [Hypomesus transpacificus], Sacramento splittail [Pogonichthys macrolepidotus]and threadfin shad [Dorosoma petenense]. Reclamation has identified the Colorado State University, as the only source both economically and technically capable of performing the required evaluations, based on their proximity to USBR's Denver Fisheries Laboratory, expertise and experience in the area, and capability of their local CSU laboratory.  The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the services that will satisfy the agency's requirements.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  Firms believing they can provide a similar required service must provide supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  All responses received within 5 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by FAX at (303) 445-6345, Attention: John Collins or e-mail at JCOLLINS@do.usbr.gov.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for NAICS Code 541690 which is $6 Million.  This notice may represent the only official notice of the solicitation.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice to determine the availability of potential sources to perform computer modeling work on the North American Animal Disease Spread Model (NAADSM).

Description of Work:
The NAADSM simulates infectious disease spread from unit-to-unit, and illustrates possible outcomes and the potential impact of interventions.  In order to produce valuable results for highly pathogenic avian influenza, the NAADSM requires input parameters derived from detailed data, such as the type of poultry operation, flock size and location, poultry movement, movement of objects contaminated with the virus, and management factors and other variables that contribute to the spread of the disease.  Once the input parameters are identified by USDA:APHIS, the computer modeler will evaluate the model and contribute ideas about potential improvements.  The modeler should have experience with multiple types of models, scenario planning, parameterization and general use of models in the animal disease framework.    

USDA:APHIS shall furnish equipment and data necessary to exercise the model.  Prefer the individual to spend part of the time on-site at USDA:APHIS (Ft Collins, CO) to allow maximum interaction with the modeling team and contribute to a rapid understanding of the modeling effort.  

No additional details are availabe at this time.

If you are interested in this opportunity send an e-mail to Irene Hess, Irene.E.Hess@aphis.usda.gov.  Include any relevant information regarding skill sets and past similar experiences.
