The VEB System is required to self-adjust to lake surface levels between elevations 350.0 feet and 475.5 feet.  For further information concerning all the principal components of the work, please see the solicitation.  Solicitation 06SP201059 will be posted at http://ideasec.nbc.gov on or about July 11, 2006.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

Drainage is to the west toward the Little Powder River, located less than ? mile from the project.    Job Description: The job consists of pulling a government furnished Dixie Harrow using a tractor of sufficient size to remove sagebrush cover and scarify the soil surface. The resource management objectives are to break up the sagebrush fuel continuity, and improve habitat conditions for greater sage grouse. The treatment objective is to treat approximately 200 acres within the 600 acre treatment units.  There will also be an option to treat an additional 100 acres.   Treatment specifications: The design of the Dixie Harrow plow allows the operator to remove harrow sections to decrease the severity of surface disturbance. The normal treatment will include use of the harrow with all sections attached. The government Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) may require the contractor to treat specified areas using the harrow with one or more sections removed, and or make a second pass in the opposite direction of the first in order to achieve the desired degree of surface disturbance. The harrow treatment blocks shall be irregular-shaped with the harrowing completed in a mosaic of treated and untreated strips. The plowing treatment will be made in an alternating pattern of plowed and un-plowed strips that generally follow the contour of the land and running perpendicular to the slope and watershed drainage. The plowed strips shall be 100 feet or less in width, un-plowed strips shall be 30 to 200 foot or more in width. Generally, un-plowed strips shall be twice as wide as the plowed strips. Surface Conditions:  Harrowing shall not occur under conditions that prevent the proper kill of sagebrush and the proper operation of equipment. These conditions include snow, frozen ground or when the soil exceeds 15% moisture content. Tractor:  Shall be of sufficient size and horsepower to pull the pipe harrow. Minimum tractor requirements are a 150 drawbar horsepower, 4-wheel drive rubber tired tractor or 2WD with dual liquid-filled rear tires. The pipe harrow shall not be pulled in excess of 6 six miles per hour.  Work limits: Work can be completed in August/September/October 2006. The government will flag and/or show contractor the boundaries of treatment areas. Work Measurement: The government will mark the boundary of the treatment areas with engineering tape or pin flags. Each pass with the harrow will count as treated surface. The workload measure for payment under this contract will be the number of acres treated. Calculation of treated acres will be determined by measuring the length of each treated strip and multiplying by the width of the harrow. The length measurements will be made by either ground measure (tape or measuring wheel) or using shape file data collected from a GPS unit mounted on the tractor or an ATV. All of the acreage measurements for payment of the contract will be on a horizontal plane.    Environmental Considerations:  The contractor shall be responsible to clean up the project site and all refuse removed as directed by the Contracting Officer.  Flagged archaeological sites, section corners and leave areas (untreated islands, big game travel lanes, rocky/shallow soil etc.) located within the project area, shall not be disturbed by the Contractor's operations. Existing access roads and roads/jeep trails within the project area that are damaged by the Contractor shall be restored (Contractor's expense) to the same condition they were in at the commencement of work. Work will be stopped on days/times of extreme fire danger and/or if wet/muddy road conditions exist, the government will monitor these conditions. Government Supplied Equipment: The government will provide the Dixie Harrow which will be delivered and unloaded at the job site. Upon completion of work the contractor will return the Dixie Harrow to the closest access point on the Highway 59 Right-of-way.  Project Meetings Show Trip: A project show trip for prospective bidders will be held on June 20, 2006. The meeting time and place may be obtained by contacting the Buffalo Field Office at (307) 684-1100.   Pre-Work Conference: A pre-work conference will be held prior to the start of work. The Contractor will be notified in advance of the meeting time, date, and place. The purpose will be to review required work, project specifications, schedules, payroll and payments, and administrative provisions of the Contract.  During Work Contact: The contractor shall contact the contracting officer's representative (COR), in the Buffalo Field Office, a minimum every other day and/or prior to moving from one treatment area to another to report project status including acres completed.  Final Inspection: The Contractor shall notify the COR at least one business day in advance of completion of the project, so the Government can schedule a final inspection. The Contractor shall correct deficiencies identified and the treatment project will be re-inspected. Payment: Payment will be made for the actual number of acres completed, inspected, and accepted by the Government. The acreage for the purpose of payment is measured on a horizontal plane. The contractor may, at any time during the course of the contract, request re-measurement of any unit he/she thinks is not accurately measured. The method of measurement for acreage determination is discussed in the Work Measurement section.  Contract Award: Award will be based upon the overall advantage to the government including not only price but past performance and ability to perform by the due date the subject contract work.

With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation !  will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gathe!  r information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the  official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.

Participants will be limited to the current J-UCAS sources, which are:  The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Boeing Company (Boeing); and the Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (Northrop).  Boeing and Northrop are the only known responsible sources with the required technical expertise to satisfy the Government’s requirements.  Award to any source other than current J-UCAS participants would result in significant schedule delays as well as substantial duplication of costs that would not be recovered through full and open competition.  The Demonstration System effort will be structured to mature critical technologies and reduce risk for aircraft carrier integration of an operationally relevant UCAS with a Low Observable (LO) planform.  The N-UCAS demonstration shall include, but is not limited to, Carrier Control Approach (CCA) operations, launch and recovery, deck operations and supportability.  Activities will focus towards a suitability demonstration of a relevant LO planform aboard ship no later than 2011.  The UCAS demonstration system will include an Air Vehicle (AV) and Mission Control System (MCS) design approach.  All correspondence, Request for Proposals and Questions and Answers will be posted to the NAVAIR website at http://www.navair.navy.mil (select <Doing Business> and then select <Open Solicitations>).  A draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) is planned to be released in the May 2006 timeframe.  All questions and correspondence regarding this synopsis shall be sent to the Contracting Officer at Lori.Frame@navy.mil.

The statutory authority permitting this award under other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This is not a solicitation. See numbered Note 22. Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm.

17. The Navy intends to procure on a sole source basis from Bluesky Mast, Inc. 1202 W North B St., Tampa, FL 33606, 10 (ten) 15 (fifteen) Meter Antenna Masts Part Number BSM2-M-M215-JBS-000, to support currently deployed sloping V long wire antennas.  The antenna masts must be capable of supporting the following antennas:  CSA Longshot (A 500-foot long wire antenna. It is important to note that the 500-foot long wire antenna requires a mast capable of sustaining 90 pounds pull at the top of the mast in a single direction. This is the approximate force required to properly deploy the long wire antenna.); AS3166 (VHF-FM low bands); DC80 (VHF & UHF frequency bands); AT197 A/GR (UHF & AM bands); and SC303B (SATCOM).  The mast system must include any adapters needed to affix the identified antennas to the mast system.  The masts must be strong enough to support the 500-foot long sloping V antennas, yet flexible enough to bend without breaking; even in the event of extreme conditions, thus preventing a catastrophic failure.  The mast systems must be lightweight enough to be one man portable and must be deployable by a trained individual within 15-20 minutes, depending on wind conditions.  Due to the variety of environments in which the masts will be deployed, the mast systems must be comprised of corrosion free materials and sealed components where possible to prevent the detrimental effects of sand and dirt.  The mast solution must be capable of supporting fifty pounds up to a height of fifteen meters. The mast systems must allow the operators to change antennas during a mission in 5 minutes, excluding antenna assembly time.  This could be accomplished via a winching system with a carriage assembly. The carriage assembly must be capable of elevating the antennas and hold them in place without listing beyond functional deployment. The accessory arms on the carriage assembly must be capable of optional lengths from 24 inches to 48 inches. There must also be an option to use the accessory arms at different angles to provide proper separation of large antennas.  The mast systems must accommodate deploying at least two antennas simultaneously.  The mast systems must be capable of operational wind speeds of seventy miles per hour.  The mast systems must also be able to be loaded onto a 436L pallet without the need for special accommodations, such as special racks. Additional accessories required for the mast include; Aluminum/Stainless Steel/Delrin Tripod, Winch, Cable for Winch, mast adapters and Guys Spectra® 1000 by Honeywell.  No telephone responses will be accepted.  
18.  The required delivery date for these masts, based on an award by 19 Jul 2006, is 3 Aug 2006 to NAWCAD, Webster Field, St. Inigoes, MD 20684.  *****

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/FEMA, Emergency Management Institute (EMI), National Emergency Training Center (NETC) has a requirement for development of course modules and exercises for a new Integrated Emergency Management Course (IEMC), Natural Hazards, Tornado.  This requirement will be set aside 100% for small business.  The NAICS code is 611710, Educational Services, and the small business size standard is $6.5 million [average annual receipts for three preceding fiscal years].  Award of a firm-fixed-price purchase order, using simplified acquisition procedures, is anticipated.  The award will be made based on Best Value to the Government, in accordance with the evaluation factors and minimum qualifications set forth herein and in the Request for Quotation (RFQ) package.  Quotes will be due 14 working days from the release date of the RFQ package.  Potential offerors must request the Request for Quotation package in writing, no later than July 12, 2006, by sending their request to ATTN: Teresa Dingle, Contract Specialist, via email to teresa.dingle@dhs.gov.   RFQ packages will be sent to potential offerors via email only; therefore, offerors shall include a point of contact name and email address with their request for the RFQ package.  The IEMC program has been in existence for over 24 years and offers various courses with concentration in specific hazard areas such as earthquakes, hurricanes, hazardous materials and homeland security.  Over time courses require materials to be updated and new scenarios need to be developed in order to provide functional exercises to be used to provide experiential training to a diverse audience of students from many professional disciplines involved in responding to, and supporting emergency operations in times of disasters, inclusive of the disciplines of law enforcement, fire service, public works, emergency medical services, emergency management, schools, voluntary agencies, and elected officials.  The existing IEMC All Hazards Preparedness and Response Course (E900)  needs to be updated and this project will entail reviewing the existing course materials and scenarios for this course and developing a new course that will be entitled IEMC-Natural Hazard Tornado Course.  This new course will require a new unit sequence similar to the E900 course. Some existing E900 course modules could be incorporated into the new course; however, it is envisioned that some new course modules will need to be developed.  New course modules will include a 1-hour module on the tornado hazard (a case study of a recent major tornado and its impact on a specific community).  Another module would include recovering from a tornado strike to include recovery problems such as debris management and restoring infrastructure and economic normalcy to the community  The Natural Hazard Tornado Course shall contain three exercises: Exercise One (approximately 90 min.) serves to introduce the course participants on how the course exercises are conducted and shall address preparedness issues as well as some normal response issues involving first responders; Exercise Two (main exercise, approximately 4 hours) involves responding to the consequences of a large tornado strike and shall involve first responders, support agencies, volunteer organizations, and mutual aid organizations from surrounding communities; Exercise Three (short-term recovery exercise, approximately 2 hours) shall be built on the previous exercise and address follow-up issues such as sheltering, public health issues, debris removal and returning economic viability to the community, etc.  While most incidents are handled on a daily basis by a single jurisdiction at the local level, there are important instances in which successful domestic incident management operations depend on the involvement of multiple jurisdictions, functional agencies, and emergency responder disciplines.  These instances require the effective and efficient coordination across the broad spectrum of organizations and activities.  To accomplish this, the IEMC series uses exercises to test the skills and abilities of the course participants (composed of first responders and support organizations from public works, EMS, Fire Service, law enforcement, emergency management, and volunteer agencies) to respond to and recover from situations created as a result of a specific hazard.  Exercises developed for the Natural Hazards Tornado Course shall use the existing exercise format used by the IEMC Program The Central City Model Community as the community impacted.  The new course materials and exercises shall be consistent with the National Incident Management System (NIMS).  The NIMS uses a systems approach to integrate the best of existing processes and methods into a unified national framework for incident management.  Two of the key components of the system include the Incident Management Team (IMT) concept and its integration with the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) as part of the NIMS multi-agency coordination system.  The IMT concept is the foundation of incident management outlined as part of the Incident Command System (ICS) in the NIMS document.  The IMT includes the incident commander and appropriate command and general staff personnel assigned to an incident.  ICS is a management system designed to enable effective and efficient domestic incident management by integrating a combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and communications within a common organizational structure.  The course development is designed to accomplish the following objectives:  provide students with a knowledge of tornado hazard to include preparing for, responding to, and recovering from a major tornado strike; through course exercises, provide an opportunity to show how first responders, municipal and state support agencies, and community volunteer agencies can provide essential roles in responding to and recovering from major tornado strike(s); highlight the importance of establishing a clear line of communications with the IMT, the EOC, and other elements of the multi-agency coordination system; highlight the importance of chief elected and appointed officials in the integration of IMT and EOC concepts; provide students with practice in implementing an IMT and activating an EOC; provide students with practice in establishing procedures for the gathering, verification, coordination, and dissemination of public information; provide students with practice in the management of resources during a simulated incident.  The Contractor shall follow the listed steps in order to successfully complete this course development:  (1) Initial Project Meeting; (2) Work Plan Development; (3) Conduct a Focus Group Meeting; (4) Develop a Draft Plan of Instruction; (5) Develop Draft Student Materials; (6) Develop Draft Instructor Materials; (7) Develop Draft Course Visuals; (8) Develop Exercise/Scenario Materials; (9) Participate in the Evaluation of Pilot Offering #1; (10) Revise Draft Student Materials, Instructor Materials, and Visuals as needed after the Pilot Offering; (11) Finalize Student Materials, Instructor Materials, and Visuals for the course.  In order to be qualified for award of a purchase order for this requirement, the offer must demonstrate the following minimum qualifications: (1) Knowledge and experience in developing IEMC-type exercises; (2) Knowledge of first responders and support disciplines, roles, and responsibilities in responding to a major tornado strike; (3) Knowledge and understanding of the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and how it would be applied by local government in responding to a major tornado strike; (4) Knowledge of Incident Management Teams (IMT) and how they would be used in response to a major tornado strike; (5) A basic knowledge of hurricane meteorology to include weather conditions likely to spawn tornados and the appropriate use of tornado watches and tornado warnings.

<SUBJECT>70 -- 70  ADP Software Screen Refacing
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-SSA-OTHER-0199
<RESPDATE>071706
<ARCHDATE>08012006
<CONTACT>Kathy Fain, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-965-4853, Fax 410-965-9560, Email kathryn.fain@ssa.gov
<DESC>Description:  This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  Reference SSA-OTHER-0199 when responding to this announcement.  The Social Security Administration is seeking vendors capable of providing a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software product that supports screen refacing (SR).  Screen refacing is a programming technique where a graphical user interface (GUI) is created â€œon the flyâ€ from character based block-oriented presentation data streams.  SSA intends to use screen refacing software to rapidly develop and deploy an environment that augments the agencyâ€™s character-based terminal emulation (3270 / 5250) screens with a standardized GUI.  The minimum FUNCTIONAL CAPABILITIES are as follows: A) Support Microsoft Windows standard GUI presentation controls (as implemented by comctl32.dll).  These include, but are not limited to: Button, Combo Box, Drag List Box, Edit, Flat Scroll Bar, Header, List Box, List-View, Progress Bar, Property Sheets, Rich Edit, Scroll Bars, ToolTip, Trackbar, Tree-View, Up-Down; B) Support compound controls made up of the preceding elements.  The controls must be capable of being processed by SSAâ€™s assistive technology (AT) products - see â€œAccessibility Requirementsâ€ (below); C)Be non-invasive â€“ requiring no changes to SSA mainframe systems or network infrastructure; D) Include an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports the rapid development, testing, and deployment of the refaced screens to SSAâ€™s production environment; E) Be capable of presenting both GUI and character-based interfaces to usersâ€”based on individual user preferenceâ€”when deployed in SSAâ€™s production environment; F) Provide the ability for users to toggle within the same terminal session, from GUI to "green screen" (& vice versa) and retain user entered information.  To support this, the GUI screens presented by the SR software must interoperate with the existing z/OS Customer Information Control System (CICS) and IBM iSeries (AS/400) application systemsâ€™ 3270 and 5250 presentations â€“ not replace them.  All interaction with the online applications must be through the character-based screens using IBM Personal Communications (PCOMM) terminal emulation software; G) Enable the refaced screens to coexist (and not conflict) with SSAâ€™s custom-developed applications that directly interact with PCOMM to â€œscrapeâ€ and â€œstuffâ€ screens. These applications use the Extended High Level Language Application Programming Interface (EHLLAPI or Windows HLLAPI) or Host Access Class Library (HACL) to interact with PCOMM. SSA must retain the functionality of hundreds of SSA-developed PCOMM macros or scripts when implementing the SR software product.  The minimum SOFTWARE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS are as follows for the IDE of the vendors software solution:  must be able to A) Execute on Microsoft Windows XP Professional or higher; B) Integrate with the MKS Source Integrity Enterprise version control tool;  C)Facilitate the creation of GUI screens by: i) Importing Basic Mapping Service (BMS) source files to create initial GUI screen definitions; ii)Importing Data Description Specification (DDS) source files to create initial AS/400 screen definitions; iii)Identifying screen definition changes when importing updated BMS and/or DDS source files by providing alerts to SSAâ€™s change notification process when imported maps have changed.  The SR execution or run-time environment of the vendorâ€™s SR software solution must: D) 1) Treat each 3270 / 5250 screen as a separate, discreet event.  At SSA the sequence of screen presentation (screen flow) is defined in the underlying business applications.  These paths are not static but are dynamically determined by information entered on previous screens i.e., the CICS next screen is determined from data in the current screen.  The SR software must not depend on predefined screen flows to function properly;  2) Properly process attribute bytes, including conditionally protected fields, field colors, conditionally hidden fields, and extended attribute bytes (EAB); 3)Differentiate between transactions that have same screen names but different screen formats; 4)Automatically switch focus to the terminal emulator character-based screen if for any reason the SR software cannot fully determine the GUI screen equivalent. The SR software must switch focus to the terminal emulator character-based presentation for screens if: i) The SR software encounters a non-defined screen;  ii) The SR software encounters a screen that is in conflict with the format that the SR software expects;  E) The generated GUI screens of the vendorâ€™s SR software solution must: 1) Be testable with Mercury Interactive testing products; 2) Be testable with assistive technology (see â€œAccessibility Requirementsâ€) (below); F)  The SR software and the generated GUI screen definitions of the vendorâ€™s SR software solution must: 1) Be distributable with HP OpenView Radia, 2)Be distributable with Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS).  G) The vendorâ€™s SR software solution must support the loading of screen definitions across a LAN or WAN and must support the caching of screen definitions on the workstation. H) The vendorâ€™s SR software solution must operate within SSAâ€™s computing environment:  1)Microsoft Windows XP Professional or higher; 2) IBM z/OS mainframes; 3) IBM CICS transaction processing; 4) IBM OS/400 mid-range computers; 5) SNA/LLC mainframe (3270) network environment (current environment); 6)TCP/IP mainframe (tn3270) network environment (future environment); 7)OS/400 (5250)â€”TCP/IP tn5250 network environment; 8) IBM Personal Communications for Windows Version 5.8.  The minimum SYSTEM SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS are as follows: SSA will require vendor support for the A) installation; B) maintenance; C) training of developers in the use of the SR IDE;  D) development consulting services; E) technical support; and F) support for SSA assistive technology (see â€œAccessibility Requirements).   The minimum ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS are as follows: A) shall meet the applicable accessibility standards required in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended 29 U.S.C. Â§ 794 (d);  and B) shall have the ability to be processed by SSAâ€™s assistive technology (AT) products.  Information on the accessibility standards prescribed by law is available at the official website: http://www.section508.gov.   Information on by SSAâ€™s Assistive Technology (AT) products, including JAWS, MAGic, and Dragon Naturally Speaking, can be found at http://www.ssa.gov/oag/acq/oagacq_508.htm.  NOTE: Interested vendors must provide verifiable proof in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to meet accessibility requirements.  SSA does perform rigorous testing for Section 508 compliance.  Vendors are required to submit prototypical screens containing all GUI presentation controls that must pass SSA compliance testing.  Additionally, if JAWS scripts are required for accessibility and usability, the creation and maintenance of the scripts are the responsibility of the vendor.  NO FORMAL SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME.  Vendors that believe they can offer a technically compliant product are invited to submit information concerning their products capabilities.  Detailed responses to each of the above requirements, with substantiating documentation, are required. The responses must clearly state how their product provides the ability to meet each of the above requirements.   Simple marketing information or incomplete responses will not be considered.  Reference to vendor web sites is not considered a valid response.   Vendors responding should indicate whether their products are available on any established contractual vehicle (FSS, GWAC, etc).  Pricing data may be submitted, including that for the initial software as well as for annual maintenance.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of data received.  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information may be used in SSAâ€™s assessment of capable sources.  The government does not intend to pay for information provided.  No faxed responses.  ELECTRONIC RESPONSES ONLY PLEASE.  NOTE:  There is a size limit for e-mail:  No submission shall be greater than 5MB.  MS Word 2002 is the standard word processing software.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Emergency Management Institute (EMI), National Emergency Training Center (NETC) has an Emergency Management Higher Education Project, which seeks to develop a stand-alone, 3 credit hour 45 contact hour, semester length, classroom-based, upper division undergraduate/graduate-level college course on Catastrophe Readiness and Response.  This requirement will be set aside 100% to small business.  The NAICS code is 611430, Professional and Management Development Training, and the small business size standard is $6.5 million [average annual revenue for three preceding fiscal years].  Award of a firm-fixed-price purchase order, using simplified acquisition procedures is anticipated.  The award will be made based on Best Value to the Government, in accordance with the evaluation factors set forth herein and in the Request for Quotation (RFQ) package.  Potential offerors must request the Request for Quotation (RFQ) package in writing, no later than July 14, 2006, by sending their request to ATTN: Teresa Dingle, Contract Specialist, via email to teresa.dingle@dhs.gov.  RFQ packages will be sent to potential offerors via email only; therefore, offerors shall include a point of contact name and email address with their request for the RFQ package.  The goal of this requirement is to encourage and support the expansion of hazard, disaster and emergency management related education in colleges and universities across the United States so that in the future more emergency management and related personnel in government and the private sector will come to the job not only with a college education, but with a course of study, if not a degree, in emergency management as well.  Because emergency management is a multidisciplinary field of study, this helps contribute to the professionalization of emergency management and the expansion of emergency management knowledge and principles into other professions and disciplines as well-all of which contributes to building disaster resistant and resilient communities of tomorrow.  Toward that end, EMI, located at the NETC in Emmitsburg, Maryland, developed the Higher Education Project, the primary purpose of which is to encourage and support the development of hazard, disaster and emergency management bachelor and graduate degree programs within the United States colleges and universities.  Each Emergency Management Higher Education Project course shall be developed within the philosophical context of (1) building disaster resistant and resilient communities, and (2) seeking balance between the technocratic and the social vulnerability reduction approaches to emergency management.  Please refer to the Higher Education Project Slide Presentation at the following website address:  http://training.fema.gov/EMIweb/edu/highedbrief_course2.ppt.  A listing of the completed Emergency Management Higher Education Project courses can be found at the following website: http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/edu/highedbief_course2ppt.  Additional information concerning the Emergency Management Higher Education Project can be accessed at:  http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/edu/aem_courses.htm.
Course developers shall be able to provide evidence of holding a doctoral degree from an accredited college or university, demonstrate experience teaching hazard, disaster and/or emergency management related courses at the upper division or graduate college level at an accredited university within the past five (5) years (provide course titles, dates and copies of most relevant course syllabi), demonstrate knowledge of and background in the subject matter of “comprehensive emergency management,” demonstrate familiarity with emergency management-related literature, demonstrate background, credentials and expertise in the subject matter of catastrophe readiness and response-preferable demonstrated by the provision of a copy of a college course syllabus for an emergency management course taught by the offeror, or, by one of the proposed course development team members that relates to catastrophe readiness and response, or catastrophe-related publications, demonstrate experience with inter-disciplinary development team, and demonstrate experience of inter-collegiate development team representing more than a single college.  Catastrophes are different from disasters in kind, and not just in degree, and thinking about Katrina-like catastrophes requires a different kind of thinking, planning, and preparing than that for disasters.  After a few hundred years of disaster experience in the United States, there is still a lack of consensus on the core factors or conditions for successful catastrophe preparedness and response.  Dozens of events have each taken many hundreds of lives-accidents, earthquakes, explosions, fires, floods, hurricanes, pandemics, terrorism, and wildfires.  Hundreds more have cost lives and economic loss.  The United States is becoming more vulnerable to disasters and catastrophes, which are guaranteed to be part of our future; therefore, there needs to be more consensus.  Amongst the topics that could conceivably be covered in a college course on Catastrophe Readiness and Response are:  Definitions and Discussion of Disaster and Catastrophe; Distinctions to be made between disaster readiness and response as compared with catastrophe readiness and response; Acceptance of Catastrophe Potential as a Precondition to Serious Planning for Catastrophe; Acting on Risk Determinations-Catastrophe Worse Case Scenarios versus Unrealistic Fear and Unlikely Scenarios; Case Studies of Catastrophes-Here and Abroad; Importance of Highly Trained and Professional Emergency Management Cadre in Adequate Number; Importance of State-Level Funding Mechanisms to Develop Staff and Capabilities-Florida Example; All-Hazards versus Terrorism-Specific Approaches to Catastrophe Readiness: Boils down to which is the truer statement: The better prepared a community is for the full range of potential hazards facing a community (all hazards), the better the community will be for a terrorist event, OR, The better prepared a community is for a Weapons of Mass Destruction terrorist attack (terrorism-specific focus and dual-use funding philosophy), the better prepared the community will be for all other hazards; which is the highest priority Prevention, Reduction and Mitigation Measures or, Readiness, Preparedness and Response Measures; Horizontal and Vertical Integration-Creating a Culture of Catastrophe Readiness in a Jurisdiction or Organization; Applicability of Social Vulnerability Approach to Emergency Management Concept to Catastrophe Readiness and Response; Coordination and Cooperation versus Command and Control Modules; Risk Assessment and Risk Management-How best should scarce resources be devoted, tradeoffs between preparing for most likely versus most costly; The Emergency Management Assistance Compact-Structure, Operations, Capabilities; Regional Approaches to Readiness Capability Building as Essential; Military (Active Duty and National Guard) Roles in Catastrophe Readiness and Response-Military Support to Civil Authority; Communications Systems; Catastrophe Planning versus Disaster Planning; Catastrophe Operations and Resource Management; Leadership in Disasters/Catastrophes-Developing Leadership in Students; and Improvisation, Flexibility, Resourcefulness and Decentralized Decision Making.  The Contractor will be required to develop a work plan for this development effort, attend and participate in a course development/focus group meeting, develop a course outline/syllabus, develop draft course materials, attend a draft course review comments meeting at EMI/NETC in Emmitsburg, Maryland, develop final course materials, and attend and conduct a presentation at the Annual Higher Education Project Summer Conference at EMI/NETC, Emmitsburg, Maryland.

<DESC>Background:
The Office of Advocacy is charged with documenting business ownership statistics for various owner demographics, including minorities, women, veterans, and service-disabled veterans.  Over the years, we have conducted a variety of studies on this subject.  For example, see http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/demographic.html.

The Office of Advocacy is interested in expanding its knowledge in this area with a research project that would examine issues related to business ownership and owner demographics.  Various data sources might be used, including the Survey of Business Owners, the Current Population Survey, Statistics of Income, and others. It would also be of interest to examine barriers that might prevent these groups from starting or growing their businesses?  Why, for instance, do some groups lag behind their peers in terms of business ownership, or conversely, why are other groups more successful?  How does this affect the economic well-being of such groups? Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on July 10, 2006 and end on July 14, 2006.  No questions after July 14, 2006.  Questions MUST be emailed to the Contracting Specialist (brenda.mealer@sba.gov).  Fax or email proposals will not be accepted.  Please provide the RFQ number in the subject line of your email for questions.  NOTE:  THIS PROCUREMENT IS A 100 PERCENT SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.

<SUBJECT>B -- RESEARCH ON HUMAN CAPITAL AND BUSINESS OWNERSHIP BY DEMOGRAPHICS

<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>Background:
According to Wikipedia, human capital is defined as “a way of defining and categorizing peoples' skills and abilities as used in employment and otherwise contribute to the economy.” People improve their human capital through education and participation in the marketplace where others boost up their technological and managerial know-how. 

The drastic increase in women business ownership exemplifies women’s swelling human capital that has been the bedrock for women’s financial independence and economic prosperity. Two recent research projects highlight the importance of this topic – “The Quiet Revolution that Transformed Women’s Employment, Education, and Family” by Claudia Goldin (http://www.nber.org/papers/w11953) and Enterprising Women: 250 Years of American Business by Virginia Drachman (http://uncpress.unc.edu/books/t-7028.html). 

The proposed study must define human capital, find data or proxy to measure the stock of women’s human capital, and analyze how the growth of women human capital correlate with the growth of business ownership. Moreover, it would also compare and contrast these findings with results from other groups, such as men and minorities.

Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on July 10, 2006 and end on July 14, 2006.  No questions after July 14, 2006.

<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>Background:  The HUBZone Act of 1997, Title VI of Public Law 105-135, enacted on December 2, 1997 (111 Stat. 2592), created the HUBZone Empowerment Contracting Program (hereinafter “the HUBZone Program). 
Public Law 108-447 requires the Office of Advocacy to review the HUBZone program and provide Congress with the study by May 1, 2008.  More specifically, The Office of Advocacy is charged with the task of measuring the effectiveness of the definitions under Section 3(p)(4) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(p)(4)) for the purposes of economic impact on small business development and job creation.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) produced a report to Congress in 2002 that evaluated the HUBZone program (https://eweb1.sba.gov/hubzone/internet/general/library.cfm#2).

The Office of Advocacy seeks proposals to fulfill this task, with the understanding that the winning bidder will need to demonstrate practical knowledge of the HUBZone program.  Data will be available from the HUBZone Program (https://eweb1.sba.gov/hubzone/internet/) at the SBA in coordination with the Office of Advocacy. Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on July 10, 2006 and end on July 14, 2006.  No questions after July 14, 2006.  Questions MUST be email to the Contracting Specialist (brenda.mealer@sba.gov).  Fax or email proposals will not be accepted.  Please provide the RFQ number in the subject line of your email for questions.  NOTE:  THIS PROCUREMENT IS A 100 PERCENT SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.

<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>Purpose: With the availability of the 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances by the Federal Reserve Board this summer, the Office of Advocacy seeks projects that use the databases (for years 1987, 1993, 1998, and 2003) to increase the state of knowledge about the availability and the uses of debt and equity capital by small business, and the government’s role and policies that affect small firms. Depending on technical merit, policy relevance and costs, the Office may award more than one contract in this topic area. NOTE:  THIS PROCUREMENT IS A 100% SET A-SIDE  FOR SMALL BUSINESS.  

Availability of large nationally representative statistical databases on small business financing allows researchers to experiment innovative methodologies to test interesting hypotheses related to small business financing behaviors of lenders and borrowers. The proposal shall describe hypotheses about the availability or uses of different financing sources, over time, by small firms or by certain demographic groups of small businesses (by gender, race/ethnicity, industry, urban vs. rural or regional location) that has policy relevance. The proposal shall provide detailed explanation of the databases, the limits as well as the merits, and explain how one or more data bases will be used to test the hypothesis. 

Anyone bidding on these proposals is expected to have a previous record of research on the topic of interest as well as familiarity with the databases.  Research with policy emphasis is encouraged. The proposal could start with a review of the literature, establish a set of hypotheses to be tested, describe the model and the data to test the model and then explain the results.

Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on July 10, 2006 and end on July 14, 2006. No questions after July 14, 2006. Questions MUST be email to the Contracting Specialist (sharonbrown@sba.gov). Fax or email proposals will not be accepted.
Please provide the RFQ number in your email subject line for questions.

<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>Background:
In August 2005, the Office of Advocacy released a study on small business benefits that reached the following conclusion (http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/rs224tot.pdf): 

Employees of small businesses have access to fewer benefits than do the employees of large businesses. Small and large businesses continue to provide benefits to their employees, but at a declining rate. Companies of all sizes have reduced the availability of health insurance to their employees due to the increasing cost associated with benefits in recent years. Access to retirement benefits is more prevalent among large firms than among small firms.

The Office of Advocacy has conducted many studies on this topic (http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/wages.html). Small firms continue to be squeezed by higher health insurance premiums, as evidenced by annual surveys from the Kaiser Family Foundation (http://www.kff.org/insurance/7315/index.cfm), and small business owners continue to cite the cost and availability of insurance as the single most important problem that they face in the monthly Small Business Economic Trends published by the National Federation of Independent Business (for more information, see http://www.nfib.com/page/researchFoundation). Firms have reacted to rising health care costs in different ways.  Many are beginning to offer high deductible health plans (HDHP) coupled with a health savings account (HSA) as a method of using consumer-driven options to control costs.  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, more large firms than small firms are the early adopters of these HDHP’s and HSA's, which were created by the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. Because these types of plans are relatively new, data are just beginning to emerge on their usage.  (Another source of information on these and other plans is America’s Health Insurance Plans, which can be found at http://www.ahipresearch.org.) 

In terms of retirement plans, small firms are more likely to have defined-contribution versus defined-benefit plans. Yet, rising health care costs can mean that some small business owners must choose between providing their workers with health insurance or making contributions to their employee’s retirement savings plan. Providing such benefits can be essential to attracting qualified workers, especially as these smaller entities compete for labor with their larger counterparts.

The Office of Advocacy seeks additional research in the area of small business benefits. Proposals could focus on health care, retirement, or some other form of employee compensation or benefit, and they should focus on data sources that contain firm-size information. (This is preferable to establishment-size data.)  Possible data sources include, but are not limited to: the Current Population Survey, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, and the Survey of Income and Program Participation. Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on July 10, 2006 and end on July 14, 2006.     No questions after July 14, 2006.     Questions MUST be email to the Contracting Specialist (sharonbrown@sba.gov). Fax or email proposals will not be accepted. Please provide the RFQ number in the subject line of your email for questions.  NOTE: THIS PROCUREMENT IS A 100 PERCENT SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The QDR serves as a driving force towards transformation within the MHS.  An initial step in transforming is the analysis of existing business operations for inefficiencies, duplications and gaps.  This effort requires that business owners, leaders a nd information technology experts, readily understand business functions and use a common modeling language to communicate.  A user-oriented, simple and intuitive business operations modeling methodology and tool is needed to visualize and document the wha t, when, who, where and which of current and future state business processes.  The result of successful business operations design will lead to the development of more precise requirements, which systems engineering can use to design and develop informatio n technology solutions that better support the users. Since transformation will be on-going effort, the MHS OT and IMT&R intends to establish a trained, self-sufficient Business Process Reengineering (BPR) Team who will work with business owners to model b usiness processes impacted by the QDR initiatives.  The MHS-OT and IMT&R intends to purchase eleven (11) licenses, to include intellectual property rights of the methodology, of intuitive, rule-based, purpose-based business operations modeling methodology and tool.   The BPR Team of five (5) individuals will undergo training (in two sessions located in Washington DC geographical area) on the business operations modeling methodology and use of the tool.

<DESC>The QDR serves as a driving force towards transformation within the MHS.  An initial step in transforming is the analysis of existing business operations for inefficiencies, duplications and gaps.  This effort requires that business owners, leaders a nd information technology experts, readily understand business functions and use a common modeling language to communicate.  A user-oriented, simple and intuitive business operations modeling methodology and tool is needed to visualize and document the wha t, when, who, where and which of current and future state business processes.  The result of successful business operations design will lead to the development of more precise requirements, which systems engineering can use to design and develop informatio n technology solutions that better support the users.Since transformation will be on-going effort, the MHS OT and IMT&R intends to establish a trained, self-sufficient Business Process Reengineering (BPR) Team who will work with business owners to model bu siness processes impacted by the QDR initiatives. The MHS-OT and IMT&R intends to purchase eleven (11) licenses, to include intellectual property rights of the methodology, of intuitive, rule-based, purpose-based business operations modeling methodology an d tool.   The BPR Team of five (5) individuals will undergo training (in two sessions located in Washington DC geographical area) on the business operations modeling methodology and use of the tool. The MHS-OT and IMT&R intends to conduct two (2) simultane ous, pilot projects in applying the modeling methodology on two (2) business processes.  These projects should include all activities required to successfully model a given business operation (e.g. set up, documentation collection and review, pre-populatio n of the model, modeling activities with business owners, documentation of outputs, wrap up and evaluation).   Mentoring and facilitation by the vendor is expected for these two projects.  The intent is to train members of the BPR Team who will actively pa rticipate in applying the methodology, so that they can lead future BPR efforts with gradual decreasing dependence on vendor support.

<DESC>Solicitation number FA8101-05-R-0011 is expected to be released sometime between 21 Nov and 9 Dec 05.  The solicitation will be posted in its entirety to Fed Biz Ops.  The previous synopsis did not include the following information and is hereby amended to incorporate this information:

All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the Agency.  The solicitation/procurement data is approved for release ONLY to U.S. DoD contractors who are registered with the Department of Commerce Central Contractor Registration (CCR) site.

All interested parties are requested to respond with comments to the Contracting Officer, Michelle Shaw, at michelle.shaw@tinker.af.mil.  Phone calls are discouraged.



This office is currently in the early acquisition planning process for the follow-on contract for the Base Supply Function contract.  There are several issues that the Government is considering and the purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to get comments from industry.  
First:  The Government believes that the NAICS code 561210, Facilities Support Services, adequately describes the scope of work to be performed.  The last contract was SIC code 8744, Facilities Support Management Service, and FSC Z999 Miscellaneous.  
Second:  The current contract was awarded through full and open competition procedures after a OMB Circular A-76 Cost Study and was not set-aside for small business.  The Government would like to consider some kind of small business set-aside and is interested to see what small business respondents are seriously interested in this acquisition.  Partnering and joint ventures are encouraged.
Third:  The Government would like to utilize a 10 year period of performance for the follow-on contract but is not sure that industry is able to have pricing information to account for costs during the latter years of the contract.  The Government will consider some type of economic price adjustment if industry can support the rationale or other recommended length for the period of performance.  The estimated value of the contract for the 10 year period would be $36M.
The solicitation number will be FA8101-05-R-0011.  There is no expected release date for the solicitation at this time.  The Contracting Officer may post a draft Performance Work Statement for comment on FedBizOpps.   The synopsis and formal Request For Proposal will be posted on FedBizOpps.  The information gathered as a result from this Request For Information may be considered market research.  It would be most helpful to provide your comments by COB 24 Mar 2005, however, comments to this RFI will be accepted until release of the formal RFP.
All interested parties are requested to respond with comments to the Contracting Officer, Michelle Shaw, at michelle.shaw@tinker.af.mil.  Phone calls are discouraged.

<DESC>This requirement is restricted for set-aside as a national 8(a) competitive acquisition.  

The solicitation for the Wright-Patterson AFB (WPAFB) SABER contract will be released soon.  It is tentatively scheduled for release on or about 30 Jun 06.  Proposal will be due 30 days after the proposal release date.  The point of contact for this effort is Kevin D. Parks, kevin.parks@wpafb.af.mil, (937) 522-4613.  This acquisition is for a broad range of maintenance, repair, and minor construction work on real property at Wright-Patterson AFB and its associated sites. 

The Simplified Acquisition of Base Engineering Requirements (SABER) Contract, at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, will be a firm-fixed price indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type for estimating and construction efforts.  NAICS Code 236220, Size Standard $28.5 million.  The period of performance includes a base year, FY07, plus 4 option years, FY08 through FY11.  The estimated contract value is $60M ($12M * 5 years).  The guaranteed contract minimum will be $100,000 for the base year and $100,000 for each option year.  Traditionally, there have been upwards of 100 active SABER delivery orders at varying stages of completion at any given time.  However, this historical data does not necessarily reflect future SABER requirements.  

The successful contractor will be required to furnish all materials, equipment, and personnel necessary to design, manage, and accomplish individual projects under the purview of Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. During the contract period, Base Civil Engineering will identify construction tasks and the Contracting Office will negotiate and issue individual delivery orders to the Contractor to complete them. Projects will be in support of real property maintenance, repair, alteration, and/or new construction. The work involved may include, but is not limited to minimal design (35%), carpentry, concrete, excavating, interior, electrical, steam fitting, plumbing, sheet metal, painting, demolition, masonry, and welding.  Statement of Work (SOW) is attached.

<DESC>This is issued to correct the Issue Date to 10 July 2006. THIS IS A SOLICITATION NOTICE.  In accordance with the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) statute, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will issue a RFP for the Tire Privatization Initiative on Friday, June 30, 2006.

The purpose of this RFP is to solicit proposals for supply chain management of vehicle (Land) tires for the Department of Defense. Under the Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990, 10 U.S.C. 2687 note, the BRAC Commission’s recommendation to privatize the supply, storage and distribution for tires (Federal Supply Classes 2610, 2620, and 2630) became law on November 8, 2005.  This recommendation is intended to create a more responsive supply support to user organizations and deployment, and the sustainment of forces when deployed worldwide.  Privatization enables the Department to take advantage of the latest technologies, expertise, and business practices, which translate into improved support to customers at less cost.  This recommendation disestablishes the wholesale supply, storage, and distribution functions for all vehicle tires used by the Department of Defense, retaining only the supply contracting function. The Department will privatize these functions and will rely on private industry for the performance of supply, storage, and distribution of these tires.  By doing so, the Department can divest itself of inventories and can eliminate infrastructure and personnel associated with these functions.  

The resultant contract will be awarded on an all or none basis and is being solicited as unrestricted. This acquisition will use a Long-Term Firm Fixed Price Requirements contract, five year base period with one-five year option period, with Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) provisions. The EPA provision is limited to a maximum increase of 7% per year. IAW FAR 2.101 the contracting officer has determined the tires to be purchased under this solicitation meet the definition of commercial items and will be solicited under FAR Part 12. This solicitation includes an Add/Delete clause which allows the Government to adapt the resultant contract to the changing needs of the military customer.   

The solicitation will be available at the following web site:
http://www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/tiremgmt   

Schedule: This solicitation will issued on 10 July 2006. The Solicitation closing date will be 18 August 06.

WE DO NOT POST OUR SOLICITATIONS ON THE FEDBIZOPPS, ONLY THE NOTICES. THE SOLICITATION WILL ONLY BE POSTED AT THE WEBSITE LISTED IN THIS NOTICE.

Questions from the June 21, 2006, walk-through/conference


June 6, 2006 (Questions)

1.      Question - Related to Stage I:  (3) Lead Designer Portfolio – please explain intent of last sentence which states:  “Where there is a duplication with criteria (1) Performance on Design, the Lead Designer shall address his or her participation in the Project”.

Response - See answer to #3.  If the sample projects submitted under the firms past experience are also done by the lead Designer clearly state the lead Designers duties, role and responsibilities on each project. If the projects submitted under the lead designer’s portfolio are the same as in the firm’s portfolio then just the Lead Designer role needs to be defined, duplicating the entire portfolio is not necessary.  You may submit as many projects as allowed (5 projects for the firms experience and 3 for the Lead Designer).
 
2.      Question - Related to Stage I:  (3) Lead Designer Portfolio – please explain intent of adding the words “and rehabilitation” to end of second sentence.  Does it mean rehabilitation or renovation of building without historic description?

Response - There is no special intent or meaning, a variety of work showing restoration, conservation, rehabilitation would be the best.
 
3.      Question - If the Lead Designer is a principal of the firm and solely responsible for the design of a project, may that project be listed in both (1) Past Performance on Design and (3) Lead Designer’s Portfolio?  If listed in both sections will scoring points be down graded?

Response - See answer to #1. Yes you may duplicate projects but the principal must have truly acted as the Lead Designer.  

4.      Question - If a project is a new building that demonstrates design skill in blending new construction with adjacent historic structures, will scoring points be down graded because project is not renovation?

Response - All design talent and creativity will be evaluated, but it is easier to demonstrate design talent using projects of similar scope and complexity to this project.  We can not tell you what projects to submit but showing projects of similar or larger size and complexity shows the widest variety of design talent.    

5.      Question - If a project is a new U.S. Courthouse in a historic district that demonstrates skill in meeting GSA P-100, PBS Standards, ABAAS, understanding of court design standards and sensitive design relationships with adjacent historic structures, will scoring points be down graded because project is not renovation? 

Response - See above discussion.

June 5, 2006 (Questions)

1.      Question - Under Stage I description, please explain intent where it says to include “credentials of historic preservation specialist per requirements . . . .” 

Response - We would like to know who will be acting as the historic preservation specialist.  If that role is being filled by the Lead designer then state that.
  
2.      Question - Does the Stage I Design Firm and/or the Lead Designer need to be a GSA approved Historic Preservation Specialist or is it satisfactory for the Stage II Team to have those Specialists? 
Response - No, the Design Firm nor the Lead Designer are not required to be the historic preservation specialist, but the sample projects for both those entities are going to be evaluated on historic renovation design talent.  Therefore the historic preservation specialist would either be the lead designer or work for the Design Firm.  This expertise can be a consultant added to the team in Phase II, but the sample project for Phase I need to have been done by the Lead Designer and Design firm.  Project of consultants can not be submitted in phase I unless they are projects that the Lead Designer and Design Firm acted in those same roles on the projects.    
  
3.      Question - If the Design Firm and/or Lead Designer have completed significant historic preservation projects including buildings and landscapes on the National Register, doe they need to have GSA “proof of competency” prior to submission for referenced project and/or without such credentials, will qualifications be downgraded by selection panel? 

Response - The sample design projects is the proof competency. Again you select the 8 total (5 for the firm and 3 for the Lead Designer) that best demonstrates your firms design ability.
  
4.     Question - Has the Preservation Planning Report been completed?  Is it available for review?  Who was the author?
 
Response - Do not know if this is done, but it is not relevant to the selection process.  Phase I evaluation is limited to past performance on other projects and will not consider knowledge or premature solutions for this project, please do not attempt to present them.
  
5.      Question - Will there be a pre-submission conference/meeting? 

Response - No, a pre-submission conference/meeting is not necessary.
  
June 22, 2006 (Questions)

Question - PLEASE VERIFY THIS STATEMENT AS WRITTEN IN THE FEDBIZOPPS 
PRESOLICITATION CONCERNING THE KINNEARY COURTHOUSE:

<DESC>26 June 2006 Updated Synopsis

This procurement (N44255-04-R-9102) is being issued UNRESTRICTED under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 236210.  The corresponding SBA size standard is $28.5 Million.  The estimated cost range for this solicitation is over $100,000,000.  This procurement will result in a firm fixed price contract.  

Only U.S. citizens may participate in this solicitation and resultant contract.

This project will construct an 180,000-ft2 multi-level (approximately 270 ft by 360 ft), below-grade, earth covered, internal and external blast hardened, heavily reinforced concrete structure.  Special features of the facility include:  Two tunnels (approximately 400 ft long, 20 ft wide, and 16 ft tall) to provide heavy vehicle access to and from the below-grade levels; above ground mechanical and production support buildings; power-operated physical security and blast-resistant doors; (7) overhead bridge cranes (2 ton capacity), (3) elevators, lightning protection system, grounding system, emergency air purge system, and multiple independent HVAC systems (approximately 11).  This project will also provide a new observation tower, utilities, and other site improvements.  The existing perimeter fence, and roads will be expanded to encompass the new facility.  The anticipated contract duration is approximately 1235 calendar days.  The exact duration will be stipulated in the solicitation.  

Prequalification Update:

Prequalifying of Sources in accordance with DFARS 236.272 is mandatory for prime contractors.  The purpose of Prequalifying firms is to develop a list of Qualified Firms who possess the proven competence to perform the construction of MCON P-973.  No pricing will be requested during prequalifications however firms must demonstrate the capability of bonding over $100,000,000.  Only firms who participate in the Prequalification of Sources and are determined to possess the necessary competencies will be able to participate in Part II, the Construction Request for Proposals (RFP).

Naval Facilities Engineering Command Northwest (NAVFAC NW) has determined to reopen pre-qualification process for MCON P-973 Limited Area Processing & Storage Complex for a period of four weeks commencing 13 June 2006.

Initial Pre-Qualification submissions were submitted 15 September 2005.

The determination to reopen pre-qualification is a collective consideration of several facts/findings including the time lapse from initial pre-qualification submission, the anticipated Request for Proposal dates, and the significance and magnitude of the project.

Existing pre-qualification offerors need to submit a statement validating that teaming arrangements and major subcontractor commitments are current as of July 2006.  The statement of validation and any updates need to be submitted to mark.snell@navy.mil by 14 July 2006.  Any pre-qualification submissions from new offerors for LAPSC shall be held to the same submission requirements and evaluation criteria as the initial submission (15 September 2005). Any submissions from new offerors are also due 14 July 2006.  The prequalification RFP (submission requirements and evaluation criteria) may be requested by e-mailing mark.snell@navy.mil. 

The front end of the Construction Request for Proposal is anticipated to be issued 11 October 2006.  (Plans and Specs are anticipated to be issued 14 November 2006) Anticipated Construction Contract Award is April 2007.

The Government reserves the right to reject any or all prequalification submissions at any time.  FIRMS ARE ADVISED THAT THE DETERMINATION OF PREQUALIFIED FIRMS MAY BE MADE WITHOUT COMMUNICATIONS OR CLARIFICATIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PREQUALIFICATION SUBMISSION RECEIVED.  Therefore, prequalification submissions should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.  Firms should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify or revise their qualifications.  FIRMS SUBMITTING PREQUALFICATIONS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED.  

Once the prequalification procedures are conducted, qualified Prime Construction Contractors for LAPSC will be posted to the Navy’ s www.esol.navfac.navy.mil website for subcontracting opportunities.  All prime contractors/subcontractors/suppliers are advised to register and periodically review www.esol.navfac.navy.mil for any changes/additions.  There will be no site visits during prequalifications.  It is anticipated that a pre-proposal conference will be scheduled after prequalifications.  

The closing date for receipt of updates or new prequalification submissions is 14 July 2006.  

Part II Construction RFP will consist of Source Selection (negotiated) best value procedures, as it has been determined in accordance with FAR 6.401 to be the most appropriate method of contracting for the subject project.  Only those firms found to possess the necessary competencies as stipulated in the Prequalification will participate in Part II, the Construction RFP.  It is anticipated that this procurement will be evaluated on the following factors:  1) Technical (Past Performance; Safety); 2) Management (Key Personnel; Management Organization; Small Business Utilization); and 3) Price.  Proposals will be evaluated to determine which offer provides the best value to the Government.    

The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.  Offerors should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  OFFERORS SUBMITTING TECHNICAL AND PRICE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED.  

Anticipated construction contract award date is April 2007.

Full plans and specifications will be issued only during Part II, Construction RFP.    Subcontractors/Suppliers shall be notified of plans and specifications availability via ESOL only.  It is each firm’s responsibility to periodically check www.esol.navfac.navy.mil for the specific date that plans and specification shall be made available.  It is anticipated that offerors shall be charged for plans and specifications.

<DESC>The Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) Joint Program Office (JPO) GPS III Control Segment (OCX) intends to award a sole-source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) modification as a revision to the PRDA contract FA8807-05-C-0013. This modification will add nine months of Period of Performance. This OCX PRDA contract was awarded in July 2005 to increase the U.S. Air Force’s understanding of current technology innovations and capabilities in the area of satellite control segment software & hardware architecture. An additional objective of this OCX PRDA contract was to have the contractor investigate and develop innovative OCX architecture that meets the OCX SS-CS-800 requirements. Under this contract revision, the contractor is to perform risk reduction efforts as described in OCX Risk Reduction (PRDA extension #2) SOO, not to exclude approaches to support an accelerated GPS IIIA space vehicle launch, GPS ground control and space vehicle synchronization, and a smooth low risk operational transition from AEP to OCX. Some prototyping and demonstrations may be of value to the government. Because this action is a continuation of the PRDA contract’s risk reduction activities, this contractor is considered the most capable to provide the follow-on OCX risk reduction activities without the Government incurring substantial duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through competition and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements (10 USC 2304(c)(1)).  
      
The OCX Program Office is performing a market survey to determine if there are other interested and qualified contractors having the capability to perform risk reduction not to exclude accelerated GPS IIIA space vehicle launch, GPS Ground Control and Space Vehicle Synchronization, and a smooth low risk operational transition from AEP to OCX. To that extent, the GPS OCX program continues to update documents for current and future OCX related contracts, including Draft OCX RFP documents, Phase A, and PRDA extension #2 SOO's. They are being posted on the GPS program library. Access to the library may be requested by contacting Capt. Chad Searle at chad.searle@losangeles.af.mil.

Interested contractors other than the contractor above and those identified in synopsis reference numbers 06-59 and 06-60 are invited to submit a Statement Of Capability (SOC) addressing the ability to satisfy the above requirements to SMC/GPK, Attn: Natalie Tunnell, 483 North, Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808.  All responses are due no later than 07 July 2006 and must conform to 8.5 x 11-inch pages, with font no smaller than 12-point, with a maximum of 20 pages.  The statement of capability must include the following information:  1) Company name, mailing address, points of contact, and telephone numbers; 2) Business size classification (large, small, or other); 3) Experience in the GPS ground control segment or similar systems; 4) Ability to satisfy the government’s requirements; Oral communications are not acceptable. All responsible sources may submit a SOC, which will be considered. Any information submitted in response to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information or reimburse expenses incurred by parties for responses to this synopsis.

<RESPDATE>080406
<CONTACT>Phyllis Townsley, 405-954-7816
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement for engineering, computer, and administrative support services in support of power, navigational aids, communications, surveillance, and weather systems.  The requirement is predominantly for hardware and software engineering services involved in the acquisition, restoration, maintenance, and modification of ground-based NAS equipment throughout the United States and some overseas sites.  Contractor management and personnel will be based at the MMAC in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  Requirements are defined further in a Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The current version of the PWS is provided as a separate document under this Announcement/Screening Information Request No. 1 (SIR1).  Interested parties are also encouraged to visit the MMAC Home Page. Offers will be evaluated and contract award made on the basis of "Best Value to the FAA."  A Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) type contract is anticipated for this acquisition.  The contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base year with four (4) 1-year options to be exercised at the sole discretion of the FAA. This requirement is offered to qualified, responsive, small business concerns through use of a "3-Tier" CASCADING ORDER OF PREFERENCE to determine the extent of eligible potential offerors.  Offers will be considered beginning with evaluation of Tier 1 and following with evaluations of Tiers 2 and 3, as necessary.  Tier 1 is relegated to screening of potential offerors from among Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business (SEDB)/8(a) concerns limited to Area VI (AR, LA, NM, CO, OK, and TX).  Tier 2, if necessary, will consider nation-wide SEDB/8(a) firms.  Tier 3, if necessary, will consider nation-wide small business concerns.   The "3-Tier" process not only involves a determination of eligibility of the potential offerors at each tier, but also the number of eligible offerors from which the FAA can determine sufficient potential exists for adequate competition.  The existence of potential for adequate competition is defined as identification of at least six (6) competitive offerors from qualified, responsible business concerns at the tier under consideration from which it is anticipated that fair market prices can be obtained. If at least six (6) potential competitive offerors cannot be identified at Tier 1, then Tier 2 offerors will be considered.  If at least six (6) potential competitive offerors cannot be identified from both Tier 1 and Tier 2, Tier 3 offerors will be considered.   If a determination as to the potential for adequate competition cannot be made from Tiers 1 through 3, the FAA reserves the right to award a contract based on full and open competition.  Potential offeror(s) identified as qualified from screenings associated with Tiers 1 through 3 will be included when considering full and open competition.  The requirement will be re-announced on the FAA's website.   For purposes of this requirement, a Small Business is defined as follows: 1) Classified as a small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541330, Engineering Services (Aerospace Equipment) - $25/million.   2) An eligible SEDB/8(a) small business concern expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the 8(a) program and which meets such criteria at the time of submission of the offer.   Should a SEDB/8(a) vendor propose a teaming arrangement, the term "vendor" applies to the prime contractor.   For those vendors contemplating entering into a joint venture please reference SBA website at http://www.sba.gov/ca/santa/sa_joint-venture_html.html.  While the FAA will be the approving authority in lieu of the SBA for any proposed joint ventures for this undertaking, the SBA standards for approving joint ventures will be employed.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE.  The Solicitation Number for this announcement is N62467-06-R-5764.  ROICC Gulf Coast, solicits for Capability Statements from all qualified and interested parties with a priority on: 8(a) firms, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, and HubZone small business firms, to participate in a single phase solicitation for Repairs to Bachelor Quarters, Bldg. #313, Naval Construction Battalion Center, Gulfport MS.  The 2002 NAICS Code for the proposed acquisition is 238140, Masonry Contractors, and the small business size standard is $13 Million.  The Federal Supply Code is Z169, Maintenance/Repair/Alterations of Other Residential Buildings.  Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 25 percent of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees.  The Government will use responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT market survey to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  A decision will be made to negotiate a sole source procurement with an 8(a) contractor, issue this solicitation as a competitive Service Disabled Veteran Owned or HubZone Small Business contract, or to issue an unrestricted solicitation, inviting full and open competition.  The proposed solicitation will be formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the construction selection procedures of FAR 36. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merits and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.  

The proposed construction project will primarily consist of masonry repairs to a three-story BEQ.  The work will include removal of 8”x 8” face brick at all stairwells, louver towers, and exterior columns and replace with either salvaged or new 8”x8” brick.  The estimated cost of this acquisition is between $300,000 and $350,000.  

The Government invites contractors with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements to submit Capability Statements consisting of appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references anticipated to be five to ten pages, following the set format.  Respondents must include references and a capability statement for at least two completed projects within the last three years that are similar to the construction work and within the same dollar value magnitude (adjusted for inflation) of this notice.   Each reference shall include the company name and title, telephone number, and point of contact.  Provide evidence of sufficient available bonding capacity with the name of bonding company, telephone number, and point of contact.  Indicate whether your firm was the prime contractor or subcontractor on other similar projects. The capability statements for each project should be numbered consistent with the below requirements followed by supporting documentation.  Offerors need to provide a list of projects by contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and evidence of the following specific capabilities: 

1.	Recent and relevant federal government construction experience within the last 3 calendar years, for projects of similar size, scope, and complexity to the project proposed above, i.e. masonry repairs on multi-story buildings.

2.	If proposing to use a masonry subcontractor, provide the same information as required for Item 1 for the proposed subcontractor.

3.	If proposing to use a subcontractor (Item 2) describe in detail how you propose to meet the FAR requirement that 25% of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, be performed with your own employees.

4.	 This area has been designated as a Critical Housing Area with very limited lodging accommodations available.  If proposing to use a non-local labor force, describe your plan for housing.

5.	Provide proof of SBA certification for either 8a or HubZone status. 

The Capabilities Statement for this sources sought is not expected to be a proposal, but rather short statements regarding the company’s ability to demonstrate existing-or-developed expertise and experience in relation to the area specified herein.  Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the Capabilities statement. Submission of Capabilities statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Navy in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities. This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. After completing its analysis, the Government will determine whether to limit competition among 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran, or HubZone small business firms or to proceed with issuing an unrestricted solicitation, inviting full and open competition. Offers that do not meet all requirements or submit within the allotted time will not be considered.  Electronic submissions will be accepted.  The responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT market survey may be e-mailed to Charlene Kreeger at Charlene.kreeger@navy.mil or mailed to ROICC Gulf Coast, 5302 6th Street, NCBC Gulfport MS 39501, Attn:  Charlene Kreeger.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis (SSS) only. There is no solicitation available. This request is for planning purposes only, and it does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, or a Request for Quotes. It is not an indication the government will contract for the services contained in this SSS. The government shall not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this SSS.

Similar information has previously been sought under FedBizOpps announcements concerning: Draft RFP for PATE; sources sought synopses under the project names: Specialized Scientific, Engineering and Laboratory Management, Services and Support (SSELMSS), Specialty Network Laboratory Capability (SNLC), Materials Technology Specialized Program Support II (MTSPII), and Materials Technology Specialized Program Support (MTSPS). 

This notice has recently been posted under NAICS code 541990, and that is the NAICS code that will be used for any acquisition resulting from this announcement.  Although a limited and small amount of R&D may be pursued under PATE, NAICS code 541710 is only being used for this posting to enable wider publication of the PATE project. 

In an effort to determine if this acquisition is suitable for small businesses, the US Air Force is seeking information specifically from small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) small business, woman-owned small business, HUBZone small business and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns only that have a Top Secret facility security clearance.  Capability packages submitted by interested small business entities, small business joint ventures, or teaming arrangements will be reviewed to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy.

PATE requirements are listed in parts I and II that follow:

I.  The PATE support services involve: in-house operation and management of specific laboratory functions at a Government facility; laboratory data trend analysis and reporting; nuclear engineering analysis and particle transport analysis; chemical engineering and related disciplines; inorganic, organic, analytical, physical and biological chemistry; molecular biology; microbial biology; virology; immunology; biological engineering; mechanical engineering and related disciplines; aerobiological modeling; and meteorology.  

II. The PATE requirements will also require a contractor to maintain industry awareness of cutting-edge and/or specialized laboratory and technological services.  Additionally, a significant subcontracting opportunity for these services, as the requirements and sources are identified and needed, is anticipated.  These subcontracting opportunities would include: molecular biology to include real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR); genetic sequencing and micro-array technologies; microbial culture; immunology to include protein screening and mass spectroscopy technologies (including MSnth technologies); separation of biological materials of interest from complex sample matrices; meteorological support to include models of transport and diffusion processes; assay protocol/trouble shooting; enhancement of existing laboratory protocols; biochemical, chemical, microbiological, and/or immunological analyses; aerobiological modeling enhancement or modification to database platforms; and field test support and general sampler engineering development and design.  End Part II.

Although a 50% limitation on subcontracting (FAR 52.219-14) would normally apply for the significant PATE subcontracting opportunities (paragraph II above), a waiver of this contract clause applying to the subcontracting of cutting-edge and/or specialized laboratory and technological services will be considered in order to enable an otherwise qualified small business to participate in this acquisition. 

Firms with a Top Secret facility clearance that respond to this announcement should express their experience in providing PATE-type services and their capability in providing the following minimum types of qualified, Top Secret-cleared resources for PATE:

1.  Any three personnel from two or more of the following four types of qualifications:
(i) molecular biology
(ii) microbiology
(iii) immunology or protein chemistry
(iv) biochemistry

2.  Any one person from any of the following two types of qualifications:
(i) nuclear engineering or nuclear physics
(ii) inorganic, organic, analytical, physical chemistry or chemical engineering

3.  Any one person from any of the following two types of qualifications:
(i) mechanical engineering and related discipline
(ii) meteorological sciences

4.  An additional person from any of the above listed eight qualifications.

Respondents should include their assigned Commercial And Government Entity (CAGE) code.  Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort.  Due to the nature of this potential effort, no foreign country sources will be considered.  Include your Government assigned company Facility Code (also called CAGE code) for the applicable facility and storage facility that would safeguard any classified data supplied by the Government. 

Prospective firms are encouraged to submit a capability summary (maximum length 10 pages) describing the firm’s expertise and related experiences in meeting the requirements stated above to the contract specialist:  daniel.gill@patrick.af.mil.  A Top Secret facility clearance is required.

<DESC>The New York District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (District) is in the process of developing the execution plan for the beach renourishment at Long Branch, NJ.  The project will include the dredging of sand from a designated borrow area, the Sea Br ight Borrow Area, off shore of Sandy Hook, NJ.  The Sea Bright Borrow Area is located approximately five miles off shore at a mean water depth of 75 feet.  The material (beach fill) will be placed north of Lake Takanassee.  There will be 500,000 CY to 1,00 0,000 CY taken from the Sea Bright Borrow Area for the Long Branch Beach renourishment project.  The Contractor will conform to all local, state, and federal laws while carrying out the dredging of the material from the borrow area and subsequent beach fil l placement.  The Contractor is required to conduct Sea Turtle and Whale monitoring during the period of June 15th through November 15th.  The Contractor cannot place beach fill material during the period of March 15th through September 15th due to Piper P lovers nesting on the beach.  There are additional restrictions to beach fill placement during the period of May 1st to November 1st.   These restrictions are to avoid disturbance to bird nesting from Sea Beach Amaranth and Turns.  The Contractor shall pre pare and submit a site-specific magnetometer work plan and the safety and health plan to the government for approval prior to mobilization.  The work plan shall contain an UXO (unexploded ordnance) operation plan detailing the Contractors proposed methodol ogy to complete the magnetometer search and ordnance removal procedures.  Prior to the commencement of work, the Contractor shall notify the 1st Coast Guard District, Aids to Navigation Officer, of his proposed operations, including location and duration o f operations and request that the information be published in a Notice to Mariners. This notification must be given at least three (3) weeks in advance so that it appears in the Notice to Mariners at least one week prior to the commencement of the beac h renourishment operation. The Contractor shall also coordinate all dredging and transportation activities with U.S. Coast Guard Activities New Jersey, Vessel Traffic Service Branch. The Contractor will mark work areas with buoys as coordinated with the US CG.

Your responses to the following questions will provide valuable information for future discussions with these agencies.  13)	Do you have any information (i.e., engine manufacturer statements on emissions characteristics, etc.) or data (engine model, manufacturer, year, etc.) available on the emission levels from your dredge, tugboat, scow, etc.? If so, would you please provi de us this information with your response along with a point of contact and phone number? 14)	Have you had experience with the use of alternative fuels, admixtures, or retrofitting of equipment to reduce emission levels? If so please identify the project, the nature of the alteration to the previous operating pattern. Would you please provide u s with a point of contact and phone number so that more detailed information could gathered at a future date?  15)	Do you believe that the use of an electric powered dredge is a viable alternate to a diesel powered hopper, clamshell and excavator dredge? Do you own or have available for your use an electric dredge? Would you provide us the landside infrastructure r equirements to support your electric dredge(s)? 16)	Would you be willing to purchase emission reduction credits (ERC) in lieu of using alternative fuels, admixtures, or retrofitting equipment? Have you ever purchased such credits? If so please identify the project, a point of contact and phone number.  17)	Would you be willing to be part of a field trial for emission level monitoring?

<SUBJECT>Z -- BASE SUPPLY FUNCTION (REQUEST FOR INFORMATION)
<DESC>This office is currently in the early acquisition planning process for the follow-on contract for the Base Supply Function contract.  There are several issues that the Government is considering and the purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to get comments from industry.  
First:  The Government believes that the NAICS code 561210, Facilities Support Services, adequately describes the scope of work to be performed.  The last contract was SIC code 8744, Facilities Support Management Service, and FSC Z999 Miscellaneous.  
Second:  The current contract was awarded through full and open competition procedures after a OMB Circular A-76 Cost Study and was not set-aside for small business.  The Government would like to consider some kind of small business set-aside and is interested to see what small business respondents are seriously interested in this acquisition.  Partnering and joint ventures are encouraged.
Third:  The Government would like to utilize a 10 year period of performance for the follow-on contract but is not sure that industry is able to have pricing information to account for costs during the latter years of the contract.  The Government will consider some type of economic price adjustment if industry can support the rationale or other recommended length for the period of performance.  The estimated value of the contract for the 10 year period would be $36M.
The solicitation number will be FA8101-05-R-0011.  There is no expected release date for the solicitation at this time.  The Contracting Officer may post a draft Performance Work Statement for comment on FedBizOpps.   The synopsis and formal Request For Proposal will be posted on FedBizOpps.  The information gathered as a result from this Request For Information may be considered market research.  It would be most helpful to provide your comments by COB 24 Mar 2005, however, comments to this RFI will be accepted until release of the formal RFP.
All interested parties are requested to respond with comments to the Contracting Officer, Michelle Shaw, at michelle.shaw@tinker.af.mil.  Phone calls are discouraged.

<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Information (RFI):  Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
<DESC>The NHLBI, in cooperation with the FDA under its Critical Path Initiative (http://www.fda.gov/oc/initiatives/criticalpath/), is soliciting comments from pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic investigators, biotechnology firms, and other health research-oriented organizations, regarding the value, design, feasibility, and operation of a possible study of subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) intended to (1) identify pathogenetically homogeneous subpopulations of subjects with COPD on the basis of their genomic, genetic, biomarker, and radiographic characteristics; and (2) identify and validate intermediate outcome measures for use in future clinical trials. 

Background

COPD affects approximately 15 million people in the U.S. and is now the fourth leading cause of death.  There is no cure, and treatments are only moderately effective at relieving symptoms.  Many novel treatments have been proposed, based on advances in pathogenetic research, but few clinical trials are currently being performed.  This is mainly due to the large sample size and long duration required for clinical trials in COPD as a result of:  (1) the heterogeneity of the disease, possibly indicating the operation of different pathogenetic mechanisms in different patients; and (2) the absence of validated and responsive outcome measures that can be evaluated in studies of reasonable size and duration.  

To overcome these barriers, the NHLBI is considering a plan to obtain phenotypic data appropriate for the identification of subpopulations and intermediate outcome measures in COPD.  It is anticipated that this research program will involve analysis of the following data from several thousand subjects with COPD: (1) baseline characterization by historical, clinical, physiological, biomarker, CT radiological, genomic, and genetic examinations; (2) follow-up measurements of CT images, biomarkers, and gene expression profiles, possibly at 1 year after enrollment; and (3) long-term follow-up over 3 or more years using conventional measures of COPD progression (rate of decline in FEV1, exacerbation frequency, decline in quality of life, and mortality).  Putative subpopulations will be identified by cross-sectional analysis of the radiological, biomarker, genomic, and genetic data obtained at baseline.  Measures with spontaneous changes over 1 year that correlate with long-term outcomes will be identified as possible intermediate outcome measures.  Data collected through this program will be made available to qualified investigators for additional analyses in accordance with the NHLBI Policy for Distribution of Data (see http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/deca/policy_new.htm).

Information Requested

The NHLBI and FDA solicit general comments regarding the significance, approach, and utility of the research study described above.  Specifically, we seek answers to any or all of the following questions:

1.	Would a study similar to that described above yield information that would be of significant value for improving the efficiency of future clinical trials in COPD?  What study design would be optimal?  What sample size is needed?

2.	Would it be feasible to obtain data for this study from control subjects of future clinical trials that voluntarily conform to a uniform protocol for subject characterization and follow-up?  Are trials anticipated in subjects with COPD which could perform extensive subject characterization and long-term follow-up and contribute appropriate data and specimens to this program?

3.	Describe the personnel, facilities, and organization that would be required to carry out this program.  Would there be a need for an advisory panel; a network of clinical centers; a data coordinating center; centralized laboratories for biomarker, genomic, and genetic assays; and core centers for the analyses of CT image, genomic, and genetypic data?  Comment on the availability and costs of these resources and services.

This request for information is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation for applications/proposals or as an obligation on the part of the government.

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in the notice and following the Simplified Acquisition Procedures in FAR Part 13.5.  This requirement is a small business set aside. The U. S. Department of the Interior, National Business Center, on behalf of Wright Patterson Air Force Base, OH (US Air Force), intends to make a firm-fixed price award to the successful offeror. Real Time Location Systems (RTLSs) have proven to be value added tools for the asset tracking and management of many commercial activities.  Trucking, warehousing, and commercial aviation enterprises have all benefited from the use of RTLS tools in managing access and real time location of high dollar assets.  The United States Air Force is in need of improved tracking of Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) and believes that the proven capabilities of RTLS may be an avenue for possible use in tracking and locating AGE on an Air Force flightline.  Under the direction of Headquarters, Air Education Training Command (HQ AETC), this Performance Work Statement (PWS) describes the effort to be conducted by an Air Force Automatic Identification Technology Program Management Office (AF AIT PMO) contractor to expand on its initial AGE RTLS survey initiative at Luke AFB, AZ. The Government will use the WhereNet RTLS system at Luke AFB AZ for this effort.  The contractor shall design, install, and configure the system in four phases: 	Phase 1:  design validation/finalization 	Phase 2:  hardware/software configuration 	Phase 3:  verify RTLS system coverage area, and  	Phase 4:  system configuration and asset tagging.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity"t means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

SHELVING SPECIFICATIONS:    The shelves shall be solid steel of clip type or nut-and bolt type construction in accordance with Federal Specifications AA-S-1048 or AA-S-271d.  Open or skeleton type shelving units shall be provided.  Two levels of both side and back cross strap braces are required on all shelving units (Seismic Level 1).  The shelving must be powder-coated with a polyester epoxy hybrid or best equivalent available that passes NARA-conducted or independent lab tests for hardness, and coating stability, bending, adhesion, and durability.  All shelving shall be a parchment color, per Federal Standard 595a, or other equally light reflective color.  DIMENSIONS:  The shelving units shall be constructed in accordance with NARA¡¦s FRC Shelving Drawing Number 1, (attached).  All shelving units to be provided and installed shall comply with very strict specifications in order to achieve optimal records storage capacity and access with the use of standard-size records storage boxes, size 10¡¨ deep x 12¡¨ wide x 15¡¨ long.  Overall height of 12-shelf units is 135 inches.  Overall height for 14-shelf units is 159 inches. These overall heights are specified for space, operational and fire safety reasons.  The primary shelving units shall be size 30¡¨ deep x 42¡¨ wide, with a minimum load carrying capacity of 300 pounds each.  Fill-out shelving units, size 30¡¨d x 30¡¨w, minimum load carrying capacity of 200#, and 16¡¨ w x 30¡¨d, minimum load carrying capacity of 100#, are also required.  All shelves are to be spaced on 12-inch vertical centers above 2-inch high base closures.  In order to accommodate standard size records storage boxes and servicing space, the following clearances must be provided on the faces of all units.  At least 39¡¨ of clear horizontal shelf space must be provided between the posts on all of the 42¡¨ wide units.  At least 10-1/2¡¨ of clear vertical storage space must be provided between all installed shelves.  2¡¨ high base closures must be provided on the face of all shelving units so that all records stored on the bottom shelves throughout the facility will be 3¡¨ above the floor finish in order to avoid damage to the records shelved on the bottom shelves from water spills as well as to avoid the accumulation of dust or files spillage under the bottom shelves.  30¡¨ wide x 135¡¨ high or 159¡¨ high (depending on upright height) end panels (partitions) shall be installed on the sides of all units facing the main 5¡¦ wide service aisles.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for one Rotor Mounted Data Acquisition and Transmission System (RMDATS).  A Statement of Work that describes the work to be accomplished is attached to this Synopsis. The objective of the attached statement of work is to procure a Rotor Mounted Data Acquisition and Transmission System (RMDATS) that will be used for taking measurements of rotor mounted sensors during wind tunnel testing of large-scale rotorcraft models. RMDATS will condition 256 rotating helicopter model blade transducers, digitize transducer outputs, transmit digitized data from the rotating to the stationary plane, and then display and store the digitalized data on a PC located 210’ away from the model. All sensors connected to the RMDATS will be digitized simultaneously upon the arrival of an external signal issued by an encoder that measures rotor azimuth position. Data displayed and stored on the fixed frame PC must maintain the channel synchronization and azimuth position correlation. To meet these requirements, we anticipate that the RMDATS will be composed of three subsystems. The Rotating Subsystem will condition and digitized transducer outputs. The Transmission Subsystem will transmit digitized data and control information to the Ground Subsystem, as well as transmit control commands up to the Rotating Subsystem. The Ground Subsystem will be a workstation that controls the operating state of the Rotating Subsystem as well as displays and stores raw data and system status information.  Offerors shall address each of the items in the statement of work and detail how their proposed system meets the listed specifications. Items may be separately priced, however a total system price must be indicated as a single award for a total system will be made.

The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML-6032. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09 dated 5/19/06. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), performs basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens.  The RML has a need to purchase 2(two) Lots, 30(thirty) chips each of the Rat genome chip from the manufacturer. This chip shall be compatible with the Affymetrix fluidics and hybridization station, compatible with GCOS analysis and fully capable of Rat genome expression analysis. These gene chips are a one-time-use-only consumable and will be consumed in RML experiments.  The contractor shall provide to RML services to produce 2(two) Lots of chips, totaling approximately ~ 60(sixty) chips.  This is a 30(thirty) day, one time work effort, where the final product will be 2(two) Lots of Rat genome expression chips, at ~30(thirty) chips per lot.  The design and manufacturing process of this Rat gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix. The chip is high density,  at 106 per cm2 (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The  GeneChip® was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip® probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the Rat probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and even genus of bacteria. The Rat GeneChip® probe array is  housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array.  These chips shall be compatible with RML’s Affymetrix GeneArray® Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix  is compatible with the Affymetrix system in place within the Genomics Unit of the Research Technologies Section. FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.  Inside delivery shall be four (4) weeks after receipt of the order by Affymetrix.  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to respond back to questions asked: 

Questions and Answers for BATF04LEASE:

1 - Our vehicle vendors have indicated that some of the 2007 models have not yet been released. In that case, would 2006 models be acceptable? 

2007 on the Yukon or Tahoe, the rest 2006 is ok

2 - Is there color preferences on the vehicles?

Dark would be best
 
3 - In addition to quoting new vehicles, would it be acceptable to quote 2006/2007 low mileage vehicles as an alternative to new?

New is what we want



4. On the cargo vans you request a rear A/C. Since these units will be out of stock deliveries in all probablility there will be no vehicles available with this option. Will ATF accept dealer installed units?

We would want the SLT packages on the trucks and suburban. (Power windows, locks, AC etc…)


5. Most of the requested items GM models. Will you accept Doge or Ford if the prices is less than the GMS?

We want either GMC or Chevy.

    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002.

From:	Gail W. McDaniel
Contracting Officer	Reply to
Attn of:	Vpl-4
G. McDaniel

To:	FILE
Subj:	JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Ref:	(a) FAR 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition

1.  Pursuant to the requirements of FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-3, the justification for limited competition is justified by the following facts and rationale:
2.  MLCA (vpl) has a brand-name requirement to procure Christie & Grey Anti-Vibration Mounts for the USCGC Tornado.  Coast Guard Ship Drawings specify that Christie & Grey Anit-Vibration Mount be installed.  Christie & Grey, Limited, Kent, UK, is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the Christie & Grey Anti-Vibration Mount.  The OEM is the only source with the proprietary manufacturing data.  No alternative Anti-Vibration Mount has been approved to be used, nor is suitable.  This requirement does not allow time for a prototype to be developed.
3.  A combined synopsis/solicitation will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) with the intent to solicit quotes only from Christie & Grey dealers with unique capabilities to satisfy the Coast Guard’s requirement.  Quotes will be solicited only from Christie & Grey dealers as they the only vendors that are able to provide Christie & Grey parts and warranty.
