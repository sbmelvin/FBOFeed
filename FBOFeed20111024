<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement to continue some mission related support for theNational Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) PreparatoryProject (NPP). This mission support covers algorithm calibration/validation and scienceteam support for algorithms and data products and NPP 1394 serial bus systems engineeringsupport. NASA/GSFC intends to award a sole source three year contract consisting of a base yearwith two one year options to Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems (NGAS) of Redondo Beach,California. NGAS is currently providing this support under the NPOESS contract. InJanuary 2010, the Executive Office of the president directed a major restructuring of theNPOESS Program. This restructure eliminated the tri-agency governance of NPOESS and gavethe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration (NASA) primary responsibility for the afternoon orbit satellitesproviding civil weather forecasting and climate data in a program called the JPSS. Underthis restructure, NASA assumed the responsibility of managing some of the NPOESSsubcontracts and converted them to prime contracts. However, this requirement remainedunder the NPOESS contract which is now being transferred to a NASA/GSFC contract. This isa subset of the same work presently preformed under the original contract. This missionsupport covers algorithm development, integration and testing, anomaly resolution, andcalibration/validation support for the NPP algorithms and data products and NPP 1394serial bus systems engineering support. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note26. Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) - Only OneResponsible Source. However, any organization who believes they can provide these itemswithout any detrimental impact to the NPP mission should fully identify their interestand capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Interestedorganizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort inwriting to the identified point of contact not later than 5:00 p.m. EST on November 07,2011. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose ofdetermining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Adetermination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<SUBJECT>Earth Pressures on Deep Foundation Walls during Seismic Events
<SOLNBR>RS-04-10-160
<CONTACT>Kala Shankar, Sr. Contract Specialist, Phone 301-492-3638, Fax 301-492-3437, Email kala.shankar@nrc.gov - Jeffrey R. Mitchell, Senior Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 492-3639, Fax (301) 492-3437, Email jeffrey.mitchell@nrc.gov
<DESC>The importance of seismically-induced (or dynamic) pressure on walls was recognized by Okabe (1924) and Mononobe (1929) following the great Kanto earthquake of 1923. This insight led to the development of the Mononobe-Okabe (M-O) method for determining seismically-&not;induced lateral earth pressures on walls. Although decades have passed since the M-O method was developed, and a number of other relationships and methods have been developed, seismically-induced lateral earth pressures are still very poorly understood and very few predictive tools exist. This is because the difficulties of obtaining actual field data, coupled with the complexity and cost of the necessarily large scale laboratory studies, have resulted in a problematic lack of data. As a result, the M-O method is still the most widely used tool for predicting seismically-induced lateral earth pressure with finite element modeling used for advanced analyses. Unfortunately, lack of accuracy and precision remain significant issues. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is interested in investigating new approaches to the determination of dynamic lateral earth pressures during seismic events. <br /><br />In an effort to address this need, several years ago the NRC undertook a project in which Brookhaven National Laboratory used the computational tools SASSI and LS DYNA to attempt to replicate seismic wall pressure that had been recorded in a series of experiments undertaken by the Nuclear Power Engineering Corporation (NUPEC ) through support by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan. The BNL analyses and results are reported in NUREG/CR-6957. The NUPEC Seismic Field Test Program is described in NUREG/CR-6822. Unfortunately, while the analyses were able to replicate the acceleration of the structures to a large degree, the predicted lateral pressures showed a poor fit to the recorded data. This work again showed the challenges the engineering community faces in predicting dynamic lateral earth pressures with the level of accuracy desired by the structural engineering community. <br /><br />Accurate prediction of seismically-induced earth pressures and the associated structural response are of interest for NRC staff because several advanced reactor designs propose to fully or partially embed reactor structures as one of their major design features. <br /><br />NRC research has the principal goals of providing technical bases and technical tools to aid NRC staff in making regulatory decisions and developing and disseminating regulatory guidance that is used by both the NRC staff and the nuclear industry to make safety decisions by the agency. Research outcomes should be consistent with and support these goals.
<p>The objectives of this contract are to assess existing analytical tools and develop recommendations on their appropriate use for calculating soil pressures and structural response of partially to fully embedded nuclear power plants under seismic loading conditions. <br /><br />It is anticipated that this requirement will result in one (1) contract award. It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract. <br />The period of performance of the resultant contract will be forty eight (48) months from date of award. <br /><br />The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about October 22, 2010, and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website.

Strengthen advocacy and oversight of non-governmental actors to increase accountability and transparency of Security and Justice Sector Institutions</p>
<p>For the purpose of contributing to this, the Project will have a robust cross-cutting component on communications, public outreach and social marketing.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The AF Safety Center (AFSC) at Kirtland AFB, NM is requesting information and a quote to fabricate a display stand to mount a metal space debris object to display in front of their building. The stand will support a hollow metallic sphere with the following dimensions: circumference at the top is approximately three feet, the height is approximately 3.5 feet, and the base is approximately three feet. The weight of the object that the stand will support is approximately 140 pounds. The object will be placed in a stand that is suggested to be circular and be approximately four feet in height with supports that will withstand winds in excess of 70 mph and resistant to corrosion. The stand should also have the capability to rotate so all areas of the space debris can be viewed (this requirement may be waived if it's too difficult or costly). The stand will also include inserts or a placard where background information can be inserted or etched regarding background information on the displayed object.

<CONTACT>Dan D. Finley, Contracting Officer, Phone 2147675255, Fax 2147675194, Email dan.finley@ihs.gov
<DESC>This acquisition is a <strong>100% Small Business Set-Aside</strong>. Responses under this Notice will be considered only from entities classified as small businesses under NAICS Code 541310, Architectural Services, and must have average annual revenues of $4.5 Million or less to meet this requirement. All partners of Joint-Venture respondents must be classified as Small Businesses under the applicable NAICS Code to be eligible for consideration. Responses from all other firms are ineligible for consideration.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Division of Engineering Services - Dallas, of the Indian Health Service (IHS), on behalf of the Albuquerque and Navajo Area Indian Health Services, Office of Environmental Health and Engineering, seeks Qualifications statements of Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms to provide professional design services for various projects. Qualifications documents submitted in response to this notice will be used to select the highest qualified A-E firm to issue a Request for Proposal for various rates and eventual award of an Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under which individual projects will be awarded on separate delivery orders after a firm fixed-price is negotiated based on various applicable rates established under the basic IDIQ contract with that firm.<br /><br />Professional services comprise planning, design, and related A-E services including construction contract administration and post-construction contract services for various federal and tribal health facilities and support facilities located in Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado. Health facilities include medical centers, hospitals, dental clinics, healthcare clinics, support facilities and buildings, and associated infrastructure ranging in size from 1,000 square feet to 256,000 square feet. Under this potential contract, IHS plans to conduct projects to perform major maintenance, periodic repair of building components, and facility improvements. There would be little potential to design new facilities based on current projections.<br /><br />The work will primarily involve requirements for federally operated Indian Health facilities at or near the following localities but may be at any location the Albuquerque or Navajo Area of the Indian Health Service are responsible for:
<p>Albuquerque, NM Bernalillo, NM<br />Dulce, NM Mescalero, NM<br />San Felipe, NM San Fidel, NM<br />Santa Fe, NM Taos, NM<br />Zuni, NM Ignacio, CO<br />Towaoc, CO<br />Bloomfield, NM<br />Chinle, AZ Crownpoint, NM<br />Gallup, NM Inscription House, AZ<br />Kayenta, AZ Pinon, AZ<br />Pueblo Pintado, NM Red Mesa, AZ<br />Shiprock, NM <br />Sonostee, NM <br />Tohatchi, NM Toadlena, AZ<br />Tsaile, AZ</p>
<p>The resultant IDIQ contract will contain negotiated rates for use to establish firm fixed-prices for delivery order projects. That IDIQ contract will be for a base period of one year from the date of award with four one-year options that may be exercised at the Government's discretion. IHS anticipates awarding a contract to a single firm for this IDIQ requirement.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Required Architect-Engineer Services<br /></span></strong>Services that would be required under individual delivery orders include, but are not limited to, the following:<br /><br />a. Evaluation, Assessment, and Planning Services: facility condition assessments; site development feasibility studies; conceptual designs; cost estimating; space planning and space efficiency studies; energy modeling and investment-grade energy feasibilities studies; building systems evaluations; electrical studies including short-circuit and arc-flash coordination studies, load studies, selective breaker coordination and evaluation of power quality problems; pre-design commissioning recommendations; legal survey work for real property transfers including metes and bounds surveys.<br /><br />b. Design Services: development of design and construction documents (i.e. drawings, specifications) and associated engineering work in accordance with the most current Indian Health Service "Architect/Engineer (A/E) Design Guide".<br /><br />c. Construction Contract Administration and other A-E related services: participating in pre-construction conferences; responding to construction contractor requests for information (RFIs); reviewing construction submittals and shop drawings; performing construction inspections and preparing field observation reports; advising the project officer regarding deficiencies and actions required or recommended; preparing supplementary drawings or revision drawings; managing document versions and revisions; reviewing contract modification proposals; and, reviewing contractor progress payment requests.<br /><br />d. Post-Construction Contract Services: reviewing, assessing, and confirming that building systems and equipment have been installed and operate in accordance with commissioning requirements; reviewing operation and maintenance manuals for completeness; preparing conformed-set drawings; preparing record drawings and as-built drawings; issuing certificates of completion (often required to be prepared and signed by a registered professional engineer); provide certification that fire protection systems are correctly installed and operational, providing training on proper operation, maintenance of equipment, support for building automation, and systems troubleshooting.<br /><br />e. Integrate Sustainable Features: To the maximum extent possible these scope items shall integrate or include sustainability features that will reduce the energy usage, water usage, reduce emissions, divert solid waste, reduce consumption of toxic materials and chemicals, increase organic waste diversion, ensure retrofitting and renovation promotes building's long term viability, and other sustainable enhancements.</p>
<p>We estimate there will be 8 - 12 task orders during the first year with the most common cost magnitude per task order ranging from $10k - $250k. The A-E firm selected must be able to provide the full scope of required services listed above. However,&nbsp;Evaluation, Assessment, and Planning Services and Design Services will likely be utilized the most frequently.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A-E Qualifications Submission Form and Format<br /></span></strong>Interested firms must prepare and submit an original plus five (5) copies (identified as such on the face of each) of a recently completed <strong>Standard Form (SF) 330 (Parts I and II), Architect-Engineer Qualifications</strong> pursuant to the instructions contained on the SF330, to the Contracting Officer no later than November 29, 2011.

A link to download this form is visible on the right-hand side of the webpage where you are viewing this Notice.<br /><br /><strong>Address your submission as follows</strong>:<br /><br />SF330 - 12-161-SOL-00001<br />Attn: Contracting Officer<br />IHS Division of Engineering Services - Dallas<br />1301 Young Street, Suite 1071<br />Dallas, TX 75202-5433<br /><br />When completing the SF330, include information on the key team members who would be utilized for projects under this contract, incorporating relevant personnel of subconsultants and subcontractors. If partnering with another or multiple firms in a Joint-Venture, please submit a single SF330 for the entire team. <br /><br />You may submit supplementary information that assists to illustrate your firm's ability to meet the evaluation criteria listed below. However, to expedite review and evaluation, your SF330 submission package should not exceed sixty (60) typed pages unless partnering (in a Joint-Venture arrangement) with additional firms, in which case the maximum length of your submission may be increased by an additional 10 pages for each additional partnering firm. The Qualifications documents may be submitted in folders, binding combs or similar metal or plastic spiral bound booklets or in loose-leaf form bound using small paper binder clips. However, if the SF330 package is bound, do not use 2- or 3-ring loose leaf binders for this purpose.<br /><br /><strong>CAUTION:</strong> It is highly recommend that the actual SF330 be used for your submission, along with any necessary supplemental pages. If you do not use the SF330, your submission must follow the precise format and sequence of the SF330 to facilitate evaluation. SUBMISSIONS THAT DO NOT STRICTLY FOLLOW THE FORMAT OF THE SF330 MAY BE DETERMINED AS NON-RESPONSIVE TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS NOTICE AND NOT EVALUATED FURTHER.<br /><br />IHS may create a shortlist of A-E respondents based on the initial evaluation results. Respondents selected for this second evaluation phase would be required to attend a face-to- face interview with the Source Selection Board members. Appropriate Respondents would be notified when and if the Interview Stage is added to the evaluation process.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A-E Design Services Technical Evaluation Criteria<br /></span></strong>The A-E firm's Qualifications response should adequately address each Evaluation Criterion. All responsive submissions will be evaluated and ranked using the following criteria, weighted as indicated:<br /><br />1. Professional Qualifications and Experience of Nominated Team Members - 20%<br /><br />2. Management Plan and Team Organization - 20%<br /><br />3. Geographic Proximity - 20% <br /><br />4. Corporate Specialized Experience - 20%<br /><br />5. Past Performance -10%<br /><br />6. Capacity to Accomplish the Work/Stability of Firm - 10%<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Evaluation Criteria Details<br /></span></strong>&gt; <strong>Professional Qualifications and Experience of Nominated Team Members</strong> - Relevant qualifications and experience covering the following activities, as related to health facilities and associated structures, for each team member:<br />&bull; Evaluation, Assessment and Planning Services<br />&bull; Design Services<br />&bull; Construction Contract Administration Support Services<br />&bull; Post-Construction Contract Services <br />&bull; Integration of Sustainability into Design of Construction and Renovation Projects<br /><br />&gt; <strong>Management Plan &amp; Team Organization</strong> - The degree to which the anticipated management plan and team organization, including degree of principle participation with particular attention to the Prime Contractor's obligation to meet the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, "Limitation on Subcontracting"<strong>*</strong>, production coordination, division of work, quality assurance, cost control, and prior experience of the project team as a unit, will meet the overall requirements of the contract.<br /><br />&gt; <strong>Geographic Proximity</strong> - Location of principal offices, branch offices and staff of the Prime A-E firm relative to potential work sites and the IHS Area Offices in Albuquerque, NM and St. Michaels/Window Rock, AZ, to increase the efficiency of service delivery and availability during delivery order performance. The majority of work will be on or near Indian reservations in northern Arizona, southern Colorado and New Mexico.<br /><br />&gt; <strong>Corporate Specialized Experience</strong> - Extent and quality of relevant specialized experience relating to engineering and architectural assessment of health facilities and the planning, design, construction contract administrative support, post-construction support, and facility maintenance support services relating to small facility renovations, expansions, maintenance, improvement and environmental projects at rural health centers serving Native Americans and working in a federal context. Examples include, but are not limited to:<br /><br />&bull; Experience working with small communities;<br />&bull; Experience assisting clients in complying with federal environmental protection rules and laws associated with the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA);<br />&bull; Experience working in Indian Country or with Indian tribes;<br />&bull; Experience working with LEED or other environmentally sustainable design principles and standards (such as ASHRAE 189.1).<br />&bull; Familiarity with the unique fiduciary responsibilities held by the federal government.<br />&bull; Experience working with federal agencies.<br /><br />&gt; <strong>Past Performance</strong> - Past performance on similar contracts with government agencies, tribal agencies, and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. Past performance documentation should, at a minimum, include a list of comparable projects. Each listed project should include the following.<br /><br />&bull; Owner<br />&bull; Owner contact information<br />&bull; Brief project description<br />&bull; Cost of the project<br /><br />&gt; <strong>Capacity to Accomplish the Work / Stability of Firm</strong> - Demonstrate the project team's capacity to perform and respond to a varying and uncertain workload in a timely manner. Identify firm's capacity to allocate additional resources as needed. Identify the project team leader(s) for whom the delivery orders will be assigned, and identify at least one secondary individual for whom the day-to-day responsibilities would fall to as a backup. Provide an overview of the stability/solvency of the firm and explain how it has grown or contracted over the past 5 and 10 year periods or since inception if less than these periods.<br /><br /><strong>* <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IMPORTANT NOTICE</span></strong>: In formulating the Qualifications submission, potential respondents should consider that FAR 52.219-14, which will be incorporated into any resultant contract, requires the Prime Contractor to perform services under the contract equivalent to 50% or more of the contract value in personnel costs throughout the life of the contract. This is a positive requirement rather than one where an indication of capacity, capability or willingness to meet these requirements would be acceptable. Respondents should demonstrate in their Qualifications submission how they will meet this requirement. Although the specific project effort awarded under any resultant contract is not known at this time, it is believed to be unlikely a Respondent could reasonably expect to meet this FAR requirement where they propose a Prime Contractor role limited to a single discipline, or possibly even multiple disciplines, where the discipline mix proposed leans towards disciplines typically not heavily utilized in A-E Services for medical facilities.</p>

<DESC><p>The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced, and interested potential business capable of providing Protective Service Officers (PSO) services throughout Northern Florida. A PSO is the equivalent of an Armed Guard II as set forth in the DOL Directory of Occupations. The information requested by this Sources Sought may be used within the FPS to facilitate acquisition planning and will not be disclosed outside of the Government.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be required to provide and maintain all management, supervision, manpower, training, equipment, supplies, licenses, permits, certificates, insurance, pre-employment screenings, reports, files and any other resources necessary to accomplish the security services. The contract will require a facility security clearance. PSOs will be required to be armed and some posts may require screening of visitors using x-rays/magnetometers. All personnel supporting the contract will be required to meet FPS training, certification, suitability standards and the security services to be provided will include:</p>
<p>Basic Services - Basic services are the permanent ongoing services specifically included in the task order(s) at time of award or added through modification up to any established maximums identified in the contract.</p>
<p>Temporary Additional Services - During the term of the contract, the Government may have requirements for temporary additional services (TAS) beyond the basic services requirements. TAS are the short term, non-recurring needs for service such as an increase in hours to an existing or subsequently added post to include the weekend where a public demonstration is taking place over the weekend, addition of posts to provide for increased security for special events or high profile visitor to the building, extension of existing post hours in a building to cover seasonal fluctuations (such as at an IRS building during tax season), etc. Due to the nature of TAS the Contractor may be required to perform these services with little advance notice.</p>
<p>Emergency Security Services - The Contractor shall furnish fully qualified PSOs, management, supervision, equipment, supplies and any other cost for sustained emergency surge security force services. Deployments may be to large and small-scale events such as natural disasters, civil disturbances, or other unanticipated events on an as-needed basis. The requirements under "ESS" Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) may be ordered for anywhere in the geographic area covered under this contract with little, if any advance notice. There will be no "phase-in" period for these requirements. The contractor shall have sufficient, fully qualified staff to meet all requirements ordered under the ESS CLIN at any time.</p>
<p>The training requirements to be provided by the contractor for all PSOs working under this effort can be broken down into four categories:</p>
<p>One Time Only<br />40 hour Basic Training<br />Initial Weapons Training<br />Orientation Training<br />Supervisor Training</p>
<p><br />Annual<br />AED<br />CPR<br />Less-Than-Lethal Weapons (i.e. Baton/OC Spray)</p>
<p>Semi-Annual<br />Weapons</p>
<p>Every Three Years<br />First-Aid<br />Refresher Training</p>
<p>This acquisition is for approximately 420,000 hours of basic service, 17,500 hours of temporary additional services and 6,000 hours of emergency security services per year. Currently, there are an estimated 190 guards protecting approximately 135 posts at over 90 buildings. The estimated value of this contract is between $10M and $15M.</p>
<p>For purposes of the Sources Sought, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561612 and the small business size standard is $18.5 million. If you believe your firm is capable of providing the requirements described in this Sources Sought, please provide capability information using the attached sources sought questionnaire in excel format via email to Michael DeCrescio (215-521-2263), Michael.decrescio@dhs.gov by November 2, 2011 at 1500 EST. In the subject line of your e-mail response, please provide your firm name and the solicitation number (HSHQE4-12-R-00004). The Government requests that you do NOT submit any other company promotional or informational material.</p>

The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting market research on behalf of the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD) to obtain information on responsible sources that can provide a compact, lightweight, prime-power system that will enable the development of directed energy (DE) non-lethal (NL) capabilities

Background:

The JNLWD is conducting market research for compact, lightweight, prime-power technologies.
  The JNLWD wants to develop long-range DE systems that can be used in a stand-alone configuration or integrated onto small tactical vehicles for a range of NL applications.  A key component to enable the development of these systems is a prime power system that can achieve the required performance in a compact size.

The prime power system for NL DE capabilities can be quite different from continuous AC/DC power generators or sources because they need large amounts of power for only short but numerous timeframes.  An example load versus time profile for a NL DE system would be 100% load for 5 minutes and 25% load for 55 minutes each hour.

The prime power systems must be capable of achieving or exceeding the key performance specifications listed below.

Key Performance Specifications

The following are the key performance specifications for the prime power system.

	Average power output:  150 kW to 250 kW 
	Fuel type:  JP8 Fuel
	Fuel Efficiency:  > 4.6 kWh/kg at 75% load factor, > 4 kWh/kg at 25% load factor
	Operating temperature range:  -50 C to +50 C
	Output voltage:  345 VDC +/- 10%
	Efficiency:  96% efficient generator head
	Threshold:  6,000 W/ft3 (threshold), 16,000 W/ft3 (objective)
	Threshold:  100 W/lb (threshold), 500 W/lb (objective)
	Shock/Vibration Specifications: To be fully described in the information provided by the submission
	System Reliability Specifications: > 10000 hr mean-time-between-failure (MTBF) desired
	System Availability: >0.95

JNLWD will host an Industry Day to establish a dialogue with interested potential vendors and to answer questions on the background and technical issues pertaining to a compact, lightweight, prime-power system for high power microwave (HPM) and radio frequency (RF) non-lethal capabilities.
  This Industry Day will occur on Friday, 04 November 2011 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. at American Systems Corporation, 3600 Pointe Center Ct., Suite 250, Dumfries, VA 22026. Parking is available at this location. The conference space can accommodate 104 seats so we request contractors limit company attendance to no more than two representatives.  The first 91 respondents are guaranteed seats.  Additional requests will be placed on a wait-list.  Attendance is restricted to pre-registered applicants possessing photo identification on arrival.  This meeting is UNCLASSIFIED; no visit request is required.  The meeting will begin promptly at 2:30 pm EDT. We recommend that you plan to arrive no later than 2:00 pm to accommodate for check-in delays.
  If the attendee is a U.S. citizen, please provide the following information to gerald.francom@usmc.mil not later than 12:00 pm on Wednesday, 02 November:  full name, company name, e-mail address, contact phone number, and mailing address.

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) - "Every Day Counts Innovation Initiatives" http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/everydaycounts/</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) hereby requests information from all sources regarding innovations that have the potential to transform the way we do business by shortening project delivery, enhancing the safety of our roadways, and protecting the environment. The purpose of this RFI is to hear from our state, local, and industry partners regarding ideas for accelerated deployment of proven processes or technologies that have the potential to provide efficiencies at all levels of the transportation system. This RFI is issued under the FHWA Every Day Counts Innovation Initiative.</p>
<p>NOTE: This is a RFI notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals or applications, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose for this RFI notice is to conduct market research to identify proven innovations. This RFI notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract or grant, nor does the Government intend to directly pay for any information or responses submitted as the result of this RFI notice. Information obtained as a result of this RFI notice may be used by the Government for program planning on a non-attribution basis. Do not include any information that might be considered proprietary or confidential.<br /><br />2. BACKGROUND. FHWA Administrator Mendez has advocated that deploying innovation to shorten project delivery and accelerating the penetration of innovative technology into the market place need to become part of our everyday business model. The economic circumstances that have posed such difficult challenges to transportation agencies at all levels will remain a challenge for some time to come. To that end, FHWA launched Every Day Counts (EDC) - a broad concept to shorten project delivery and speed the deployment of proven, underutilized technologies. The EDC initiative has had a successful inaugural year and is already beginning to have an impact on the transportation system. What the Administrator initiated and what we all built together must continue.</p>
<p>FHWA believes that a foundation has been laid to make innovation a cornerstone of our business, and we can continue to identify rapidly deployable innovations that achieve the goal of better, faster and smarter project delivery. Our society and our industry face an unprecedented list of challenges. Because of our economy, we need to work more efficiently. The public wants greater accountability in how we spend their money. We need to find ways to make our roads safer, and we have an obligation to help preserve our planet for future generations.</p>
<p>The EDC initiative focuses on two pillars for innovation.</p>
<p>(1) Accelerating Technology: 21st century technologies and solutions to improve safety, reduce congestion, produce longer-lasting infrastructure, and keep America moving and competitive in the world market.<br />(2) Shortening Project Delivery: Innovative practices that increase our ability to deliver timely transportation projects to the public.</p>
<p>When identifying innovations under these pillars, FHWA considers the following:</p>
<p>Impact: How the innovation will affect the transportation system.<br />Readiness: How soon the impact of deploying the innovation can be realized.<br />Affordability: Efficient use of resources to implement and maintain.<br />Urgency and Scale: Potential to positively impact the environment, safety, congestion, freight movement, construction techniques, contracting methods, project costs, maintenance, preservation or emergency response.</p>
<p>3. REQUESTED CONTENT OF RESPONSES TO THIS RFI NOTICE. FHWA invites all sources to submit a response to this RFI notice. Responses shall clearly identify:</p>
<p>&bull;1. Organization name<br />&bull;2. Point(s) of contact, e-mail address, and telephone number<br />&bull;3. Description of a proven process or technology aimed at reducing the time and money required to deliver transportation projects while protecting the environment and enhancing safety and performance.<br />&bull;a. What is the process or technology? (Provide a clear, concise description.) <br />&bull;b. What makes the process or technology transformative and "game changing" in time, money, and quality?<br />&bull;c. What makes this process or technology nationally significant?<br />&bull;d. What evidence demonstrates the process or technology is viable now in a transportation application? Where and how has it has been successfully applied?<br />&bull;e. How does the process or technology affect time and costs in a way that is tangible and quantifiable? <br />&bull;f. What are the quantifiable performance benefits of the process or technology?<br />&bull;g. What supporting specifications, guidelines, and /or procedures are available to support successful national deployment? <br />&bull;h. Who are the champions of this process or technology?</p>
<p>4. SUBMITTAL INFORMATION.</p>
<p>RFI NOTICE ISSUE DATE: October 24, 2011<br />DUE DATE FOR RESPONSES: December 1, 2011 by 11:59 pm Eastern<br />SUBMIT RESPONSES TO: everydaycounts@dot.gov<br />SUBMIT QUESTIONS TO: everydaycounts@dot.gov</p>

<DESC>NASA Headquarters has a requirement to continue work under the HeadquartersInformation Technology Support Services (HITSS) contract NNH06CC93B with InDyne, Inc. HITSS supports Headquarters in the following areas:  IT and Management Support,Appplications Development and Web Site Development and Maintenance, Systems Engineeringand Integration, NASA Headquarters Computer Center and Telecommunications Services,Customer Services, and IT Security.NASA intends to award a sole-source contract extension, for an additional six (6) monthsthrough May 31, 2012, to InDyne, Inc. pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only OneResponsible Source and increase the contract value by $16,000,000.  This extension willallow the continuation of current work and the addition of new work until the HITSScompetitive follow-on contract is awarded.  The HITSS follow-on RFP was released on April8, 2011 and proposals were received May 23, 2011.The contract extension is necessary to ensure the continuity of IT support services toNASA Headquarters.  IT support is a mission critical funciton to all Headquarters MissionDirectorate and Mission Support Offices.  Headquarters provides overall guidance anddirection to the Agency and as such this extension is necessary to avoid significantadverse impacts to the Agency in carrying out the NASA mission.A sole-source award to InDyne for the contract extension is necessary due to the natureand urgency of the work performed under this contract and the fact that we are conductinga competitive follow-on procurement.  InDyne has the combined training, experience andexpertise to provide uniterrupted continuation of mission critical IT support.	Shouldthese services be interrupted NASA Headquarters will be unable to utilize the HeadquarterIT infrastructure and systems required for providing leadership and management to theAgency.  If NASA Headquarters attempts to procure these services from any other sourcefor this interim period, it will cause impacts in fulfilling NASA's mission due to theadditional time needed for any other source to reach the current level of expertise ofInDyne.  Because of the time in procuring and planning another contract, InDyne isconsidered the only contractor that can meet NASA's needs given the short term of theextension.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing, via e-mail, to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 PMlocal time on TBD.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon the responses of this notice, is solely within thediscretion of the Government.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health is considering the option of migrating from a paper-based process to an electronic system for the submission of R&amp;D contract proposals. Other portions of the contract management process-from proposal to award-already use electronic systems. Thus, analogous to the receipt of grant applications that occurs through Grants.gov, tools that allow for the secure submission of contract proposals via the Internet may be developed or be adopted at NIH. Electronic submission may entail the receipt of proposal information in PDF file formats that are text-extractable and have some structured data attributes that can link with the NIH-wide systems used for contract award management.
<p>This RFI does not seek information on marketplace solutions for such systems, although this may be sought in a later announcement. Before deciding on the adoption of any Internet-based system for electronic proposal submissions, feedback from the community of potential users, e.g. offerors, is needed for the concerns that follow:</p>
<p>1. Cite possible benefits to your organization or agency of an Internet-based electronic proposal submission system.</p>
<p>2. Cite possible drawbacks to your organization or agency of an Internet-based electronic proposal submission system.</p>
<p>3. Cite features, if any, that you or your organization would like to see in an Internet-based electronic proposal submission system. Please note any particular characteristics or capabilities that would be particularly helpful.<br /><br />4. If your organization is a potential offeror to government solicitations, if applicable, discuss how an Internet-based electronic submission system would affect your ability to respond to an NIH solicitation.</p>
<p>5. Please give a term that describes your organization(for example, small business, for profit institution, non-profit, professional society, non-university research institution, public university, private university, medical school, government, etc.).</p>
<p>This RFI notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract or grant, nor does the Government intend to directly pay for any information or responses submitted as the result of this RFI notice.</p>

<DESC>TO REGISTER FOR THIS EVENT, THE ATTACHED FILE GPO_IF_SUB_FORM.PDF MUST BE COMPLETED AND RETURNED TO DANIELLE.MAESTAS@NAVY.MIL AND theodore.fiske.ctr@navy.mil

The U.S. Navys Geothermal Program Office (GPO), as the lead office within the Department of Defense (DoD) for the exploration, development and management of geothermal energy resources on all DoD installations, has adopted an aggressive exploration philosophy aimed at identifying and assisting in the development of geothermal energy resources on military installations throughout the United States.  As a step toward development of new geothermal resources, the GPO is requesting to host an Industry Forum for the purpose of eliciting information from the geothermal industry on the potential for future geothermal development on specified DoD properties; and further on the types of information that industry would require in order to make a reasoned judgment on the commercial viability of those and future unspecified properties.
  There is no specific contractual requirement related to this forum. Information acquired from contractors under the framework of the forum is for market research solely and may or may not be used in developing future contractual requirements. 

Through its exploration efforts, the GPO has acquired and analyzed a significant body of geological data on a number of potentially promising DoD properties. 

The GPO has significant expertise in the geological analysis required in the location of potential geothermal sites but requires access to industry knowledge and expertise in the transition to energy production in todays marketplace. 

For the purposes of the forum the GPO will be providing available technical geological/geothermal data for the specified properties for review by industry prior to the event.
  Industry will be invited to engage the GPO in one-on-one discussions on a broad range of topics related to the process for transition between resource exploration and assessment to development and utilization. Potential topics might range from the types of geological/geothermal data the industry would find most beneficial in assessing economic viability of a site, to the different production technologies that might be appropriate to a site, or to the types of business arrangements that might be necessary in contracting for geothermal site development.

However, any manufacturer that determines it can meet the requirements may give written notice via e-mail to Mark.Knorr2@va.gov by 12:00PM EST on Friday, October 28, 2011. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to meet the subject requirement, at no cost or obligation to the Government. All responses received will be evaluated, however the information received will be used solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer. If no responses are received, the VA Medical Center, Wilkes-Barre, PA, will proceed with a sole source procurement to The Spectranetics Corporation.

<p>This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-53, Defense Acquisition Circular 20111004, and Air Force Acquisition Circular 2011-0714. The following FAR Clauses and Provisions apply to this acquisition: <br />52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration (CCR)<br />52.204-9, Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel<br />52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items<br />Addendum to 52.212-1(c), Period for Acceptance of Offers. The paragraph is tailored as follows: -The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>Addendum TO 52.212-1 PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>To assure timely and equitable evaluation of proposals, offerors must follow the instructions contained herein. Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. The response shall consist of two (2) separately bound parts, Part I - Price Proposal, and Part II - Past Performance Information.</p>
<p>B. SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>1. PART I - PRICE PROPOSAL:</p>
<p><br />a. Complete the attached Bid Schedule, to include all option periods. Unit prices shall prevail in the event the extended price is calculated incorrectly.</p>
<p>b. Complete the necessary fill-ins and certifications in provisions. The provisions FAR 52.212-3 shall be returned along with the proposal.</p>
<p>c. Acknowledge any and all amendments to the solicitation.</p>
<p>d. The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists; offerors may be required to submit information other than cost or pricing data to support a determination of price reasonableness.</p>
<p>2. PART II - PAST PERFORMANCE - Limited to no more than 5 pages per contract listed. Only references for the same or similar type contract desired. Submit original plus one copy.</p>
<p>a. Quality and Satisfaction Rating for Contracts Completed in the Past Five Years from the date of issuance of the solicitation: Provide any information currently available (letters, metrics, customer surveys, independent surveys, etc.) which demonstrates customer satisfaction with overall job performance and quality of completed product for same or similar type contract. In addition, explain corrective actions taken in the past, if any, for substandard performance and any current performance problems such as cost overruns, extended performance periods, numerous warranty calls, etc.</p>
<p>b. With the Performance Questionnaire, in addition to para a above, the government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this RFP. The government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal Government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance. Provide a list of at least three (3) but no more than ten (10) of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last five (5) years of issuance of the solicitation. Relevant past performance is defined as contracts that required the offeror to conduct security manager duties as provided in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) contained in this solicitation. Recent past performance is defined as contracts performed within the last five years from date of issuance of solicitation, but limited to the most recent 10 contracts. Offerors with no past experience in security manager duties shall state so. Past performance information shall include information on corporate experience and past performance which clearly demonstrates that the offeror is capable of conforming to contractual requirements. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Past performance regarding minor members of joint ventures or teaming arrangements will be considered as highly as the majority member of those arrangements. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>c. Offerors shall submit a consecutive list of all past and present performance for the last five years from the date of the solicitation. The list shall include a minimum of 3 contracts but limited to the most recent 10 contracts. Offerors shall submit the list no later than the date and time indicated in the combined synopsis/solicitation, to 509 CONS/LGCB, Attn: Kaitlyn West, 727 Second Street, Suite 124A, Whiteman AFB, MO 65305-5344.

Comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions.</p>
<p>If a teaming arrangement is contemplated, provide complete information as to the arrangement, including any relevant and recent past/present performance information on previous teaming arrangements with same partner. If this is a first time joint effort, each party to the arrangement must provide a list of past and present relevant contract.</p>
<p>d. Each offeror is responsible for sending the attached past performance questionnaire to its references. Upon completion of the questionnaires, they shall be returned directly from the references to the attention of 509 CONS/LGCB, Attn: Kaitlyn West, 727 Second Street, Suite 124A, Whiteman AFB, MO 65305-5344. This list may be provided by fax to (660) 687-5462 or email to 509cons.sollgcb@whiteman.af.mil. Completed questionnaires must be submitted no later than the offer due date and time indicated in the combined synopsis/solicitation. This requirement for the submission of questionnaires is in addition to the requirement for a list of consecutive contracts specified in paragraph 2(a)(1) above.</p>
<p>e. Offerors are cautioned that the Government will use information provided by the offerors and information obtained by other sources in the development of the performance confidence assessment.</p>
<p>f. Subcontractor Consent: Past performance information pertaining to a subcontractor cannot be disclosed to the prime offeror without the subcontractor's consent. Provide with the proposal a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime offeror.</p>
<p>52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items<br />Addendum to FAR 52.212-2: <br />A. Basis For Contract Award: The basis of award for this acquisition will be Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT). A pass/fail technical evaluation will be conducted on the contractor's ability to meet the requirements in section 5.0 of the PWS. Only those contractors that have an acceptable technical proposal will be considered for award using the Performance Price Tradeoff method.</p>
<p>B. Evaluation Criteria:</p>
<p>1. PRICE: For award purposes, the Government will evaluate the total prices in the Base and Option Periods of this solicitation. The total price of the Base or Option Period is the sum of the extended unit prices within the applicable period. The extended amounts for the base period and all option periods, will be added together for a total contract price and will be used for the ranking of offerors. Unit prices shall prevail in the event the extended price is calculated incorrectly. The Government may determine an offer unacceptable if the proposed prices are materially unbalanced, which is defined as significantly understated or overstated in relation to the actual cost of the item or when the price is determined not to be fair and reasonable. Proposed prices will become fixed prices on the contract. In the event the Government extends services under the authority of FAR 52.217-8, "Option to Extend Services", unit pricing for the last option period exercised preceding the extension shall remain in effect. These prices are already determined to have been evaluated at time of contract award.</p>
<p>a. Total evaluated amount for Base Period and Option Periods: Extended amounts for CLINS 0001 thru 2001 are all added together for a total for that specific period.</p>
<p>b. Total Contract Amount: (Total Evaluated Amount for Base Period) + (Total Evaluated Amount for Option Period 1) + (Total Evaluated Amount for Option Period 2) = Total Evaluated Amount.</p>
<p>c. The Contracting Officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the Contracting Officer will review this determination and if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists, no additional cost/price information will be requested. However, if at any time during this competition the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offeror's may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of price.</p>
<p>2. EVALUATING PAST PERFORMANCE: The evaluation team will assess past performance, specifically information on relevant and recent contracts obtained from the results of past performance surveys. Using questionnaires, the evaluation team shall seek performance information on the offeror's based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.</p>
<p>a. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to make an evaluation of the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the RFQ, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. Relevant past performance is defined as security manager duties as provided in the Performance Work Statement contained in this solicitation. Recent past performance is defined as contracts performed within the last five years from date of issuance of solicitation, but limited to the most recent 10 contracts. Offerors with no past experience in security manager duties shall state so. Past performance information shall include information on corporate experience and past performance which clearly demonstrates that the offeror is capable of conforming to contractual requirements. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Past performance regarding minor members of joint ventures or teaming arrangements will be considered as highly as the majority member of those arrangements. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>b. The assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. Past performance evaluation is accomplished through the assignment of a confidence assessment rating based on assessing offeror's relevant past performance history focusing in and targeting performance that is relevant to the solicitation. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence as defined in Air Force FAR Supplement 5315.101-1 and MP 5315.305 (see the following table). Each proposal will be assigned one of the following performance confidence assessments. Note that these assessment ratings are subjective based on the past performance information collected.</p>
<p><br />PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS<br />Rating Description<br />SUBSTANTIAL<br />CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />SATISFACTORY<br />CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />LIMITED<br />CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />NO CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br />UNKNOWN<br />CONFIDENCE No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>c. Performance of the three lowest priced offers, with a passing technical rating, will be evaluated and receive a performance confidence assessment. If none of the three lowest priced offerors is judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision if the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance assessment.</p>
<p>d. The government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror, with a passing technical rating, if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of other than "Substantial". In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>e. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in Addenda To 52.212-1. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.<br /><br />(End of Provision)</p>

<p>(a) Mr Howard E. Marks Jr., ASC/AQH, has been appointed as Ombudsman. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendation to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.<br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

<p>H.21 CONSULTANTS<br /><br />A. Consultant(s) hired to perform under this contract may be compensated at a rate for time actually worked or at a fixed price for performance of a specific task, or at nominal compensation in accordance with the contractor's policies. Written approval from the Contracting Officer must be obtained before a consultant is hired, regardless of contract type (hourly or fixed price).</p>
<p>B. The amount or rate of payment shall be determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account the level and difficulty of the work to be performed, the qualifications of the expert or consultant, the pay rates of comparable individuals performing similar work in Federal or non-Federal sectors, and the availability of qualified candidates.</p>
<p>In no event shall a consultant's allowable rate for any one day exceed the daily equivalent of the highest rate payable under the General Schedule or, if warranted, the highest rate under the Senior Level pay schedule. For consultants hired under the General Schedule, the daily rate is computed by dividing the annual GS-15, step 10, rate (excluding locality pay) by 2087 hours to find the hourly rate of pay and multiplying the hourly rate of pay by 8 hours. Current General Schedule pay rates may be found on the Office of Personnel Management website at http://www.opm.gov/oca/08tables/indexGS.asp. The same method shall be used to determine the daily rate for consultants hired under the Senior Level pay schedule. The current Senior Level pay schedule may be found at: http://www.opm.gov/oca/08tables/indexSES.asp.</p>
<p>The daily rate is exclusive of travel and per diem cost which may be added to the allowable consultant's rate.</p>
<p>The contractor shall maintain a written report for the files of the results of all consultants charged to this contract. This report must include, as a minimum: (1) The consultant's name, dates, hours and amounts charged to the contract; (2) the names of the Contractor's staff to which the services are provided; and (3) the result of the subject matter of the consultation.</p>

<p>This service will be procured as a commercial item in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisition Procedures). The period of performance for the required maintenance agreement commences on 7 December 2011 and ends 6 December 2012 with four (4) one year options.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on very specific equipment that needs maintaining; The Genetic Analyzer 3500XL System is highly specialized in design and application requiring software and firmware updates and system components upgrades that are proprietary to the vendor. Applied Biosystems is the manufacturer of this system. The manufacturer is the only company that has specialized and technical knowledge as well as the necessary tools, manpower and repair parts to maintain this piece of equipment in an operable state. Another vendor was not located that had the technical and specialized knowledge and/or accessibility to repair parts for this system. Therefore Applied Biosystems is the one source reasonably available to meet the needs of the government.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quote. However, all interested parties may contact the Contract Specialist listed below. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can obtain/provide factory trained technicians and necessary replacement parts for the Genetic Analyzer 3500XL as specified above. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street., SW, JR11-0203 <br />Washington, DC 20593-0001 <br />Telephone 202.372.3692<br />Fax: 202.475-3904</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

<p><strong>H.21 CONSULTANTS<br /><br /></strong>A.&nbsp; Consultant(s) hired to perform under this contract may be compensated at a rate for time actually worked or at a fixed price for performance of a specific task, or at nominal compensation in accordance with the contractor's policies. Written approval from the Contracting Officer must be obtained before a consultant is hired, regardless of contract type (hourly or fixed price).</p>
<p>B. The amount or rate of payment shall be determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account the level and difficulty of the work to be performed, the qualifications of the expert or consultant, the pay rates of comparable individuals performing similar work in Federal or non-Federal sectors, and the availability of qualified candidates.</p>
<p>In no event shall a consultant's allowable rate for any one day exceed the daily equivalent of the highest rate payable under the General Schedule or, if warranted, the highest rate under the Senior Level pay schedule. For consultants hired under the General Schedule, the daily rate is computed by dividing the annual GS-15, step 10, rate (excluding locality pay) by 2087 hours to find the hourly rate of pay and multiplying the hourly rate of pay by 8 hours. Current General Schedule pay rates may be found on the Office of Personnel Management website at http://www.opm.gov/oca/08tables/indexGS.asp. The same method shall be used to determine the daily rate for consultants hired under the Senior Level pay schedule. The current Senior Level pay schedule may be found at: http://www.opm.gov/oca/08tables/indexSES.asp.</p>
<p>The daily rate is exclusive of travel and per diem cost which may be added to the allowable consultant's rate.</p>
<p>The contractor shall maintain a written report for the files of the results of all consultants charged to this contract. This report must include, as a minimum: (1) The consultant's name, dates, hours and amounts charged to the contract; (2) the names of the Contractor's staff to which the services are provided; and (3) the result of the subject matter of the consultation.</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>The Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI's Operations and Management Division in Washington provides OTI with an advanced level of operational and management support to help ensure ongoing and improved flexible, rapid response in political transition programming overseas. The Operations and Management Division is responsible for instituting and maintaining office-wide systems and processes, office practices and procedures, and the creation of an enhanced response capability through teamwork, responsiveness, fiscal responsibility, quality control, and customer service.</p>
<p>Within the Operations and Management Division, the Information and Technology Team (IT Team) is responsible for analyzing needs, developing solutions, and advising on issues related to business process and information management in direct support of OTI's numerous field programs. The IT team regularly participates in core DCHA/OTI process design, development and training exercises. The goal of the IT team is to create and maintain an enhanced response capability to support information management and effective processes for OTI field and Washington teams. The team accomplishes this through analyzing business process and information management needs in order to institute and maintain office-wide systems, processes, practices and procedures that support the overall mission of the office as well as address the needs of individual teams.</p>
<p>Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to hire a Software Engineer within OTI's Operations and Management Division (OMD). The Software Engineer will provide administrative support for program funded U.S. Personal Services Contract (USPSC) employees and program operations in OTI. The OTI Software Engineer will be supervised by the Chief, Operations Management Division or his/her designee, and will also work under the general guidance and direction of the relevant OTI Team Leader for specific assignments.</p>
<p>This is a key position in an exciting and busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations overseas. For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support. The Software Engineer has the ability to maintain flexibility in a fast-paced dynamic environment while managing competing priorities and meeting aggressive deadlines. Providing knowledgeable, rapid response using standard operating procedures and making recommendations for improvements or innovations to increase effectiveness and efficiency is critical to successful implementation of OTI's programs and fulfillment of OTI's mandate.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire a Software Engineer to provide support for program funded U.S. Personal Services Contract (USPSC) employees and program operations in OTI.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Washington, D.C. with possible travel as stated in the position description.</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>The Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI's Operations and Management Division in Washington provides OTI with an advanced level of operational and management support to help ensure ongoing and improved flexible, rapid response in political transition programming overseas. The Operations and Management Division is responsible for instituting and maintaining office-wide systems and processes, office practices and procedures, and the creation of an enhanced response capability through teamwork, responsiveness, fiscal responsibility, quality control, and customer service.</p>
<p>Within the Operations and Management Division, the Information and Technology Team (IT Team) is responsible for analyzing needs, developing solutions, and advising on issues related to business process and information management in direct support of OTI's numerous field programs. The IT team regularly participates in core DCHA/OTI process design, development and training exercises. The goal of the IT team is to create and maintain an enhanced response capability to support information management and effective processes for OTI field and Washington teams. The team accomplishes this through analyzing business process and information management needs in order to institute and maintain office-wide systems, processes, practices and procedures that support the overall mission of the office as well as address the needs of individual teams.</p>
<p>Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to hire a Software Engineer within OTI's Operations and Management Division (OMD). The Software Engineer will provide administrative support for program funded U.S. Personal Services Contract (USPSC) employees and program operations in OTI. The OTI Software Engineer will be supervised by the Chief, Operations Management Division or his/her designee, and will also work under the general guidance and direction of the relevant OTI Team Leader for specific assignments.</p>
<p>This is a key position in an exciting and busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations overseas. For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support. The Software Engineer has the ability to maintain flexibility in a fast-paced dynamic environment while managing competing priorities and meeting aggressive deadlines. Providing knowledgeable, rapid response using standard operating procedures and making recommendations for improvements or innovations to increase effectiveness and efficiency is critical to successful implementation of OTI's programs and fulfillment of OTI's mandate.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify 2 items.
<p>1. The contract shall be a severable seven year contract with various stand alone optional tasks. The option tasks should be budgeted as separate, stand-alone projects and may be exercised at any time that the Government decides.</p>
<p>2. The difference between tasks II.A.4 and II.A.5.within the SOW is that:<br />Item #II.A.4 is asking that the contractor update the supplement terms to be user friendly for respondents based on the underlying database. Thus #4 pertains to "list of dietary supplements."<br />Item #II.A.5 is asking that the contractor continually update to the most current NHANES supplement databases as they are published. Thus #5 pertains to "most up-to date supplement nutrient/component databases."</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to change the date of the forum from 12 December 2011 to 13 December 2011 in both the Special Notice Subject and in the attached GPO_RFI file.  

TO REGISTER FOR THIS EVENT, THE ATTACHED FILE GPO_IF_SUB_FORM.PDF MUST BE COMPLETED AND RETURNED TO DANIELLE.MAESTAS@NAVY.MIL AND theodore.fiske.ctr@navy.mil

The U.S. Navys Geothermal Program Office (GPO), as the lead office within the Department of Defense (DoD) for the exploration, development and management of geothermal energy resources on all DoD installations, has adopted an aggressive exploration philosophy aimed at identifying and assisting in the development of geothermal energy resources on military installations throughout the United States.
 As a step toward development of new geothermal resources, the GPO is requesting to host an Industry Forum for the purpose of eliciting information from the geothermal industry on the potential for future geothermal development on specified DoD properties; and further on the types of information that industry would require in order to make a reasoned judgment on the commercial viability of those and future unspecified properties. There is no specific contractual requirement related to this forum. Information acquired from contractors under the framework of the forum is for market research solely and may or may not be used in developing future contractual requirements. 

Through its exploration efforts, the GPO has acquired and analyzed a significant body of geological data on a number of potentially promising DoD properties.
 

The GPO has significant expertise in the geological analysis required in the location of potential geothermal sites but requires access to industry knowledge and expertise in the transition to energy production in todays marketplace. 

For the purposes of the forum the GPO will be providing available technical geological/geothermal data for the specified properties for review by industry prior to the event. Industry will be invited to engage the GPO in one-on-one discussions on a broad range of topics related to the process for transition between resource exploration and assessment to development and utilization. Potential topics might range from the types of geological/geothermal data the industry would find most beneficial in assessing economic viability of a site, to the different production technologies that might be appropriate to a site, or to the types of business arrangements that might be necessary in contracting for geothermal site development.

<DESC>The T-AKE Class vessels are presently plagued with a serious stern tube bearing wear issue that seriously affects the operation and reliability of the entire propulsion chain. These vessels were constructed by general Dynamics NASSCO under NAVSEA contract and delivered to MSC operation. To date, four of the 10 operating ships have succumbed to stern tube bearing failures. MSC technical (N7), MSC Norfolk N43C, NAVSEA, and the propulsion chain OEM (Wartsila) are working diligently to identify the root cause of these failures and a permanent fix, however owing to the complexity of these ships and the propulsion chain components, a permanent fix has yet to be identified and validated. Validation of a permanent fix may not be possible for many years, assessed through modification, monitoring and operation. Notwithstanding MSC requirements for use of OEM authorized technical representatives for critical shipboard equipment and systems, use of the OEM for the propulsion chain onboard the T-AKE vessels is critical to support the ongoing evaluation work. <br />The USNS PEARY is undergoing an emergency dry-docking in Trieste, Italy due to a C-4 CASREP on ship's stern tube assembly. The requested parts and services are critical to the successful repair of T-AKE Class stern tube and re-installation of ship's propeller and related systems. The propulsion system for the T-AKEs was designed and integrated with ship construction by Wartsila. Wartsila has sole possession of proprietary design data, material specifications, and components dimensions for shafting system components including thrust bearing, line shaft bearing, stern tube bearing, and tail shaft including tail shaft liners. <br />

Description of Action Being Approved</span></strong>: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This is a justification for other than full and open competition for digital signage technical support for the PDN - Pedestrian Reengineering project, El Paso, Texas.</p>

Identification of Statutory Authority</span></strong>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">The statutory reference authorizing this </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">action is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-5(b)(5), <span style="COLOR: black">Sole source awards under the HUBZone Act of 1997-15U.S.C.657a. </span>This acquisition is essential to the agency requirements because digital signage technical support is needed upon final acceptance, scheduled for October 7, 2011. <br /></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /><br />5. Demonstration that the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited</span></strong>:<br /><span style="COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><br />During a pre-final construction inspection of the PDN - Pedestrian Reengineering project, CBP requested, and it was determined by the GSA program manager that there is a need for one-year technical support for the new LED signage software program. GarCom Inc., a subcontractor for V&amp;R Construction, installed the software program and provided custom programming to the software to control the monitors; the system cannot be accessed remotely. The software signage program was designed by Omnivex, specifically for CBP and GarCom Inc. is the only licensed authorized distributor for Omnivex in the local El Paso area, and the technical support needed is specifically for Omnivex designed digital signage. Furthermore, in order not to void the warranty of the software, a licensed Omnivex technical support representative is required. GarCom Inc. has already provided training to CBP officers on the software system and is a certified HUBZone and Small Disadvantaged Business. <br /></span><br />Therefore, the contractor's unique qualifications and the nature of the acquisition stated above require the use of the authority cited. If sole sourcing is not used for the prompt procurement of the software technical support services provided by GarCom Inc., there is a greater risk that operational requirements would not be met. This will negatively impact CBP's mission.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

Demonstration that the Anticipated Cost will be Fair and Reasonable</span></strong>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is determined by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost for one-year technical support services for the new software program will be fair and reasonable. A price analysis of the proposed price will be conducted as compared to the independent government estimate prepared by the technical team, based on industry standard.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />8.

<p style="tab-stops: .25in">Upon the basis of the foregoing findings, I hereby determine that there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the above cited services will satisfy the agency's minimum needs and the services are only available from this source.</p>
