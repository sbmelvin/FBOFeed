<DESC>The Space and Missile Command GPS Program Office (SMC/GP) will be issuing a solicitation, FA8807-11-R-0002, to L3 for MGUE Increment 1 Technology Development. SMC/GP intends to award a sole source contract to L3 as one of only three responsible sources that has the necessary knowledge of GPS' next generation user equipment card technology. <br /><br />The MGUE contract was preceded by the Military User Equipment (MUE) contracts, awarded to three contractors, including L3. The Air Force spent over $460M for MUE, maturing the card technology. This contract will involve further development of the new GPS cards to be used in ground, air and maritime platforms, along with a common module for broader applications. These cards will be capable of receiving existing GPS signals along with the newer M-Code signal, which provides for increased security and jamming capabilities. The core technology, common to all the different cards, developed under MUE and to be continued on MGUE, is the Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), which must be procured through a specific trusted foundry. <br /><br />Extensive market research by the Air Force over the past 4 years has not yielded contractors outside of the 3 MUE incumbents who have demonstrated the ability to perform under MGUE. Award to others would result in large duplicative costs to the Air Force.

Dynamic Modeling of Seiche at AV Watkins Dam Resulting From Seismic Rupture of the Wasatch Fault.
Reclamation is seeking contract services to predict seiche waves and overtopping hazard at A. V. Watkins Dam, Utah, resulting from a large earthquake on the nearby Wasatch fault.  Topography and reservoir bathymetry (before the earthquake), and a range of ground-surface displacement scenarios will be given to the Contractor as input for the seiche wave modeling. Earthquake scenarios will be generated by Reclamation, and will specify a grid of ground surface displacements as a function of time in and around the reservoir. The Contractor will produce time histories of water surface elevation at various points on A. V. Watkins Dam for each of the ground-surface displacement scenarios, as well as overtopping flows.MethodologyA general-purpose hydrodynamics and transport model will be used, equal or similar to the River and Coastal Model (RICOM) (Walters and Casulli, 1998; Walters, 2004, Walters, 2005), which solves hydrodynamic problems where there is a lack of local mass conservation, and which provides stability and accuracy with advection-dominated flows. The methods to be used shall allow a uniform approach to modeling the reservoir in a coupled or uncoupled manner, be unconditionally stable with respect to time-step size, and must allow the time-step size to be controlled by the physics of the problem rather than numerical constraints.  Numerical models must employ a semi-Lagrangian approximation for advection that is accurate, stable and robust, yielding accurate results without oscillations for high-speed flows (such as over weirs, in flow constrictions and tidal rapids). The modeling approach must provide considerable flexibility in designing the computational grid, and allow for use of unstructured, staggered grid methods with a finite element spatial approximation (Walters et al, 2009). The elements chosen for the model shall have no spurious modes so that the solution is free of grid-scale oscillations (Walters, 1995). The model must accommodate a moving boundary to implement vertical surface displacement associated with faulting. (Walters, 2004)ReferencesWalters, R. A., 1995, Chapter 1: Modeling surface water flow, in Carey, G. F., ed., Finite Element Modeling of Environmental Problems: Wiley and Sons, New York, p. 1-16.Walters, R. A., and V.

<DESC>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PR#: 0042305108; 5962-01-298-3511. Approved source: Cirrus Logic Incorporated (60024) dba Apex Microtechnology P/N PA03; Microcircuit, Linear. The requirement is for a total quantity of 524 each with a 100% option to equal total quantity of 1084. Unit of Issue: Each. Destination information: to be shipped to New Cumberland, Pennsylvania. Delivery schedule: to be shipped within 250 days. This is an unrestricted procurement. All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered. The RFP will be available on the Internet at <a href="https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil">https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/rfp</a>&nbsp;on its issue date of 02/27/2012. Hard copies of this solicitation are NOT available. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307. The place of contract performance will be at DLA Land and Maritime, 3990 East Broad Street, Columbus Ohio 43218, United States of America.

<DESC>Market Survey Capability Assessment for Strategic Sourcing of Various Equipment and Supplies (SAVES).  Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Information Technology (IT) Software.
One of the major objectives in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Flight Plan is to control costs while delivering quality customer service.  To help achieve the Flight Plan of controlling costs, the FAA embarked on an Agency-wide strategic sourcing initiative called the Strategic Sourcing for the Acquisition of Various Equipment and Supplies (SAVES) Program.  The Program includes all FAA Lines of Business, Staff Offices, Regions, and Centers.  The objective of the SAVES Program is to enable the FAA to purchase selected commodities for less while maintaining or improving quality of purchases and our suppliers' service levels.  
The SAVES contract for COTS IT Software is nearing completion and the FAA is evaluating new strategies for one or more replacement contracts.  The FAA is requesting industry feedback before releasing any solicitations. 
Industry participation, while encouraged is strictly voluntary.  Failure to provide the requested information will not prevent a vendor from submitting a formal response to the FAA's release of a future SIR. 
In accordance with A.M.S. policy 3.2.1.2.1, the FAA is requesting information to aid in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside part or all of the competition for eligible, socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA)  for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and other small businesses or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement as a full and open competition.  The principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 423430 Computer and Computer Peripheral Equipment and Software Merchant Wholesalers with a size standard of 100 employees.  Suggestions to include other NAICS codes will be considered by the FAA.
                   SURVEY BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The FAA SAVES contracts currently utilize contract line items (CLINs) that aggregate manufacturers' products into categories or suites of products.  These categories are in direct relationship to the manufacturers' pricing to the resellers who hold the contracts.  For each of these categories the contractors are required to provide a minimum discount from manufacturer suggest retail price (MSRP).  Higher discounts for items on sale, at end-of-life, or for volume purchases are required on the contracts.  CLINs are also established for generalized professional services (e.g., training, installation) on a maximum rate per hour basis and for other direct costs (travel expenses, materials, etc.). 
The rationale for this way of structuring the contracts is to ease the administrative burden in maintaining CLINs for products by part numbers.  The contractor resellers are able to provide a wider range of products and can respond to frequent product changes.  Contract modifications are only required in response to changes in pricing from the manufacturers (OEMs) to the resellers or to their MSRPs.
As an example of this methodology, consider a fictitious software OEM called "ABC".  The following CLINs (simplified for this example) might be established on a SAVES contract with reseller "Acme": CLIN	OEM	DESCRIPTION	Acme's Minimum Discount from MSRP100	ABC	All new licenses, add-on licenses, upgrades and initial maintenance for the Security Systems product line	24.5%110	ABC	All software license maintenance renewals for the Security Systems product line	15.3%120	ABC	All new licenses, add-on licenses, upgrades and initial maintenance for the Data Management product line	28.0%130	ABC	All software license maintenance renewals for the Data Management product line	9.0%140	ABC	Fee charged to reinstate software maintenance, with no mark-up by the contractor	Cost is TBD per contract delivery order

The current SAVES contract for software includes:  Acronis, Adobe, Altova, Autodesk, BEA Systems, Inc. (division of Oracle), SAP (formerly Business Objects), Citrix, CA, Corel, EMC, Executive Software, Funk Software (owned by Juniper), Google, Hewlett-Packard, Jetbrains, McAfee, Microsoft, PGP (division of Symantec), Red Hat, RIM, Roxio (division of Sonic Solutions), RSA (division of EMC), SlickEdit, Symantec, Veritas, Trend Micro, IBM System Architect, and PKware.  It is anticipated that this list of OEMs will change in any future solicitations.  Possibilities for inclusion are Opnet, Liferay, Luciad, Tenable, Manage Engine and Tripwire.  In three years, the FAA has made purchases from the incumbent for some OEMs as low as $1,000.00 and as high as $4,000,000.  
Most software is shipped electronically and physical media is discouraged.  The FAA uses enterprise licenses for some software products (e.g., Microsoft) and some software is supported under existing SAVES hardware contracts.

The FAA requires the following preliminary information from interested vendors.
1.	Is your firm currently listed on the General Service Administration's Federal Supply Schedule 70?2.	Does your firm currently have a similar IT software contract with another agency of the Federal Government?  If yes, please provide the name, contract number, contract type and contract ceiling.3.	Is the CLIN structuring described above the most cost effective way of buying software?  If not, please provide information and examples that would illustrate a better methodology.4.	Would the greatest value to the FAA occur if multiple contracts were awarded?5.	Please identify and prioritize what criteria or key discriminators the FAA should consider in making any vendor down-select or award decisions.

<DESC>Z- AG-0356-S-12-0005 Blacktail Trails Construction <br /><strong>Project Location and Directions:</strong> The Blacktail Trails Construction Project is located in the Southern Snowcrests, a popular destination for hikers and stock users. Access is highly dependent on snowpack, and the trail might not melt out completely until mid-July. To get to the project from Dillon go east on the Blacktail Deer Creek Road. Follow the signs to East Fork Blacktail Campground. It&rsquo;s about 30 miles, and takes 1.5 hours. Park at the campground and follow the trail at the end of the campground. Hike up the BLM trail 1808 for approximately &frac12; mile to a creek crossing, ford the creek and continue on BLM until you reach a bear management sign. The Forest Service begins at the sign, and so does the trail work. Excavators may cross the Blacktail Deer Creek on BLM a maximum of 3 times per year. The BLM does not want dirt bikes or other motorized equipment crossing the creek for any reason. Fording Blacktail Deer Creek with a machine might be tricky early in the year. Excavators can also access the trail from the Notch. The Notch is a cabin located in the southern Snowcrests. To get to the Notch travel east from Dillon on Sweetwater Road. Kentucky Street turns into Sweetwater at the edge of town. Follow Sweetwater Road about 25 miles to a turnoff on your right. It is signed. Turn right towards the Notch and continue driving up to the cabin, almost 20 more miles. After the Notch cabin continue on the 2-track &ldquo;road&rdquo; to the actual Notch in the rocks and park. Hike &frac34; of a mile south to the end of the work at Honeymoon Park. Call the Madison Ranger District for directions. There are three trails in this project. Trail #1 is the mainline East Fork of Blacktail Deer Creek from the boundary to the junction with the Snowcrest Trail at Honeymoon Park. Trail #2 is the Two Meadows Trail. Two Meadows can be accessed off of the East Fork Trail approximately 5 miles from the beginning of the work. Trail #3 is the Lodgepole Trail. Lodgepole is signed at one of the creek crossings about 2 miles from the start of the project. The work on Lodgepole is very minimal. <br /><strong>Description of Work.</strong> The project consists of constructing almost 3 miles of new trail, reconditioning of 4 miles of existing trail, and one mile of route location of existing trail. Construction items include clearing and grubbing, turns, drainage structures, sign installation and puncheon construction. Stake refreshing and cleanup are required in this contract. The project is located mostly through sagebrush meadows. The main objective of this project is to pull the existing trail up onto sidehills and away from the creek.<br /><strong>Construction Magnitude</strong>&nbsp;is between $100,000 and $250,000.<br /><strong>Performance Period</strong> is 120 days from the issuance of the Notice to Proceed<strong>.</strong><br />

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE (NMFS) Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center Protected Species Division, has a requirement to assist the Hawaiian Monk Seal Research Program conduct field work, analyze and summarize data and report findings related to monk seal biology and ecology.
<p>The Hawaiian monk seal population is heading towards extinction with numerous threats afflicting the species across its range. The Hawaiian Monk Seal Research Program at the PIFSC conducts research to understand monk seal ecology, the threats to the population, and develop techniques to aid in the species recovery. Much of the work involves monitoring and identifying individual seals to determine survival, reproductive success, and other factors important for modeling population trajectories. These analyses allow researchers and managers to develop intervention and management strategies to help mitigate threats, enhance survival, and minimize human-seal conflicts.</p>
<p>The following services are anticipated to be ordered under this contract to assist the Hawaiian Monk Seal Research Program in its mission described above:<br />1. Data Analysis: The contractor will perform tasks associated with the compilation, statistical analysis, and interpretation of numerical data. <br />2. Simulation Modeling: A simulation model specific to the Hawaiian monk seal was developed through a collaborative effort between biologists with the Pacific Island Fisheries Science Center and researchers at Montana State University. The model is designed to represent the life history of the monk seal as realistically as possible, and to fully capture all of the uncertainties in demographic rates and system processes that influence the long-term dynamics of the population. It is intended as both an exploratory tool for management and a predictive tool to better understand the implications of current population trends and natural perturbations. To date, the model has been used to assist NMFS in a number of management decisions.<br />3. Technical Writing and Report Preparation: The contractor will provide assistance (or take the lead) in preparing written reports. These shall include, but are not limited to, reports describing the results from the analyses undertaken in item 1; internal documents related to monk seal biology or management; documents intended for the public or outside agencies summarizing monk seal data or management; documents related to the revised Monk Seal Recovery Plan (or other materials useful to the Monk Seal Recovery Team); and other documents as requested. The contractor may be asked to produce plots, figures, tables or other visual aids to be used in presentations or reports in preparation by other personnel. The contractor will provide assistance in summarizing data, providing simulation results of effects of proposed federal actions, justifying study design, or writing protocols to support permit applications or complete NEPA or other requirements that arise from the permit application process.<br />4. Study design of major program initiatives and program efficiency reviews: The contractor will work with the PIFSC staff and their partners to design research studies under the three main program initiatives (Population Assessment, Enhancement Activities, and Health Studies). The contractor will work with PIFSC staff to determine the optimal deployment strategy to maintain the long term monk seal population data set but maximize cost-effectiveness.<br />5. Computer Programming/Software Development: The contractor will develop computer programs and end-user software needed for monk seal data analysis or the monk seal research program. The contractor may also be asked to make recommendations for improving various aspects of the monk seal data collection and data management system.<br />6. Attendance at Meetings, Workshops, and Conferences: The contractor will attend scientific or public meetings and make presentations as requested. These meetings shall include, but are not limited to, the annual Monk Seal Recovery Team meeting, formal review committees, and special topic meetings relevant to monk seal biology and/or management. The contractor may be asked to travel to Honolulu to interact with members of the monk seal research team, or participate in special projects related to monk seal research and management.<br />7. Expert Consultation: The contractor will provide expert consultation on issues pertaining to monk seal conservation as requested by the contracting office. This will frequently involve technical review and editing of scientific manuscripts, reports and other documents produced by PIFSC and its collaborators. This task also includes any services requested by the contracting office that are not adequately described by the other tasks outlined in this Statement of Work.<br />8. Field work: Assist the Hawaiian monk seal in field research studies in the main Hawaiian Islands or at Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>Place of Performance: The Contractor will work remotely (away from PIFSC office) for this contract. The contractor will need to travel to Hawaii at least up to 2 weeks per year to meet with monk seal personnel and attend recovery team meetings. The contractor may also be sent to attend meetings elsewhere in the continental United States or abroad.</p>
<p>The estimated Period of Performance is 6/1/2012 - 5/31/2013, with potential option years:<br />OY1: 6/1/2013 - 5/31/2014<br />OY2: 6/1/2014 - 5/31/2015<br />OY3: 6/1/2015 - 5/31/2016</p>

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest (NAVFAC SW) is extending the current Northern California and Nevada 8(a) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA).  NAVFAC SW is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) "Developmental Stage" (first four years of the 8(a) program) construction firms with a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (Fresno, Sacramento, San Francisco, CA; and Las Vegas, NV) to participate in this BOA program.  CURRENT BOA HOLDERS DO NOT NEED TO REAPPLY FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs.  The estimated period of performance for the BOA will be one year with the government reserving the right to exercise options up to two additional years, with no single option exceeding one year, in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c).
  The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) Developmental Stage construction firms that are located in one of the four specified SBA Districts. The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement. Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract.
 Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed. If adequate competition cannot be obtained within the designated SBA District, the Government, upon SBA concurrence, reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent districts. The anticipated types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines), and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items).
 Only NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and 238 pertain to this BOA. Each firm will identify their primary NAICS code and a secondary NAICS code (if applicable). There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement; however, there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,500,000 per firm, per year. Any unused capacity in one year will not be carried over to the subsequent years. Individual task orders will range between $2,001 and $1,000,000. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety Letter (as applicable) with each proposal over $30,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each order. Annually the Navy and the SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of a) usefulness and need for service and b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.
 The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program through the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov) for new entrants once a year for each region. Task orders will not be advertised. Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly. No new orders will be issued to the Contractor and this agreement will terminate. Termination of the BOA under these circumstances shall have no effect on any orders previously issued. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification.
 This agreement may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation. Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the Navy may continue to place orders under the BOA. Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA. Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either eligible or ineligible. To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm must meet all the following criteria: (1) Be a certified 8(a) Developmental Stage participant prior to the submission date of April 10, 2012 and still be certified as an 8(a) Developmental Stage participant at the time of award; have a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (Fresno, Sacramento, San Francisco, CA; and Las Vegas, NV); (2) Be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov/, including the new SBA Dynamic Small Business Listing; Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov/; and VETS-100 at http://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/fcp/main.htm (if not applicable, provide a statement that the firm has not had contracts subject to this requirement); (3) Be licensed/bonded and fully capable to perform construction work within a range of $2,001 - $1,000,000; and (4) Demonstrate technical experience/past performance (including safety) of similar size, general scope, and complexity of construction project(s) under NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and/or 238 within the last three years.

After carefully reviewing the submittal requirements checklist to ensure compliance, please submit your package via email to laurel.colon@navy.mil and redna.fork@navy.mil or to NAVFAC Southwest, Attn: Laurel Colon/Redna Fork, Code RAQ20, 1220 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92132, not later than 2:00 PM Pacific time on April 10, 2012.

<p>&nbsp;The Mission's proposed project will assist farmers and firms to increase trade in key grains and livestock in line with the regional trade goals that are presented in the <span>USAID/West Africa Feed the Future strategy (<a href="http://www.feedthefuture.gov/sites/default/files/country/strategies/files/WestAfricaRegionalFTFMulti-YearStrategy.pdf">USAID/WA FTF Strategy</a>)</span>.

More information on the Trade Hub project activities can be found at <a href="http://www.watradehub.com/">http://www.watradehub.com/</a> and for ATP/E-ATP projects activities can be found at <a href="http://www.agribizafrica.org/">http://www.agribizafrica.org/</a>. USAID/West Africa's Trade Hub Network Contract will increasingly rely on African Partners, i.e. regional associations and organizations, private and public, to make progress in addressing constraints to private sector development and the agri-business enabling environment through complementary USAID direct grants and sub-grants under contract.</p>

<DESC>The contract to be awarded will be a 49.5 Million Dollar, 5 year Single Award Task Order IDIQ Contract (SATOC) for Design-Build and Construction Services in support of various military and civil works construction projects within the boundaries of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Tulsa District, to primarily support locations within the Fort Sill Area Office. The RFP will be a total small business set-aside and should be available on or ABOUT February 24, 2012. The sole Point of contact for this acquisition is Nathan Kloeckler at Nathan.R.Kloeckler@USACE.ARMY.MIL. This contract is intended for multi-tasking of construction services for a wide variety of new construction, maintenance, repair, alteration and minor and major construction type tasks for military and civil works projects primarily for the Fort Sill Area Office to specifically include Fort Sill (Oklahoma), Sheppard Air Force Base (Texas), and Altus Air Force Base (Oklahoma). This contract will mainly serve military customers at these installations. The tasks include, but are not limited to, planning, design, total facility renovation, new construction; repairs and alterations; preventive maintenance; installation/construction of the following systems: HVAC, plumbing, electrical, elevators, building envelope, road and pavements, fire protection, antiterrorism/force protection (ATFP); environmental abatement, utility system modifications, and operations activities. This contract is intended to execute new construction, design-build or construction of real and personal property facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-based paint abatement, and major and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, architectural, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, telecommunications, and ATFP.<br>This contract will support customers that historically fund Operation and Maintenance (O&M) projects during the last quarter of each FY.  Approvals to proceed with applicable funding are not provided until this last quarter, thus requiring the Corps of Engineers to sole-source projects through a SATOC contractor on a very limited time frame.  These contractors must possess and have demonstrated a high level of experience, capability, and technical expertise in a myriad of construction skills to include project, design, quality, risk, and construction management.  The contractor must possess the knowledge and resource base to quickly react and meet the needs of the customers under very short timeframes.  This is compounded by the fact that every task order issued to this SATOC contractor is different in scope and will require the contractor to plan and approach each project differently.  <br>It is imperative that the contractor that supports the government under the SATOC has the experience and proven ability to execute mission critical projects on an extremely tight timeline and have the bonding capacities required.   <br>

<SUBJECT>Replacement of Components for an Omicron NanoTechnology Ultra-High Vacuum Scanning Tunneling Microscopy System
<SOLNBR>AMD-12-SS15
<RESPDATE>021612
<CONTACT>Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8448, Email paula.wilkison@nist.gov - Patrick Staines, Contracting Officer, Phone (301)975-6335, Email patrick.staines@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a drop-in replacement for an integrated Omicron NanoTechnology STM control system and a direct bolt-on UHV T STM XA 650 microscope, which will directly replace an integrated UHV-1 microscope for an extensive existing Omicron NanoTechnology ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy system.
<p>The required STM control system (computer, electronics and software) will be able to seamlessly replace NIST's existing Omicron NanoTechnology STM control system, and will be able to control an Omicron NanoTechnology UHV STM-1 and an Omicron NanoTechnology UHV AFM-STM microscope, in addition to the new UHV VT STM XA 650 microscope with no need for additional customization.</p>
<p>The required UHV VT STM XA 650 microscope will be a direct bolt-on replacement for an existing Omicron NanoTechnology "UHV-1" microscope. The required microscope will provide for a substantial improvement in the tip lateral scan range, provide for three coarse directions of motion instead of two and allow the sample to be studied at a range of temperatures from 300 K - 650 K. Further, this platform will also allow for future upgrades for cooling to 50 K and force microscopy, i.e., AFM, MFM, etc. The required microscope must be compatible with both the STM control system (which must also be capable of controlling our other existing microscopes, the Omicron NanoTechnology UHV STM-1 and Omicron NanoTechnology UHV AFM-STM) and the substantial existing UHV equipment that is currently deployed on the system and engineered specifically for the sample and tip handling systems specific to Omicron NanoTechnology. Specifically, the UHV system that the required microscope will be attached to has sample preparation equipment, sample deposition equipment, tip preparation equipment, sample and tip transfer systems for moving either around, and a load-lock system for introducing new tips or samples that are all engineered for use with Omicron NanoTechnology style sample "platens."</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the replacement of components for the Omicron NanoTechnology ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy system, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies capable of replacement of components for the Omicron NanoTechnology ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy system are requested to email a detailed report describing their capabilities to paula.wilkison@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:<br /><br />1. Name of the company that provides the components for which specifications are provided.<br /><br />2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to provide the components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).<br /><br />3.

<CONTACT>Terry Gotter, 407-380-4338

<a href="mailto:terry.gotter@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>Scope of Market Survey:  HITS is comprised of two subsystems, a data processing and presentation subsystem known as Exercise control (EXCON), and an Instrumentation Communication Subsystem (ICS). This market survey is only applicable for the ICS. The EXCON subsystem is currently being procured via a separate contract. <br><br>EXCON System Description<br>Home Instrumentation Training Systems (HITS) is a training device that provides to U.S. Army units at their home stations many of the training enablers previously only available at the Maneuver Combat Training Centers. It is an integrated system of computer software and hardware; workstations; databases; voice, video, and data recording, production, and presentation equipment; interface devices; and communication networks. It provides the tools for the Observer/Controllers (O/C) and Operators to collect, analyze, and present training performance feedback to the training unit in the After Action Review (AAR) and Take Home Package (THP).  <br><br>ICS Description<br>The ICS consists of the communication infrastructure, Radio Frequency (RF) link, and/or ICS gateway to support HITS. The ICS provides the data interface and bidirectional communication network between the EXCON and vehicles and personnel equipped with Tactical Engagement Simulation Systems (TESS) that are compliant to the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) standards. The ICS consists of light deployable communication infrastructure that can be rapidly assembled and disassembled, and transported to support field training exercises.  <br><br>Basic Scope of work for the ICS <br>a.	This effort supports the HITS program in the Production and Deployment acquisition phase of the ICS subsystem requirement only.  The focus is on interfaces and design, production, unit and System Verification & Validation (V&V), Configuration Management (CM), Technical Data Package (TDP) and shipping of the network infrastructure and radio player units, individual and vehicle mounting kits, logistic data, spares manuals, New Equipment Training (NET), and system production support.<br><br>The anticipated Threshold and Objective requirements and/or technical points to discuss for the ICS market survey can be found in Attachment A.  These requirements may change in the official Request for Proposal (RFP) that may be issued.  <br> <br> <br>ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government, U.S. Army PEO STRI is conducting this market survey to determine the most advantageous acquisition approach to procuring the ICS subsystem in support of the HITS program.  <br><br>The goal is to maximize the competitive base and determine the best acquisition strategy to leverage proven COTS and/or Non Developmental Item (NDI) communication infrastructure to the greatest extent possible in order to minimize engineering implementation.  The Government's intent is to procure a proven NDI and/or COTS data radio system with a supporting infrastructure that has growth potential and will eliminate obsolescent issues for post deployment support.  Of key interest to the Government is a mobile communication system infrastructure, a reliable Radio Frequency (RF) link, and/or gateway to support the Home Station Instrumentation System (HITS).   It is strongly desired that the RF communication infrastructure and RF link be an already proven product.<br><br>The following are fundamental requirements that are anticipated to be found in a RFP:<br><br>A.	The prime contractor shall be responsible for furnishing an existing and proven RF infrastructure and working data communication RF link at a minimum to the base station and network controller/administrator workstation prior to GPS and MILES data interfacing to the gateway.    <br><br>Note: See Appendix B for the description of the generic end to end system that consists of the following types of components and/or responsibilities and compliance ICDs that need to be implemented. <br><br>B.	The prime contractor at a minimum shall comply with the software message protocol (sequence, timing, and format) electrical and mechanical interfaces as described in the MILES ICDs between the radio and TESS vehicle Platform and manworn.  This can be done in house by the prime or subcontracted for the appropriate skill set. <br>  <br>C.	The prime contractor of the ICS gateway shall comply with PU   CTIA Common message set ICD, version 1.1.  The gateway transforms the messages from the Radio GPS and MILES between the Gateway and PU controller according to the PU   CTIA Common message set ICD, version 1.1. The PU controller and EXCON is a Government furnished collection of software.  The Government realizes that RF companies that have proven RF communication systems to transfer data in a military or civilian public safety environment may not have extensive MILES-gateway experience may rather have this challenging task in a separate contract for the government to achieve the proper skill set. If the Government decides to have a separate contract to implement the gateway there is no restriction for bidding for the RF infrastructure communication link and the gateway contract.  <br><br>QUANTITIES:  The total number of systems to be fielded is currently estimated to be 19. The required fielding date for the First Unit Equipped (FUE) is currently projected to be 4Q13.  After FUE, required fielding is expected to be at a rate of one system per quarter/four per year for FY14-17.<br><br>ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  The estimated funding for all systems, including options, is $130M.<br><br>RESPONSES REQUIRED:  <br><br>Responses shall be limited to 25 pages or less including all attachments.   If a detailed analysis of all elements within Attachment A is not feasible, all information should be addressed at least as a declaration of capability.  Each of the following items should be addressed:<br><br>a.	To ensure maximum competition the government is inquiring about the acquisition strategy (see Acquisition Approach paragraph C).  The government would like to know if there are RF companies that would like to enter this domain without being responsible for the software gateway implementation of the ICDs to promote entry into this area of live training devices.  <br><br>Note:  If your company is interested in this type of potential RFP but will not be submitting a formal Sources Sought response please let the Contract POCs know the following: <br><br>o	Name of the company <br>o	scope of interest <br>o	Comment about the acquisition strategy and what facilitates your entry into this domain?   <br> 	RF Prime with or without gateway implementation responsibility<br> 	Gateway code that would be government owned verse General Purpose Rights (see Attachment C)<br><br>b.	Describe key technical characteristics of the item and how the item meets the needs of the Army as stated in this Sources Sought. See Attachment A for the capabilities that are currently anticipated to be required.  These requirements may be modified as part of the RFP.<br><br>c.	Evidence that the item has been fielded.  To verify that the vendor's Range System has supported 1,000 or more participants in a Live Collective Training Exercise, vendors shall include in their response:<br><br> 	US or foreign Government point of contact for verification<br> 	A list of locations and dates  <br> 	Network characteristics: <br>o	Number of base stations<br>o	Size of training area<br>o	Percent coverage of training area<br>o	Quantity and types of player units<br>o	Time Space Position Information (TSPI) reporting rates and Real Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA) data<br>o	Quality of service information such as packet loss, GPS loss<br>o	Spectrum usage<br> 	Description of use case<br> 	Types of Tactical Engagement Simulation System (TESS) used <br><br><br>d.	Business Size:  Indicate Business Size.  If other than large business, identify the specific category of small business (i.e., Small Business, 8(a), Woman Owned, Disabled Veteran, etc). All small businesses should provide an explanation of how you intend to meet the limitations on subcontracting per FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on  Subcontracting.  If you are only interested in subcontracting opportunities, please be specific in identifying the areas you are interested in supporting.<br><br><br>Responses should NOT include the following type of information:<br><br>a.	 Company history.<br>b.	Detailed descriptions of corporate structure.<br>c.	Other information of a general nature, that is not specifically and directly relevant to the acquisition at hand.<br><br>DISCLAIMER: This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products. <br><br>Contracts POCs: <br><br>Terry Gotter, Contract Specialist - 407-380-4338, terry.gotter@us.army.mil<br><br>Lisa Parker, Contracting Officer - 407-380-4054, lisa.c.parker@us.army.mil <br>	<br>

<a href="mailto:tuan.doan@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>Unattended Ground Sensor fordifferentiation and detecting ofHumans versus Animals.***A copy of the entire Request forInformation (RFI) can be reviewed athttps://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil/1.0 Request for Information1.1 IntroductionThe Department of the Navy, Spaceand Naval Warfare Systems CenterPacific, is seeking information on theavailability of software/hardwareassociated with Unattended GroundSensors (UGS) for classifying humansfrom animals. UGS sensors used forperimeter/border security currentlyemploy seismic, non-imaging PassiveInfra Red (PIR), acoustic, or magneticsensors. Unauthorized personnelwalking through or across theperimeter can be detected by theseismic, PIR, or acoustic sensors.However, these same sensors can betriggered by medium to large sizeanimals (deer, burro, moose, livestock,etc). The classification capability todistinguish between humans andanimals may involve software thatwould work with existing UGS sensors,hardware additions that would makeexisting sensors more capable, or newsensors. Any modifications to the UGSpackage for reliable classificationshould not raise the cost of currentgeneration of UGS nodes significantly.For example, the incorporation of anexpensive infrared camera into an UGSsystem (with transmission of imageryof a detected object) that significantlyincreases the system cost, does notmeet the intent for this RFI.Sources able to satisfy the capabilitiesbelow are invited to submit informationdescribing their capability. Thesubmittal will include as a minimum:1) A description of the enhanced UGSsystem that clearly identifies, (i) wherenon developmental items would beutilized, (ii) where modification toexisting items are required, and (iii)where new developmental items arerequired.2) Expected performance ofhardware/software for detecting andclassifying humans versus animals thatwalk by the UGS system.3) Theoretical analysis and/or testresults that validate the classificationconcept4) Any environmental or terrainconditions that might affect or limit thedetection and classificationperformance.5) Cost and schedule estimates forprototype UGS nodes with classificationof humans from animals.1.2 RFI OperationsCurrent UGS systems deployed forperimeter security normally contain asensor/sensors subsystem to detectthe presence of an object in theimmediate area, a communicationssubsystem for reporting the presenceof an object in the area, a powersubsystem, and a control subsystem.The UGS system is typically buried withonly the antenna for communicationsand in some cases the sensors (PIR,acoustic) exposed above ground.Prerequisites for an UGS system to besuccessful are to be covert and toconsume low average power for a longlifetime. Changes to an UGS system topermit classification of humans fromanimals or other sources should impactthe covertness and lifetime of the UGSsystem as little as possible. This RFIdoes not intend to limit the approachesused for classifying humans from othersources that trigger an UGS sensor.The classification approach mayinvolve:- Signal processing approaches usedwith existing sensors- Data fusion approaches that may useinformation from multiple UGS in ageographical area or multiple sensortypes employed with a single UGSsystem- Modifications to existing sensor types(seismic, PIR, acoustic) that willprovide additional information thatpermits classification of humans- New sensor types that allow forhuman classification1.3 Performance FeaturesIt is desired that the enhanced UGSsystem be able to:1. Detect: humans walking at rangesconsistent with or better than current,conventional, UGS sensor capability (25meters or greater for seismic and PIR)2. Classification: human versus non-human at 90% reliability for eventsthat may trigger the UGSsensor/sensors as to the presence of amoving object in the immediatevicinity; higher signal to noise ratiorequirements may decrease theclassification range from the detectionrange but it is expected that theclassification range will be at least 75%of the detection range3. Environment: Operate in allenvironmental conditions typicallyencountered in the North Americancontinental region4. System Lifetime: Will not degradesystem lifetime substantially fromcurrent UGS configurations and that aminimum lifetime of 1 year on batteryis feasible5. UGS Node Costs: As a goal, theclassification capability should notincrease the cost of current generationof UGS nodes (in production) by morethan ~25%.2.0 Responding to This RFI2.1 General Guidelines White papers should be no morethan thirty (30) pages in lengthincluding any and all appendices andattachments. Submissions must be received nolater than 5:00 PM, U.S. EasternStandard Time, 02 MARCH 2012. Any company proprietary information,performance capabilities and/or futuremodification plans should be clearlyidentified and marked. Companies are solely responsible forany and all expenses incurred pursuantto responding to this RFI. This RFI is issued solely for purposesof conducting market research anddoes not constitute any current orfuture commitment by theGovernment. No contract will beawarded under this RFI. Unsolicited proposals in response tothis RFI will not be considered. Provide any input on price or desiredprice.2.2 Content of SubmissionsOne electronic submission in machine-readable format (typically PDF, ASCII,or MS Word format) should be sentelectronically to the SPAWAR PACIFICContract Specialist: Tuan Doan attuan.doan@navy.mil

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers, Huntington District, is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for a large scale construction project (exceeding $25 million) within the Hinton, WV area. The project consists of installing 278 high capacity multi-strand rock anchors.  The majority of the anchors will be 61 strands and up to 270 feet in length.  <br><br>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). <br><br>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:<br><br>a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <br>b. The complexity of the project. <br>c. Shortage of skilled labor in region. <br>d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br>e. The use of PLAs on other comparable projects. <br>f. The promotion of the Governments long term program interests, such as training of skilled workforce for future projects. <br>g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. <br>h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive. <br><br>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. <br><br>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<br><br>The construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br><br>a. Should a PLA be executed on the Dam Safety Assurance, Phase 4, Bluestone Dam, Hinton, WV Project? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in the contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?<br><br><br>b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?<br><br>c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? <br><br>d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts? <br><br>e. The project will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades.  Do you foresee any work on the project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? <br><br>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics. <br><br>g. Completion of the anticipated project will require an extensive performance period. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br><br>h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? <br><br>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br><br>Responses shall be submitted via email to Heather Keeling at heather.d.keeling@usace.army.mil no later than 1:00 PM Eastern Time (EDST) on 21 February 2012.<br>This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey.<br><br><br><br>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: 
This notice requests information from interested potential sources on behalf of the Department of Veterans Affairs Acquisitions Academy (VAAA).  The request is for information only, and your response is not an offer/quote. This request for information does not commit the VA to pay any costs incurred in the preparation and submission of your response to this sources sought request. Also, this does not obligate VA to contract for services or guarantee your inclusion on a potential solicitation mailing list.
VAAA has a potential requirement for a training evaluation product and necessary services to implement a competency based integrated human capital system. The primary focus is for an off-the-shelf product and consulting services to assist the VAAA in its implementation.
VAAA is particularly interested in capabilities related to performance management including 360 degree reviews, selection including assessment centers, employee development, leadership development and succession planning. It is important for VAAA to understand the market availability for comprehensive training evaluation programs in each of these areas and the design of these programs needs to be integrated across the offerings (i.e. the structure of the performance management program needs to seamlessly integrate with the structure and training support of the selection system program). The training needed to support these systems needs to be both classroom and electronically based and the systems also need to be supported by a technology solution. Once implemented, the performance management system should have an available information technology support system for day to day administration or be able to integrate to an existing system. Vendor must be able to develop, implement, and sustain an evaluation system framework. This framework will directly support the achievement of VAAA goals tied to business results and drive near and long term outcomes supporting the Academy's mission.
BACKGROUND
The VA Acquisition Academy (Academy), housed within the Office of Acquisition & Logistics (OAL), is a critical component of developing best-in-class acquisition talent and preparing it to address the growing acquisition workforce challenges facing the VA and the Federal Government. 

The academy opened in the fall of 2008 in Frederick, Maryland. This is the first acquisition academy in a civilian government agency, which was created in response to the growing acquisition workforce challenge 

The Talent Development Reporting Principles framework clearly aligns organizational data with evaluation data. Data stovepipes should be avoided and good Knowledge Management practices need to be employed to make data access fast, easy and efficient. Providing access to valid and reliable analysis of data is critical in demonstrating the value of training and development investments. Not only should regular reporting be conducted but also having the ability to conduct further analysis when needed. Often data is required to support many different aspects of business operations, thereby creating added value for the organization.

INFORMATION AND INPUT REQUESTED
If your firm is interested in this potential requirement, you are requested to submit the following information via e-mail to steve.wilson4@va.gov. Please do not exceed twenty pages. However, your firm may submit any pre-created marketing literature to supplement your response.

1. Company Information. Vendors shall provide a summary about their company. Included in the summary will be:
a. Company name and address
b. Years in business
c. Type of company
d. Point of contact with phone number and email, representing the interested firm.
2. Functional Overview. Vendors shall provide a description of their off-the-shelf product available including examples of the effectiveness of the product in other organizations.

3. Public/Private Sector Experience. Vendors shall provide a summary of how their product has been successfully implemented in both the private and public sectors.

4. Technology Support. Vendors shall provide information regarding how technology tools are used in both the training and day to day administration of the product requested.

<DESC>THIS SPECIAL NOTICE IS BEING RELEASED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND SERVES TO BENEFIT THE GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY. THE GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR BEST PRACTICES AND INDUSTRY FEEDBACK TO INCLUDE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS REGARDING THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. THE m-FoCS REQUIREMENT WILL BE SOLICITED ON A FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION BASIS IN A FUTURE ANNOUNCEMENT UNDER THE SOLICITATION NUMBER W15P7T-12-R-0001.<br><br>DRAFT VERSIONS OF THE PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT AND PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION FOR THE m-FoCS HAVE BEEN ATTACHED FOR REVIEW AND COMMENT. THE GOVERNMENT WILL ACCEPT INDUSTRY FEEDBACK AND/OR QUESTIONS FOR TEN (10) CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE POSTING OF THIS SPECIAL NOTICE. ALL QUESTIONS WILL BE ANSWERED BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT LATER THAN TEN (10) CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE CLOSING PERIOD FOR SUBMISSION OF FEEDBACK.      <br><br>The Army's modernization effort of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) has introduced a multitude of new and improved Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) equipments that will enhance the soldier's ability to plan, monitor, communicate and execute the mission. Each C4ISR system designed their own unique hardware to meet its stated operational requirement / mission. Installation of these C4ISR systems into command and control vehicles has become difficult due to space restrictions. Multiple Processors, Displays, Input/output and communications devices and installations kits within a command vehicle have reached the saturation point. The Size, Weight, Power and overall Cost (SWAP-C) involved with duplication of computing hardware for all these C4ISR systems is a major concern. The m-FoCS hardware (referred to as Mission Command Common Computing Platform (MC3P) in prior presolicitation announcements) is a means to alleviate these concerns.<br>

<DESC>EXPRESS - The Next Generation<br>(EXP-TNG)<br><br>The U. S. Army Contracting Command-Redstone (ACC-R) is considering an update the Expedited Professional and Engineering Support Services (EXPRESS) Program.  The EXPRESS Program provides the full gamut of advisory and assistance services to the U. S. Army Missile Command (AMCOM) and its customers.  The purpose of this announcement is to invite comments/recommendations for updates to the program as it currently operates.  <br>	<br>The EXPRESS Program consists of a group of 27 Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) set up against Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) primes in accordance with FAR 8.404(b)(4).  Four domains are currently being utilized in the EXPRESS program; Business & Analytical (B&A), Logistics (LOG), Programmatic (PROG) and Technical (TECH).  EXPRESS Primes are required to hold at least one of the following schedules:  871 - Professional Engineering Services (PES); 874V - Logistics Worldwide (LOGWORLD); 874 - Management, Organizational and Business Improvement Services (MOBIS); 70 - Information Technology Services and Support (IT); and Corporate Schedules with applicable Special Item Numbers (SINs) from PES, LOGWORLD, MOBIS or IT.<br><br>Under the current program, the B&A domain is reserved for small business Primes.  The LOG, PROG, and TECH domains were competed on a full and open basis, with the preponderance of the BPAs in each domain reserved for small business.  The program was established in 2005, with a total of 16 BPA awards, and was expanded in 2009 with the award of an additional 15 small business reserve BPAs.  With the graduation of 4 BPA holders from the program in January 2012, there are currently 4 in B&A, 6 in LOG, 6 in PROG, and 11 in TECH.  <br><br>The application of NAICS under the current program is as follows:  If MOBIS or LOGWORLD is identified as the primary schedule, the NAICS Code and business size standard assigned to the respondent's schedule by GSA will apply.  If PES is identified as the primary schedule, NAICS 541330 and a size standard of $27M, will apply to the Business & Analytical, Logistics and Programmatic Domains and NAICS 541712 and a size standard of 1,000 employees will apply to the Technical Domain.  If IT is identified as the primary schedule, NAICS 541511/541512/ 541513, and a size standard of $25M, will apply to all domains.  If the Consolidated Products and Services Schedule is identified as the primary schedule, the primary SIN covered by this schedule (PES, MOBIS, LOGWORLD, or IT) that will be used to satisfy the majority of domain requirements must also be identified.  The NAICS and size standard for the primary SIN, as identified above, will then apply.  <br><br>You may submit comments/recommendations for program updates in two copies, on CD-ROM, to the following address:  U.S. Army Contracting Command, CCAM-EX-P/Marcia N. Tully or Donna Pearson, Bldg 5303, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-0890	<br />Name:		Copy Paper, 8.5 x 11, 100% Recycled, Reamless 2500 Sheet Convenience Pack<br />Description:	Convenience pack copy paper, 2500 sheets per carton, 100% recycled post-consumer waste (PCW), bulk packed (no ream wrappers). FSC Certified, multi-purpose, 20 pound basis weight, acid-free, letter-sized, white, precision trimmed, and 92 Brite. UoI is BX. BX = 2500 sheets.</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-0891<br />Name:		Copy Paper, 8.5 x 11, 100% Recycled, Ream Wrapped 2500 Sheet Convenience Pack<br />Description:	Convenience pack copy paper, 2500 sheets per carton, 100% recycled post-consumer waste (PCW), with ream wrappers, 5 reams/BX. FSC Certified, multi-purpose, 20 pound basis weight, acid-free, letter-sized, white, precision trimmed, and 92 Brite. UoI is BX. BX = 5 reams.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-0890	<br />Similar Items:	None Reported</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-0891<br />Similar Items:	None Reported</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 24, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<CONTACT>Amanda Gilbert, Contract Specialist, Phone (571)468-7005, Email amanda.gilbert@dhs.gov
<DESC><p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This is an RFI released pursuant to FAR 15.201(e). This RFI is issued solely for information, planning purposes, and market research only; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is not at this time seeking proposals. CBP will not pay for any cost associated with responding to this RFI. All costs will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP. If a solicitation is released, it will be posted in the Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fbo.gov). Interested parties are advised to monitor this website for any information that may pertain to this RFI. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government, and will not be returned.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>This RFI seeks to obtain information from industry that will provide CBP with insight into existing technology that can be fielded now as well as technological advances that might be expected in the near future (3-8 years out). RFI responses will aid in the formation of an acquisition strategy for technology solutions required to address all CBP mission areas. These mission areas include: screening of passengers and conveyances for contraband at ports of entry; intelligence collection and analysis; and supporting functions such as officer safety and training. This is a partial listing. A more complete listing is provided as Potential User Needs in Appendix A, Definitions in Appendix B.</p>
<p>To address this planning, CBP is creating a Technology Development Roadmap (Tech Roadmap) that captures the Potential User Needs of all CBP operational components, assesses the capability of existing and near term technology to meet those Potential User Needs, and identifies all gaps between them.</p>
<p>Once established, this Tech Roadmap will help guide CBP's future acquisitions and support new product development. It will identify which Potential User Needs can be met immediately with Off-the-Shelf products, which solutions would have the greatest impact on the mission once implemented, and which projects require further development.</p>
<p>In order to effectively populate the Tech Roadmap, information is needed from industry that allows us to assess the state of the technology readiness level of products that may be able to fulfill the Potential User Needs of CBP.</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this Special Notice is to synopsize the Government's intent to award a firm-fixed price bridge contract for the continuation of bus lease with maintenance services on a sole source basis to Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation. <br /><br />The proposed contract action is for services for which DoDEA Pacific intends to solicit without providing for other than full and open competition under FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source as the unusual and compelling urgency of this requirement precludes competition to the maximum extent practical.<br /><br />The current contract expires 31 March 2012. However, the anticipated award date for the new requirement is 1 Aug 2012, leaving a 5-month break in service. Therefore, a 5-month bridge contract is necessary to provide uninterrupted bus lease services until the follow-on contract can be awarded. The anticipated award date for the bridge contract is 1 March 2012 with a period of performance from 1 Mar 2012 -31 July 2012. <br /><br />The proposed bridge contract action is for the lease of 75 school buses and 5 tour buses, a total of 80 buses with full maintenance service. The required bus passenger sizes are as follows: 5 each forty-six passenger Tour Buses, 55 each fifty-three Passenger School Buses, 4 each forty-four Passenger School Buses, 11 each eighteen Passenger School Buses, and 5 each fourteen Passenger School Buses (with an internal wheel chair lift and capability to transport 2 wheelchair bound students). The contractor shall provide for emergency towing services in the event of break-downs. The contractor shall ensure that all buses and services provided meet all applicable Government of Japan (GOJ) motor vehicle laws and regulatory guidance.</p>

<DESC>RFI 12-0020<br />Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Warstopper Program<br />Request for Information (RFI)
<p>1. Contracting Office Address<br />Defense Contracting Services Office Philadelphia, 700 Robbins Avenue, Bldg 26-1N-8115, Philadelphia, PA, 19111.</p>
<p>2. General Information<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e), to obtain information for planning purposes. This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Further, DSCO-P is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that DLA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation. There is no bid package or solicitation at this time. All information received shall be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>3. General Intent<br />The purpose of the Warstopper Program is to ensure maintenance of "Those resources required for all plans, actions, or measures necessary to establish and maintain an industrial base, both government-owned and privately-owned, that is required to support current, wartime, or other contingency military requirements." The scope of the Warstopper Program includes all sectors of the industrial base necessary to support the Department of Defense (DoD) with manufacturing capabilities sufficient to meet increased requirements during wartime and contingency operations. <br />The Warstopper Program seeks to establish partnerships with raw material suppliers that support prime or sub-tier suppliers of DLA or DoD contracts to ensure that the industrial base is prepared to respond to the Military Services' increased demand for items designated as critical during times of mobilization, war, contingency and military or other operations. Rather than purchasing raw material, the Government is interested in contracting for the services of contractors to build and manage buffer inventories to be made available for the Government's needs. The intent would be to rotate the inventory through the fulfillment of orders to authorized value chain partners as identified by the government. The Warstopper Program seeks this initial information for the purpose of structuring future competitive solicitations related to raw material buffers to support go-to-war items.<br />Questions of consideration:<br />1. Are you a raw material or semi-finished material provider to Government end-item contracts? If yes, please identify the raw material you produce and the corresponding end items they are used in. If you do not know if your material is used on DLA or DoD contracts, please identify the raw or semi-finished materials that have experience increasing lead times and higher than average prices, over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>2. Do you presently keep raw or semi-finished material inventories in support of Government contracts? If yes, what materials are these and do you see a basis to expand the inventory buffer for readiness purposes (i.e. to meet increased Warfighter demand)? If you believe there are limitations that would inhibit your ability to expand these buffers, please identify and explain those limitations.</p>
<p><br />3. If you are a supplier to DoD prime or sub-tier suppliers and currently do not maintain any raw or semi-finished inventories, would you consider developing and maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffer inventory of raw material? If yes, what materials would you consider doing this for? If no, please indicate why.</p>
<p>4. Would a program management and/or an inventory management fee be required for you to consider expanding, developing, or maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffers? If yes, please provide an estimate with an explanation of how it was derived?</p>
<p><br />5. Would you have the ability to track the established buffer inventory and provide monthly reports to the government?</p>
<p>6. Is there any additional information that you think is relevant for the Government to know about your ability and willingness to establish and maintain raw material buffers?<br />DISCLAMER: There is no guarantee that any submission in response to this RFI will result in a Government program. Responders to this RFI will have no competitive advantage in receiving any awards related to the submitted topic area. The information submitted in response to this RFI may be used to help the Government further define its requirements. If the Government develops a program that addresses any submitted or similar topic, the resulting procurement will address technology and business specific requirements as defined by the Government to achieve the required objectives.</p>
<p>PLEASE IDENTIFY THE INFORMATION, IN ANY OF YOUR ANSWERS, THAT YOU CONSIDERED TO BE PROPRIETARY.</p>
<p>4. Required Reponses<br />Responses to this RFI are limited to 5 single-sided, double-spaced pages, using standard letter-size 8&frac12;" x 11" paper. The font for text should be Times New Roman 12-point or larger. Responses must be unclassified. No binders or binding should be used. Reference RFI 12-0001. <br />5. Request for Clarification<br />A responder may request clarification, in writing, from the Contracting Officer for any requirement that is unclear, by sending an e-mail to melissa.spishak@dla.mil.</p>
<p>Any requests for clarification must be received no later than seven (7) business days prior to the close of this RFI in order to receive a timely response.</p>
<p>6. Submission of Documentation<br />Responses to this RFI are due to the contracting office identified below by 3:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time, 24 February 2012. Responders shall provide one (1) electronic copy and one (1) paper copy of their response. All electronic file content must match the print versions of the submitted documents. Should the electronic and print versions of submitted documents not match exactly, the electronic version shall take precedence. Electronic submissions, in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat formats, shall be accompanied by a printed inventory that identifies all CDs, their file contents, and their electronic formats. All CDs and files are to be labeled with the responder's name, contact information, and submission date. All RFI responses must be unclassified. Existing commercial documentation and product literature can also be submitted and is not subject to the page limitation.</p>
<p>Documentation shall be delivered to the Contracting Officer at the following address:<br />Defense Contracting Services Office <br />Attn: Melissa Spishak<br />700 Robbins Ave, Bldg 26-1N-8115<br />Philadelphia, PA 19111<br />Email: Melissa.Spishak@dla.mil</p>
<p>7. Additional Information<br />All responsible sources may submit information that shall be considered by the agency. If late information is received, it may be considered, depending on agency time constraints. All routine communications regarding this announcement should be directed to the contractual point of contact listed above. The Government may or may not use any responses to this RFI as a basis for a subsequent project. Any projects developed from the RFI responses may be the subject of a subsequent acquisition; any such subsequent acquisition will be posted in FBO.gov. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. The Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. No requests for a bid package or solicitation will be accepted; no bid package or solicitation exists at this time.

The intent would be to rotate the inventory through the fulfillment of orders to authorized value chain partners as identified by the government. The Warstopper Program seeks this initial information for the purpose of structuring future competitive solicitations related to raw material buffers to support go-to-war items.<br />Questions of consideration:<br />1. Are you a raw material or semi-finished material provider to Government end-item contracts? If yes, please identify the raw material you produce and the corresponding end items they are used in. If you do not know if your material is used on DLA or DoD contracts, please identify the raw or semi-finished materials that have experience increasing lead times and higher than average prices, over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>2. Do you presently keep raw or semi-finished material inventories in support of Government contracts? If yes, what materials are these and do you see a basis to expand the inventory buffer for readiness purposes (i.e. to meet increased Warfighter demand)? If you believe there are limitations that would inhibit your ability to expand these buffers, please identify and explain those limitations.</p>
<p><br />3. If you are a supplier to DoD prime or sub-tier suppliers and currently do not maintain any raw or semi-finished inventories, would you consider developing and maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffer inventory of raw material? If yes, what materials would you consider doing this for? If no, please indicate why.</p>
<p>4. Would a program management and/or an inventory management fee be required for you to consider expanding, developing, or maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffers? If yes, please provide an estimate with an explanation of how it was derived?</p>
<p><br />5. Would you have the ability to track the established buffer inventory and provide monthly reports to the government?</p>
<p>6. Is there any additional information that you think is relevant for the Government to know about your ability and willingness to establish and maintain raw material buffers?<br />DISCLAMER: There is no guarantee that any submission in response to this RFI will result in a Government program. Responders to this RFI will have no competitive advantage in receiving any awards related to the submitted topic area. The information submitted in response to this RFI may be used to help the Government further define its requirements.

General Intent<br />The purpose of the Warstopper Program is to ensure maintenance of "Those resources required for all plans, actions, or measures necessary to establish and maintain an industrial base, both government-owned and privately-owned, that is required to support current, wartime, or other contingency military requirements." The scope of the Warstopper Program includes all sectors of the industrial base necessary to support the Department of Defense (DoD) with manufacturing capabilities sufficient to meet increased requirements during wartime and contingency operations. <br />The Warstopper Program seeks to establish partnerships with raw material suppliers that support prime or sub-tier suppliers of DLA or DoD contracts to ensure that the industrial base is prepared to respond to the Military Services' increased demand for items designated as critical during times of mobilization, war, contingency and military or other operations. Rather than purchasing raw material, the Government is interested in contracting for the services of contractors to build and manage buffer inventories to be made available for the Government's needs. The intent would be to rotate the inventory through the fulfillment of orders to authorized value chain partners as identified by the government. The Warstopper Program seeks this initial information for the purpose of structuring future competitive solicitations related to raw material buffers to support go-to-war items.<br />Questions of consideration:<br />1. Are you a raw material or semi-finished material provider to Government end-item contracts? If yes, please identify the raw material you produce and the corresponding end items they are used in. If you do not know if your material is used on DLA or DoD contracts, please identify the raw or semi-finished materials that have experience increasing lead times and higher than average prices, over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>2. Do you presently keep raw or semi-finished material inventories in support of Government contracts? If yes, what materials are these and do you see a basis to expand the inventory buffer for readiness purposes (i.e. to meet increased Warfighter demand)? If you believe there are limitations that would inhibit your ability to expand these buffers, please identify and explain those limitations.</p>
<p><br />3. If you are a supplier to DoD prime or sub-tier suppliers and currently do not maintain any raw or semi-finished inventories, would you consider developing and maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffer inventory of raw material? If yes, what materials would you consider doing this for? If no, please indicate why.</p>
<p>4. Would a program management and/or an inventory management fee be required for you to consider expanding, developing, or maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffers? If yes, please provide an estimate with an explanation of how it was derived?</p>
<p><br />5. Would you have the ability to track the established buffer inventory and provide monthly reports to the government?</p>
<p>6. Is there any additional information that you think is relevant for the Government to know about your ability and willingness to establish and maintain raw material buffers?<br />DISCLAMER: There is no guarantee that any submission in response to this RFI will result in a Government program. Responders to this RFI will have no competitive advantage in receiving any awards related to the submitted topic area. The information submitted in response to this RFI may be used to help the Government further define its requirements.

<p>3. General Intent<br />The purpose of the Warstopper Program is to ensure maintenance of "Those resources required for all plans, actions, or measures necessary to establish and maintain an industrial base, both government-owned and privately-owned, that is required to support current, wartime, or other contingency military requirements." The scope of the Warstopper Program includes all sectors of the industrial base necessary to support the Department of Defense (DoD) with manufacturing capabilities sufficient to meet increased requirements during wartime and contingency operations. <br />The Warstopper Program seeks to establish partnerships with raw material suppliers that support prime or sub-tier suppliers of DLA or DoD contracts to ensure that the industrial base is prepared to respond to the Military Services' increased demand for items designated as critical during times of mobilization, war, contingency and military or other operations. Rather than purchasing raw material, the Government is interested in contracting for the services of contractors to build and manage buffer inventories to be made available for the Government's needs. The intent would be to rotate the inventory through the fulfillment of orders to authorized value chain partners as identified by the government. The Warstopper Program seeks this initial information for the purpose of structuring future competitive solicitations related to raw material buffers to support go-to-war items.<br />Questions of consideration:<br />1. Are you a raw material or semi-finished material provider to Government end-item contracts? If yes, please identify the raw material you produce and the corresponding end items they are used in. If you do not know if your material is used on DLA or DoD contracts, please identify the raw or semi-finished materials that have experience increasing lead times and higher than average prices, over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>2. Do you presently keep raw or semi-finished material inventories in support of Government contracts? If yes, what materials are these and do you see a basis to expand the inventory buffer for readiness purposes (i.e. to meet increased Warfighter demand)? If you believe there are limitations that would inhibit your ability to expand these buffers, please identify and explain those limitations.</p>
<p><br />3. If you are a supplier to DoD prime or sub-tier suppliers and currently do not maintain any raw or semi-finished inventories, would you consider developing and maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffer inventory of raw material? If yes, what materials would you consider doing this for? If no, please indicate why.</p>
<p>4. Would a program management and/or an inventory management fee be required for you to consider expanding, developing, or maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffers? If yes, please provide an estimate with an explanation of how it was derived?</p>
<p><br />5. Would you have the ability to track the established buffer inventory and provide monthly reports to the government?</p>
<p>6. Is there any additional information that you think is relevant for the Government to know about your ability and willingness to establish and maintain raw material buffers?<br />DISCLAMER: There is no guarantee that any submission in response to this RFI will result in a Government program. Responders to this RFI will have no competitive advantage in receiving any awards related to the submitted topic area. The information submitted in response to this RFI may be used to help the Government further define its requirements. If the Government develops a program that addresses any submitted or similar topic, the resulting procurement will address technology and business specific requirements as defined by the Government to achieve the required objectives.</p>

This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Further, DSCO-P is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that DLA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation. There is no bid package or solicitation at this time. All information received shall be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>3. General Intent<br />The purpose of the Warstopper Program is to ensure maintenance of "Those resources required for all plans, actions, or measures necessary to establish and maintain an industrial base, both government-owned and privately-owned, that is required to support current, wartime, or other contingency military requirements." The scope of the Warstopper Program includes all sectors of the industrial base necessary to support the Department of Defense (DoD) with manufacturing capabilities sufficient to meet increased requirements during wartime and contingency operations. <br />The Warstopper Program seeks to establish partnerships with raw material suppliers that support prime or sub-tier suppliers of DLA or DoD contracts to ensure that the industrial base is prepared to respond to the Military Services' increased demand for items designated as critical during times of mobilization, war, contingency and military or other operations. Rather than purchasing raw material, the Government is interested in contracting for the services of contractors to build and manage buffer inventories to be made available for the Government's needs. The intent would be to rotate the inventory through the fulfillment of orders to authorized value chain partners as identified by the government. The Warstopper Program seeks this initial information for the purpose of structuring future competitive solicitations related to raw material buffers to support go-to-war items.<br />Questions of consideration:<br />1. Are you a raw material or semi-finished material provider to Government end-item contracts? If yes, please identify the raw material you produce and the corresponding end items they are used in. If you do not know if your material is used on DLA or DoD contracts, please identify the raw or semi-finished materials that have experience increasing lead times and higher than average prices, over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>2. Do you presently keep raw or semi-finished material inventories in support of Government contracts? If yes, what materials are these and do you see a basis to expand the inventory buffer for readiness purposes (i.e. to meet increased Warfighter demand)? If you believe there are limitations that would inhibit your ability to expand these buffers, please identify and explain those limitations.</p>
<p><br />3. If you are a supplier to DoD prime or sub-tier suppliers and currently do not maintain any raw or semi-finished inventories, would you consider developing and maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffer inventory of raw material? If yes, what materials would you consider doing this for? If no, please indicate why.</p>
<p>4. Would a program management and/or an inventory management fee be required for you to consider expanding, developing, or maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffers? If yes, please provide an estimate with an explanation of how it was derived?</p>
<p><br />5. Would you have the ability to track the established buffer inventory and provide monthly reports to the government?</p>
<p>6. Is there any additional information that you think is relevant for the Government to know about your ability and willingness to establish and maintain raw material buffers?<br />DISCLAMER: There is no guarantee that any submission in response to this RFI will result in a Government program. Responders to this RFI will have no competitive advantage in receiving any awards related to the submitted topic area. The information submitted in response to this RFI may be used to help the Government further define its requirements. If the Government develops a program that addresses any submitted or similar topic, the resulting procurement will address technology and business specific requirements as defined by the Government to achieve the required objectives.</p>
<p>PLEASE IDENTIFY THE INFORMATION, IN ANY OF YOUR ANSWERS, THAT YOU CONSIDERED TO BE PROPRIETARY.</p>
<p>4. Required Reponses<br />Responses to this RFI are limited to 5 single-sided, double-spaced pages, using standard letter-size 8&frac12;" x 11" paper. The font for text should be Times New Roman 12-point or larger. Responses must be unclassified. No binders or binding should be used. Reference RFI 12-0001. <br />5. Request for Clarification<br />A responder may request clarification, in writing, from the Contracting Officer for any requirement that is unclear, by sending an e-mail to melissa.spishak@dla.mil.</p>
<p>Any requests for clarification must be received no later than seven (7) business days prior to the close of this RFI in order to receive a timely response.</p>
<p>6. Submission of Documentation<br />Responses to this RFI are due to the contracting office identified below by 3:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time, 24 February 2012. Responders shall provide one (1) electronic copy and one (1) paper copy of their response. All electronic file content must match the print versions of the submitted documents.

<a href="mailto:donna.williams@hq.doe.gov">Williams, Donna C</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) intends to award a sole source contract to the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) for an independent review of the Department?s management and oversight of DOE?s national laboratories.  NAPA will consider such issues:
?	Achieving Optimal Performance.  How the national laboratories carry out their tasks and what flexibility is required to obtain optimal performance?
?	Site Office Oversight.  How DOE site offices oversee the laboratories, including identifying existing tools/systems used by the site offices to manage their laboratory-related responsibilities?
?	HQ/Program Oversight.  How DOE headquarters program offices oversee both their laboratories and their site offices managing laboratories?
?	Metrics. Whether DOE?s laboratory metrics adequately assess critical aspects of their performance and how DOE uses these metrics to ensure accountability:
DOE Systems Support.  Whether the Department?s management systems provide adequate support to the laboratories?   NAPA should consider the findings of a recent report by the National Laboratory Directors Council, which expressed concerns about overly burdensome oversight and operational requirements. 
The NAPA is uniquely qualified to provide the expert, independent organizational review required as it is the preeminent independent, non-profit organization for public governance.  Established in 1967 and chartered by Congress, the NAPA has become an independent source of trusted advice for every branch and level of government, congressional committees and civic organizations.  The NAPA works constructively with government agencies to improve their performance and management through problem solving, objective research, comprehensive analysis, strategic plans, and connecting people and ideas.  It exists solely to help Government achieve excellence.
The unique source of the NAPA?s expertise is its membership, which includes more than 600 current and former Cabinet officers, members of Congress, governors, mayors, legislators, jurists, business executives, public managers, and scholars who are elected as Fellows because of their distinguished contribution to the field of public administration through scholarship, civic activism, or government service.  Participation in the Academy?s work is a requisite of membership, and the Fellows offer their experience and knowledge on a voluntary basis.
The NAPA maintains a core professional staff that is regularly augmented by study teams recruited for their superior qualifications to contribute to specific projects.  Panels composed of Fellows and invited experts from science, business, labor, and other relevant fields, direct project and study activities. 
Since its establishment in 1967, the NAPA has responded to a multitude of requests for assistance from various agencies and has undertaken numerous studies on issues of particular interest to Congress.  .  In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, other than full and open competition is authorized when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  
This is a notice of intent and no solicitation is available for this requirement.The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services.  The period of performance is nine months.  
Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements described above.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements received within 15 days after the publication date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received may also be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Joint CREW I1B1 acquisition program (formerly JCREW 3.3) provides the military services with an electronic warfare capability to counter the threat from Radio-Controlled IEDs (RCIED). The Joint CREW Program is managed by PMS-408 EOD/CREW and it intends to host a CLASSIFIED Open Business (OB) Industry Information Exchange Day to increase Governments access to creative innovation while educating prospective vendors on strategies to provide new capabilities and services to our warfighters. This event is open to system integrators, innovators, and third party suppliers who meet the requirements to attend.

This CLASSIFIED Industry Information Exchange Day will discuss future acquisition strategies leveraging the benefits of open architecture design elements to create the means for third-party technology innovators to participate in a coherent development, procurement and validation of system and sub-system level technology insertion /technology refresh (TI/TR).
  Currently, PMS-408 EOD/CREW plans for a series of incremental developments to enable technology insertion and technology refresh as follows:  1) Technology insertion updates cut into the existing production line to include hardware, firmware or software, into existing production line every three years, 2) Periodic technology refresh of fielded systems every six years (retrofitting - fielded systems) to maintain common baselines and to account for obsolescence while countering the rapidly evolving threat.  

The JCREW System of System (SoS) approach includes three distinct systems that utilize common hardware, software and firmware components.  These systems are: dismounted system (man-portable), mounted system (ground vehicle and waterborne), and fixed site system (temporary geographical area and permanent).
  The overall system architectures open, modular and flexible design ensures the ability to upgrade the product baseline for performance, affordability, availability and reliability.  

The Classified Industry Information Exchange Day will be on 4 April 2012 and held at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab, Kossiakoff Center, 11100 Johns Hopkins Road, Laurel, Maryland 20723.  Directions to Kossiakoff Center may be provided upon registration.  Breakfast and lunch will be provided at a cost of $25.00 per person to be paid in advance via check or money order. Space constraints make it necessary to limit attendance to two people per company. To register, please contact Sherri Patsos, at 202.781.0078, email:  JCREWIIEDay@navy.mil by 19 March 2012.
 The email shall include the participants full name, company they are representing, along with their titles and email addresses. ALL VISITORS are required to submit advance notice via faxed to 240-228-6400 to the attention of Incoming Visitor Control.  Voice Confirmation may be obtained at 240-228-5661.  The advance notice should include the following information:

1.	Facility's name, address, telephone number, Commercial and Government Entity (Cage) code, if applicable, and certification of the level of the facility security clearance; 
2.	Name, date and place of birth, citizenship, and SSN of the employee intending to visit;
3.	Certification of the proposed visitor's PCL and any special access authorizations required for the visit;
4.	Name of person(s) to be visited;
5.	Purpose of the visit;
6.	Date or period during which the visit request is to be valid;
and
7.	Security Office signature

If your organization uses the DoD database, JPAS, they may send it to us using our SMO Code:  888984.
     
On the day of the event, visitors will need to check in at the Kossiakoff Center and registration/security information will be verified prior to entrance.
 The tentative agenda is below.  All the briefings will remain at the unclassified level presenting the acquisition strategy, the high-level system requirements, and future technology requirements.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, SAO-EAST, NCO 4, Philadelphia VAMC, Vet Center # 210 intends to award a sole-source, firm fixed contract in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.302-1. This requirement is for the provision of Readjustment Counseling Services. The Government intends to make a sole source award to Family & Psychological Services, Inc, 1868 Greentree Road, Cherry Hill, NJ 08003, under NAICS Code 621420. The solicitation will not be posted.  For any questions please contact Contract Specialist, Matt Parlett at 610.384.7711 EXT 3233 or via e-mail at Matthew.Parlett@va.gov.


OVERVIEW.

The contractor shall furnish readjustment counseling services to eligible veterans referred by Vet Center staff members or professional staff members of VA Psychiatry, Social Work, Psychology or Nursing Services.  Readjustment counseling, for purposes of the considered contract, is counseling provided by social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, or other qualified counselors, individually or in groups, specifically directed at social, psychological, or behavioral difficulties specifically related to the post-war readjustment to civilian life.  Such difficulties may interfere with a veteran's job performance, educational pursuits, family and other interpersonal relations, or overall ability to cope with daily life.  Modalities of readjustment counseling include individual, group, and family counseling; all of which have as their central purpose the post-war readjustment of Vietnam era and/or post-Vietnam war zone veterans.

The contemplated contract represents the drawing down and the discontinuing of contracting for readjustment counseling services by the Vet Center # 210.  No further solicitation or requirements for readjustment counseling are planned or anticipated.

Contracting by sole source allows for the avoidance of; transferring client records from the incumbent contractor to a new contractor and then to a VA provider, and to provide for the smoothest transition possible for clients so that their counseling experience is not unduly interrupted/compromised by having to switch counselors multiple times during the duration of a few months.

<DESC><p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The Government is seeking a contractor that can provide and deliver the 2012-2013 Season Influenza Virus Vaccine to over 295 FOH Occupational Health Centers in numerous city locations within the 48 continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii. The Government is requesting information regarding the availability, delivery, and pricing. FOH anticipates administering approximately 200,290 doses, provided in 50% multi-dose vials and 50% single dose pre-filled syringes unless specifically authorized by COTR. The Government is requesting Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) pricing or Big 4 pricing. Please refer to Attachment A for shipping locations.</p>
<p>TITLE<br />Injectable Influenza Virus Vaccine</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Federal Occupational Health Service (FOH), provides occupational health services to other Federal agencies. FOH provides occupational health (OH) consultation, and stimulates the development of improved OH and safety programs throughout the Federal Government. FOH defines OH from the Federal Government perspective as "a comprehensive approach, with a public health perspective, to improving the health and safety of the Federal work force; thereby increasing their productivity, and decreasing the Government's liability and health care costs through various clinical, environmental, educational, and risk-based prevention programs." The FOH mission is to be the benchmark for Federal OH programs.</p>
<p>FOH is the single largest provider of OH services in the Federal government, serving more than 360 Federal government agencies and departments and reaching more than 1.5 million Federal government employees. FOH provides these services to other Federal agencies under 42 USC 231. These services are 100% reimbursed by the agencies to FOH. Agreements are negotiated with Federal government departments' and agencies' national headquarters, and/or with their regional/local components. Some agreements contain a standard package of OH program components. One of these services is the provision of influenza vaccination to prevent seasonal flu. The program helps assure the implementation of effective immunization practices and proper use of vaccines to achieve higher immunization coverage.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF SERVICES</p>
<p>The contractor would be expected to provide and deliver the 2012-2013 Season Influenza Virus Vaccines to over 295 FOH Occupational Health Centers in numerous city locations within the 48 continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii.

Technical and past performances, when combined, are significantly more important than price. All offeror's shall provide with their quotation, descriptive literature, brochures, and technical proposal response.

The total evaluated price will be calculated as follows:<br />(1) The evaluated price will be the unit price proposed multiplied by the specified unit quantity (e.g. 1 EACH),<br />(2) For the option units where there is a quantity range, the evaluated price will be the unit price proposed multiplied by the maximum quantity in that range.<br />(3) The sum of all CLINs (Basic Year and Options) will represent the total evaluated price.<br />(4) Offeror's are advised that the evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise such options;<br />FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, with Alternate I.

(i) The offeror certifies that each end product, except those listed in paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this provision, is a U.S.-made or designated country end product, as defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled ?Trade Agreements.? (ii) The offeror shall list as other end products those end products that are not U.S.-made or designated country end products. List other End Products:<BR><BR>(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<BR><BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products.<BR><BR>(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] [  ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. [  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture.

For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly?

(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies? (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.<BR><BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror?s relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<RESPDATE>021312
<CONTACT>Jonathan M. Lear, Contract Specialist, Email learj@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to BioComp Instruments, Inc., 650 Churchill Row, Fredericton, NB, CAN E3B 1P6 for the following equipment:</p>
<p>-	BioComp Gradient Station</p>
<p>The Laboratory of Ribonucleoprotein Biochemistry in NHLBI conducts research on the function of messenger RNA-protein complexes in health and disease.  The gradient station is necessary for the formation and fractionation of density gradients.  Density gradient centrifugation is an important technique for the biochemical analysis of mRNAs.  These experiments require reproducible formation of gradients of sucrose, glycerol, or other solutions, followed by ultracentrifugation and collection and analysis of fractions.  In particular, the experiments require gradient fractionation followed by mass spectrometry to identify proteins present in individual fractions.  Because mass spectrometry is a highly sensitive technique, it is essential that samples generated both within a single experiment and across several experiments be as similar as possible.  The gradient station is a unique instrument that combines and automates making reproducible gradients and collecting very small, high resolution fractions which are essential for NHLBI studies.</p>
<p>The following specifications are necessary with this particular equipment:</p>
<p>-	Combined instrument for making reproducible gradients and fractionating them after ultracentrifugation;<br />-	Automated, programmable gradient making capability;<br />-	Compatibility with a large number of solutes;<br />-	Simultaneous formation of six (6) gradients for optimal reproducibility;<br />-	Automated high resolution gradient collection (fractionating) capability;<br />-	Built-in monitoring of fraction volume and position;<br />-	In-line UV monitoring and fraction collection with digital data collection; and,<br />-	Small footprint to maximize limited bench space.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that this gradient station is the only commercial system available to generate and analyze density gradients in a single package.  The gradient forming function is capable of producing six (6) identical gradients in as little as forty (40) seconds, with reproducibility that is not possible in manual gradient formation.  This reproducibility is essential for the accurate comparison of multiple samples for analysis using biochemical methods and mass spectrometry.  The fractionator module uses a patented system to draw gradient functions as small as ten (10) microns thick, resolutions that are impossible using manual protocols.  The fractionator monitors the position of the meniscus, a unique feature important for sample-to-sample reproducibility.  In-line UV monitoring and fraction collection speeds data collection and allows detailed analysis of polyribosome profiles, in a digital format.  Together, these attributes are essential for the research program of the laboratory, as the work requires precise fractionation of sub-populations of RNA-protein complexes in a highly reproducible manner.  The gradient station is the only available instrument that is capable of fulfilling this need.</p>

<DESC><p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Promega Corporation, 2800 Woods Hollow Road, Madison, Wisconsin, 53711 for the procurement of Qty, 20- BacTiter<sup>TM</sup> Glo Microbial Cell Assay, 10x100ml.<br /><br />The mission of the NCGC is to apply the tools of small molecule screening and discovery to the development of chemical probe research tools, for use in the study of protein and cell functions, and biological processes relevant to physiology and disease. NCGC will optimize biochemical, cellular and model organism-based assays submitted by the biomedical research community; perform automated high-throughput screening (HTS); and perform chemistry optimization on confirmed hits to produce chemical probes for dissemination to the research community.<br /><br />The sole source determination is based upon the fact that Promega Corporation does not distribute this item to any other resellers; as such, Promega Corporation is the sole provider of this particular reagent. The BacTiterGlo assay from Promega consists of a proprietary reagent. This reagent has been specifically optimized for these projects. This item is critical to the assay needed to determine cell viability. NCGC cannot use a different reagent without complete re-optimization. This request is a sole source procurement required in order to avoid the introduction of new variables into this ongoing project.</p>
<p>NCGC must use the same variables in the assays to maintain integrity from the data and to achieve the desired outcomes. A switch to a different detection reagent would necessitate re-optimizing the assay with no guarantees that the results would be similar. This would entail unacceptable substantial time delays and enormous additional costs.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 325413, with business size standard 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC)05-54 (November 2, 2011). This acquisition is set-aside for small business.<br /><br />Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by the closing date, January 20,, 2012 will be considered by the Government. A determination to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br /><br />Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number, NHGRI-CSB-(HG)-2012-051-RSF may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Rashida Ferebee.

The software meets the following needs for the NCATS (1) Access to drugs and investigational drugs worldwide; (2) Data on the mechanisms by which those drugs work; (3) Disease information and associated drugs, targets and clinical trials; (4) Access to associated patents for above content. These needs are essential to the operation of the NCATS. There are no other known products that contain the comprehensive and manually curated data that exists in the Integrity database. This purchase is a renewal of a previous purchase order. The software is currently being used by NCGC and to change vendors at this time would be detrimental to the work that has been completed. <br />PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />1 year, 4-user subscription to Thomson Reuters Integrity Subscription Access<br />Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 519130, with business size standard 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-54 (November 2, 2011). This acquisition is set-aside for small business.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

Bullets not followed by an "A:" - refer to attached drawings.<br><br>Group 8 Questions:<br><br><br>COMMENT:  After looking at the Q & A and drawings - the shelving width sizes that were drawn are not typically standard sizes and only 2'0" per section across for the majority of the systems. Also the system on the South Wall for Helicopter Parts would only leave less than a 2' access aisle while on the North Side there would be a 10' aisle.<br><br>CLARIFICATION: With the regards to the isle space on the South end, we opened a space between the shelves for clarity on the floor plan. Based on the dimensions s (412"or 34'-4") that leaves a total of 3'-4" for the isle. On the North end, the isle is 11'-4". Units A/C on the South end are 4'-0", we have shown them as 4'-2" per unit so it would be easier to understand the floor plan. If the user needs to lose a row, preference is to drop Row C from the Lakota LUH-72.  But at the same time user would like Row A Lakota to become a hybrid. User would like that row to become a combination of A and C cabinets. A Cabinet type should be the majority. (Roughly 2/3)<br><br>Q-1: Would alternate shelf sizes and layouts providing more useable capacity be acceptable solutions to the overall mission statement? <br><br>A: Yes.<br><br>Q-2: Will the due date for responses be extended a few days? <br><br>A:  Yes, Change from 11:00AM 14 February 2012 to 4:00PM 16 February 2012.<br><br><br>

     (i) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF THE ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT    (ii) ABILITY TO MEET REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE(S) AND FOB TERMS   (iii) PRICE

<DESC>Question:<br>I was wondering why the 1st & 2nd site visits were so far apart (4 hours).  I don't know about others, but it certainly would be more convenient if the 2nd site visit followed the 1st, or at least shortly thereafter; say, 30 minutes or so, separation. <br>I don't know if you have a choice concerning the time frame(s), but if you do maybe you could consider putting the two (2) site visits closer together.  <br><br>Answer:<br>There are no plans to adjust the site plan schedule.  If they're unable to attend at the scheduled time, they may look from outside the fence.  You can see 95% of the project site from there.  The USACE personnel may not assist in any way accept during the site plan schedule.  <br><br>

VENDOR QUESTIONS AND GOVERNMENT RESPONSES

THE GOVERNMENT HAS RECIEVED AND RESPONDED TO BEST PRACTICES AND INDUSTRY FEEDBACK TO INCLUDE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS REGARDING THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. THE m-FoCS REQUIREMENT WILL BE SOLICITED ON A FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION BASIS IN A FUTURE ANNOUNCEMENT UNDER THE SOLICITATION NUMBER W15P7T-12-R-0001<br><br>At the bottom of page under Additional Info please click on Additional Documentation link to review attachment titled "SpecialNotice_QandAs_18NOV2011" for Questions and Responses from this Special Notice posted 21 October 2011.<br><br>Requirement Info:<br><br>The Army's modernization effort of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) has introduced a multitude of new and improved Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) equipments that will enhance the soldier's ability to plan, monitor, communicate and execute the mission. Each C4ISR system designed their own unique hardware to meet its stated operational requirement / mission. Installation of these C4ISR systems into command and control vehicles has become difficult due to space restrictions. Multiple Processors, Displays, Input/output and communications devices and installations kits within a command vehicle have reached the saturation point. The Size, Weight, Power and overall Cost (SWAP-C) involved with duplication of computing hardware for all these C4ISR systems is a major concern. The m-FoCS hardware (referred to as Mission Command Common Computing Platform (MC3P) in prior presolicitation announcements) is a means to alleviate these concerns.<br><br>

<DESC>The purpose of this Modification of previous notice to the draft RFP is to revise the draft OCI verbiage to reflect the following (Please submit any questions or comments regarding this revision by Close of Business Monday, February 20th, 2012):<br><br>H-25  ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (OCI)<br><br>Introduction: The LSFMA contract will be a Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract and there will be continuing competition during the ordering period of the contract. The Government recognizes its responsibility to maintain the integrity of the competitive process by protecting the competitive sensitive data of the multiple awardees.  However, the Government also recognizes that contractors providing support on multiple services contracts have the potential to severely affect mission accomplishment through conflicts of interest.  The buying activity, ACC-Redstone, must be able to maintain competition on task orders under this and other contracts.    <br><br>The LSFMA contract will receive a preponderance of requirements from aviation program offices located at Redstone Arsenal Alabama.  These program offices, and the RDEC Directorates that provide aviation support (such as Aviation Engineering Directorate, Software Engineering Directorate, and Engineering Directorate) heavily utilize Contract Advisory and Assistance Services (CAAS) contracts and in particular the "AMCOM EXPRESS" contract.  As a result, LSFMA contractors that participate in other CAAS contracts to specifically include the "AMCOM EXPRESS" contract are considered to have a high potential of OCI issues that will require robust mitigation plans.  This is especially true as it relates to FAR 9.505-4, "Obtaining Access to Proprietary Information."  An overarching mitigation plan is required to be submitted with the contractors competitive proposal for Government review and ultimately into the contract.  In addition, each delivery order will be reviewed to determine if the overarching OCI plan meets the need for OCI protection or if a need to tailor the plan for any specific order will be required.  <br>If you are a prime contractor on the AMCOM EXPRESS contract, you are considered to have an OCI with the LSFMA program that will require a mitigation plan that, at a minimum, divests you from working on the AMCOM EXPRESS contract for any current or future work supporting a particular program office once the program office commences effort generating an LSFMA requirement.  If you are a subcontractor to a prime on the AMCOM EXPRESS contract, you are considered to have an OCI that has the potential for issues during the life of the LSFMA contract and a robust OCI mitigation plan is required. All Offerors are advised to review the OCI clause contained in their CAAS contracts and should provide a copy of their clause with their proposed mitigation plan.        <br><br> a.  Definitions.<br><br>	"Organizational Conflict of Interest" means that because of other contractual activities or relationships with the Government or other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage.  "Person" as used herein includes Corporations, Partnerships, Joint Ventures, Teaming Arrangements, and other business enterprises. <br><br>	"Contractor", as used in this clause, means any person, firm or corporation which has a majority or controlling interest in the contractor or in any parent corporation thereof, any person, firm, or corporation in or as to which the contractor (or any parent or subsidiary corporation thereof) has a majority or controlling interest.  The term also includes the corporate officers of the contractor, those of any corporation which has a majority or controlling interest in the contractor, and those of any corporation in which the contractor (or any parent or subsidiary corporation thereof) has a majority or controlling interest. All references to the "Contractor" as contained in this clause shall apply with equal force to all of these included.<br><br>	"Contract", as used in this clause, means the basic contract or any task order issued there under as applicable to the level at which this clause is being invoked.<br><br>b.  OCI Potential.<br><br>	It is recognized by the parties hereto that the effort to be performed by the contractor under the LSFMA contract includes the repair and modification of components and end items, fabrication of hardware, logistic and technical support, trade studies and the update and maintenance of data and drawings, systems engineering as related to the requirement to perform a logistics task and  a myriad of systems production efforts.  Each requirement has a potential for access to other contractors' proprietary information.  Consequently, performance of this contract creates potential OCIs such as are contemplated by FAR 9.505 or other applicable Federal Law current at the time of contract award or subsequently enacted thereafter.  It is the intention of the parties that the contractor will not engage in any contractual or other activities which could create an OCI with its position under this contract; which might impair its ability to render objective/unbiased advice and recommendations on this contract or other contracts; or by which it may derive an unfair competitive advantage as a result of knowledge, information, and experience gained during the performance of this contract or other contracts and applied to this contract.  <br><br>c.  Contractor Responsibilities.<br><br>	(1)  The contractor warrants that to the best of its knowledge and belief, and except as otherwise set forth in the contract, the contractor does not have any organizational conflict of interest(s) as defined in paragraph a. above.  The contractor agrees that, if after award, it discovers an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest at the contract level (basic contract or task order) it shall make immediate and full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer.  Changes in the contractor's relationships due to mergers, consolidations or other unanticipated circumstances may create an unacceptable organizational conflict of interest which might necessitate such disclosure.  The notification shall include a description of the actual or potential organizational conflict of interest, a description of the action that the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the conflict, and any other relevant information that would assist the Contracting Officer in making a determination on this matter.<br><br>	(2)  The contractor agrees to maintain and implement a Conflicts of Interest (COI) Compliance Plan for the duration of this contract.  The COI Compliance Plan shall identify the contractor's approach for adhering to the terms of this clause and shall describe its procedures for aggressively self-identifying and resolving both organizational and employee conflicts of interest.  The overall purpose of the COI Compliance Plan is to demonstrate how the contractor will assure that its operations meet the highest standards of ethical conduct, and how its assistance and advice are impartial and objective.  The COI Compliance Plan shall specifically address how the contractor will (a) Protect confidential, proprietary, or sensitive information; (b) Prevent the existence of conflicting roles that might bias the contractor's judgment; and (c) Prevent an unfair competitive advantage.  The contractor shall permit the Government to review the COI Compliance Plan at any time during the life of this contract.<br><br>	(3)  The contractor understands that, as a minimum, the following is considered an immediate OCI issue:  access to competitive sensitive data such as other contractor cost or pricing information to include rates and development of hours, technical approaches, technical data and processes generated by a contractor and not readily available to the public, design and development information not readily available to the public.  This is a representative list and is not all inclusive. <br><br>	(4)  The contractor shall review and become familiar with the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 9.5 "Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest (OCI)."  Particular attention is directed to FAR 9.505, FAR 9.505-1, FAR 9.505-2, FAR 9.505-3 and FAR 9.505-4.<br><br>d.  Task Order Level OCI.<br><br>	(1)  Specific efforts to be performed under this contract shall be defined by individual task orders issued hereunder.  It is anticipated that the activities discussed below, which will likely arise under certain task orders, could lead to or result in the creation of an OCI.  These activities are not exhaustive of all potential OCIs, but are common to contracts that produce data, a product, information, assistance services or are conducted in an area that provides access to other contracts and/or other contractor information.<br><br>	Advanced Access to Acquisition Information - Task order performance under this contract may provide the contractor access to source selection or other acquisition information in advance of such information being provided to the public.  Such information could provide the contractor a competitive advantage in a future acquisition and could be perceived as unfair by a competing contractor who is not given similar access to the relevant information.  Unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, the contractor is precluded from participating in contracting actions in which it was provided advanced access to acquisition information.  <br><br>	Development of Acquisition Data - Task order performance under this contract may require the contractor to participate in the development of Government data that will be utilized for a separate Government acquisition.  Such performance may include the drafting of statements of work, specifications, cost estimates, or evaluation criteria of future procurements.  This activity places the contractor in a situation that could allow it to manipulate key aspects of a future procurement in its own favor, creating an unfair advantage over competing vendors and/or in a position of improperly influencing its own potential work.  Unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, the contractor is precluded from participating in future acquisitions, either competitive or non-competitive, for which it has participated in the development of any acquisition data.<br><br>	Assessment of Contractor Products and Services - Task order performance under this contract may require the contractor to assess and evaluate systems, subsystems, components, software, equipment, services, and other products developed/provided by Government contractors.  It is imperative that the contractor render objective and unbiased advice to the Government in performing such tasks and that its impartiality not be  undermined by the contractor's financial or other business relationship to the entity whose work is being assessed or evaluated.  As such, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, the contractor shall not assess or evaluate any system, subsystem, component, software, equipment, services, or other product developed/provided by itself, or another business division, or subsidiary of the same corporation, or other entity with which it has a significant financial relationship. <br><br>	(2)  The contractor agrees that it will assess all LSFMA task order requirements and other Government contract opportunities for which it desires to participate either as a prime contractor, subcontractor at any tier, or consultant for perceived, potential, or actual conflicts of interests as described above.  The contractor further agrees to promptly notify and seek the prior written approval of both the LSFMA Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer on the other acquisition before participating in any contract action, as a prime contractor, subcontractor at any tier, or consultant to provide material, equipment or services for which a perceived, potential, or actual conflict exists.  Requests for approval of the LSFMA Contracting Officer shall comply with the requirements set forth below.  The contractor shall follow the OCI approval procedures of the other acquisition, if applicable, and provide a copy of that approval/disapproval to the LSFMA Contracting Officer.<br><br>		(a)  The contractor shall submit OCI approval requests on a task order-by-task order basis, unless the contractor is aware of multiple task orders that may create the appearance of a conflict, or be an actual conflict.  In either case, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as the conflict/apparent conflict has been identified, but not later than the date set for receipt of task order proposals.  Identification of the OCI and a copy of the request shall be included in the task order proposal.<br><br>		(b)  The contractor's request for approval to the Contracting Officer shall include a detailed mitigation plan describing how the conflict will be mitigated or otherwise avoided.  The mitigation plan shall describe in detail the task order requirement that creates the potential conflict of interest, and outline in detail the actions to be taken by the contractor to mitigate or avoid the conflict.<br><br>		(c)  The Contracting Officer will consider the request for written approval and, at its discretion, may negotiate the terms of the mitigation plan to the satisfaction of the Government or, if the conflict cannot be adequately mitigated or avoided, determine the contractor ineligible to participate in the contract action.  The Government reserves the right to reject any mitigation plan, if in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, such a plan is not in the best interests of the Government.<br><br>		(d)  Notwithstanding the existence of a conflict of interest, and if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to seek waiver of OCI restrictions accordance with FAR 9.503.<br><br>		(e)  The Contracting Officer's decision as to the existence or nonexistence of an actual or potential OCI shall be final.  The contractor shall not commence work on any task order involving an actual or potential OCI until specifically notified by the Contracting Officer to proceed.  <br><br>	(3)  The contractor shall permit the Government to review and assess the contractor's adherence to all approved OCI mitigation plans at any time during the life of this contract and for a period of one (1) year thereafter.  Reviews of mitigation plans will be conducted at the discretion of the Contracting Officer and may consider changes in the vendor community due to mergers, consolidations, or any other unanticipated circumstances that could create an unacceptable OCI.  The contractor agrees to fully cooperate with such reviews and shall provide all information relevant to the implementation of approved plans.<br><br>e.  Protection of Information.<br><br>	(1)  Whenever performance of this contract requires access to another contractor's proprietary information (and in particular cost and hour development information), the contractor shall (i) enter into a written agreement with the other entity involved, as appropriate, in order to protect such proprietary information from unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it remains proprietary; and (ii) refrain from using such proprietary information other than as agreed to under this contract (e.g., to provide assistance to the Government during technical evaluation of other contractors' offers or products).  An executed copy of all proprietary information agreements by individual personnel or on a corporate basis shall be furnished to the Contracting Officer within fifteen (15) calendar days of execution unless waived by the Contracting Officer.<br><br>	(2)  The contractor shall instruct and advise its employees, through appropriate means (such as formal training and promulgation of company policies and procedures), the principles of FAR Subpart 9.5 or other applicable Federal law current at the time of contract award or subsequently enacted thereafter.  Such inculcation shall include, but not be limited to, training to ensure that employees refrain from using or disclosing proprietary information except as provided by executed agreement or as allowed by the contract.  Further, the contractor shall obtain from each of its employees, whose anticipated responsibility in connection with the work under this contract may be reasonably expected to involve access to such proprietary information, a written agreement, which in substance shall provide that such employee will not, during his/her employment by the contractor or anytime thereafter, improperly disclose such data or information.<br><br>	(3)  The contractor agrees that it shall not release, disclose, or use in any way that would permit or result in disclosure to any party outside the Government, any information provided to the contractor by the Government during or as a result of performance of this contract or any task order issued there under.  Such information includes, but is not limited to, information submitted to the Government on a confidential basis by other persons. Further, the prohibition against release of Government provided information extends to cover such information whether or not in its original form, where the information has been included in contractor generated work, or where it is discernible from materials incorporating or based upon such information.  This prohibition shall not expire after any given period of time.<br><br>	(4)  The contractor shall hold the Government harmless and will freely indemnify the Government as to any cost/loss resulting from the unauthorized use or disclosure of any third-party proprietary information by its employees, the employees of subcontractors, or by its agents.<br><br>f.  Compliance.<br><br>	Compliance with the requirements of this OCI clause is a material obligation of this contract and any issued task orders.  The rights and remedies described herein shall not be exclusive and are in addition to other rights and remedies provided by law, including those set forth at FAR Part 9.5, or elsewhere included in this contract.  If the contractor takes any action prohibited by this clause or fails to take action required by this clause, then the Government may terminate this contract for default.  For breach of any of the restrictions contained herein, or for nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant facts required to be disclosed concerning this contract, the Government reserves the right to terminate this contract for default, disqualify the contractor for subsequent related contractual efforts, and to pursue such other remedies as may be available under law.  If, in compliance with this clause, the contractor discovers and promptly reports an organizational conflict of interest subsequent to contract award, the Contracting Officer may choose to undertake termination of this contract for convenience of the Government, when such termination is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.<br><br>g.  Effective Period.  <br><br>	This clause shall have effect throughout the period of performance of this contract (and any applicable task order performance period that exceeds the basic contract ordering period), any extensions thereto by change order or supplemental agreement, and for one (1) year thereafter.  <br><br>h.  The contractor shall include the same terms as are expressed in this clause, including this paragraph, in all subcontracts awarded for performance of any portion of this requirement.  When the provisions of this clause are included in a subcontract, any subcontractor requests for Contracting Officer approval required by the clause shall be submitted through the prime contractor.  Subcontract restrictions will be limited to the technical area(s) addressed in the specific statements of work in the subcontractor's given task orders.<br><br><br>

<p><strong>The US Department of Education hereby announces the release of the 2012 Small Business Innovation Research Program Fast-Track for Special Education solicitation.<br /><br /></strong>SBIR Fast-Track option - A Fast-Track proposal is a single proposal that contains both Phase I and Phase II activities. Through the Fast-Track (Phase I &amp; II) option, the US Department of Education intends to fund proposals that have high potential for the commercialization of technologically innovative products that contribute to improved student learning or teacher practices from pre-kindergarten through adult education. By providing the opportunity to concurrently submit and review a proposal that contains both Phase I and Phase II activities, the Fast-Track option has the potential to minimize any funding gap between the Phase I and Phase II periods.</p>
<p>In order to apply for Fast-Track funding, offerors must download, read and comply with the SBIR&nbsp;Fast Track proposal instructions. A Fast-Track Technical Evaluation Review Panel will evaluate all eligible Fast-Track proposals. The Fast-Track proposal will receive a single rating for the proposed Phase I and Phase II project.</p>
<p>Phase I. - Phase I is to determine, insofar as possible, the scientific or technical merit of ideas submitted under the SBIR program. The proposal should concentrate on R/R&amp;D that will significantly contribute to proving the feasibility of the technological approach, a prerequisite for further ED support in Phase II. Institute awards are for periods up to six (6) months in amounts up to $150,000.</p>
<p>Phase II - Phase II is to expand on the results of and to further pursue the development of Phase I projects. Phase II is the principal R/R&amp;D effort. It requires a more comprehensive plan, outlining the effort in detail including the commercial potential. Awards are for periods up to two (2)-years in amounts up to $900,000.</p>
<p>SBIR Fast-Track awards are for&nbsp;total periods up to 30 months in the amounts up to $1,050,000<br /><br /><strong>PLEASE NOTE- This solicitation is for proposals in the area&nbsp;of Special Education.&nbsp; Any proposals received that are not in the area of Special Education will not be considered.<br /></strong></p>

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) plans to establish one (1) Coordinating Center as part of the Hispanic Community Health Study-Study of Latinos study renewal. The HCHS-SOL involves a clinical examination (Visit 2) of the cohort that includes repeat and new measures to be performed in Junel 01, 2013 thru May 31, 2019; as well as continued follow-up contact and clinical events surveillance of the cohort. The Field Center&rsquo;s effort is expected to begin on June 01, 2013 and to end on May 31, 2019. The HCHS-SOL began in 2006 in four U.S. communities (San Diego, CA; Chicago, IL; Bronx, NY; and Miami, FL). Approximately 16,000 Hispanic/Latino men and women between 18 and 74 years of age were recruited between 2008 and 2011 across communities. A baseline examination (Visit 1) was performed during that period of time. The objectives of the renewal of the HCHS-SOL program are to 1) further investigate the apparent paradox of high socioeconomic adversity, substantial cardiovascular and pulmonary disease (CVPD) risk factor burden, and low CVPD prevalence and mortality in Hispanics; 2) identify putative causes for diseases and conditions highly prevalent in Hispanics (e.g. diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), left ventricular hypertrophy, and gestational diabetes mellitus); 3) describe the transformation of health-related risk and protective factors related to migration, acculturation, and length of time living in the U.S.; 4) assess the impact of socioeconomic factors, cultural values, risk behaviors, and medical care access on health in Hispanics; and 5) investigate genetic effects, gene-gene interactions, and gene-environment interactions in relation to measured phenotypes in this uniquely admixed population. These objectives will be accomplished through annual follow-up and a second examination (Visit 2) of the existing cohort. The HCHS-SOL Coordinating Center contractor shall be responsible for the tasks, including but not limited to the following: 1. Demonstrated ability to lead, coordinate, and participate in all aspects of planning of Visit 2 components of HCHS-SOL; 2. Establish and finalize subcontracts with an ECG Reading Center, Pulmonary Reading Center, Neurocognitive Reading Center and a Central Laboratory; 3. Establish and finalize working agreements with the Echocardiography Reading Center associated with HCHS-SOL; 4. Establish data entry systems to collect measures from the Visit 2 as specified in the protocol; 5. Monitor recruitment of participants and completion of Visit 2 interviews and procedures; 6. Provide central training and certifications of cohort follow-up interviewers, medical record acquisition staff, medical record abstractors and physician reviewers. 7. Oversee the acquisition and reading of ECGs on all HCHS-SOL cohort participants; the Pulmonary Reading Center to oversee the training, acquisition, quality assurance, and quality control of the spirometry measurements; the Neurocognitive Reading Center to oversee the acquisition and reading of neurocognitive tests performed by HCHS-SOL participants ages 45 years and older (approximately 3,000 per Field Center) that had these tests done at Visit 1; the Central Laboratory to oversee the training for the venipuncture, acquisition, process, aliquoting, and shipping of blood, serum, plasma and urine samples, and laboratory analyses. This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), although one (1) award is anticipated, the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The RFP, NHLBI-HV-13-05, detailing the specifics of the project as well as information pertinent to the development of an offeror&rsquo;s proposal will be available electronically on or about March 09, 2012 and may be access through the Internet at the following URL location: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#NHLBI-HV-13-05 and will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities website at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov under the NHLBI posting section. No paper copies will be available. Proposals will be due on or about May 28, 2012. <strong>It is anticipated that one (1) cost-reimbursement contract award with a base&nbsp;and&nbsp;option periods&nbsp;will be made for a total period of six years (base and all option periods)</strong>&nbsp;beginning on or about June 1, 2013.

This notice constitutes a BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). TECHNICAL POC: Mr. Nam Phan (301) 342-9359</p>
<p>I. INTRODUCTION. The NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVAIR) and the Structures and Materials Engineering Divisions under the Air Vehicle Department (AIR-4.3) are soliciting proposals for research and development (R&amp;D) concepts in the area of structures and materials to support current and future Naval Aviation needs. Concepts proposed may represent novel dedicated technologies and/or dual use of new emerging commercial technology.</p>
<p>II. BACKGROUND. The missions of the Structures and Materials Engineering Divisions of the NAVAIR Air Vehicle Department are to identify and pursue the most promising technologies within a broad spectrum of the science and engineering research communities and to develop, evaluate, and transition those technologies into NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS to impart new military capabilities. To this end, NAVAIR is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development in a variety of enabling technical areas as described below. Proposals may be either basic or applied research. Proposals that are not research, but rather integration of technologies or systems development will also be considered. Multiple awards are anticipated. The amount of resources made available to this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds. While there is no specific requirement for cost and duration of the proposed effort, it is recommended that proposer include a Phase I of no more than 18 months in length that addresses the most critical issues on the path to success. This BAA constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort. No Proposer Information Pamphlet or other additional information will be published, nor will a formal request for proposal, or other solicitation, regarding this research and development be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded. <br /><br />III. SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST. New Structures and Materials, Structural and Material Concepts, Structural Analysis, Modeling and Simulation, and Materials Processing applied to metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: development and application of new and improved structural concepts, analytical modeling and simulation, life tracking, resins, structural reinforcing fibers, core and foam materials, adhesives, and sealants/coatings for naval aviation applications; new and/or lower cost manufacturing processes for structural components (including tooling); new and novel materials, processes and design methods for structural repair; process modeling; engineered materials for low-observable applications; high temperature resins/adhesives; structural and non-structural adhesives, Applique and paint replacement film materials, environmentally compliant surface preparations for bonding, non-chromated and organic corrosion inhibitors for sealants and/or adhesives, novel approaches to toughened resins for prepregs and adhesives; composite property/life prediction and related technologies; fracture phenomena of polymers &amp; composites; galvanic corrosion ; Optical materials and coatings for aircraft transparencies and their repair; and structural and multifunctional (structure + function) materials. Ideas outside of the advertised focused areas will be considered in scope provided they have the potential for radical improvement to national security and are within the interest of the office. IV.</p>
<p>CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE. NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or non-procurement agreements (e.g. Grants, Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions). Other Transactions will be entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371, and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects. Information<br />concerning Other Transactions can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/grants.html and http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/research. Final decision on acquisition type (contract/agreement) will be made by the government. <br /><br />NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project. Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal). In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act.

***** END OF AMENDMENT 2 *****
**** AMENDMENT 1 *****
This solicitation will be conducted as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. It is anticipated that Phase 1 of the solicitation will be posted on the Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD) Contracts website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/ on or about February 1, 2012. 
***** END OF AMENDMENT 1 *****
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for the design and construction of a three-story office building addition to its facility in Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina. The gross area for this planned building is estimated at 51,300 - 74,200 square feet. The project will be designed and constructed toward achieving a LEED New Construction certification. The estimated design-build price is under $10 million, and the anticipated period of performance is 24 months after contract award. 
The design-build scope of work includes architectural, engineering, construction, security, and other related services such as site work and site utilities, permitting, testing, and inspection during construction. In addition to office space, the new building will house a tissue archive freezer farm, a room for electronic data storage silos, and storage space for scientific equipment. The project will also include a landscaped exterior courtyard. 
This procurement is being conducted using the two-phase design-build selection procedures set forth in FAR Subpart 36.3. A single solicitation shall be issued covering both phases. Proposals will be evaluated in Phase 1 to determine which offerors will submit proposals for Phase 2. Phase 1 evaluation factors will include technical approach (but not detailed design or technical information), and technical qualifications, including past performance. After evaluating Phase 1 proposals, the Contracting Officer shall select the most highly qualified offerors (not to exceed three) and request that only those shortlisted offerors submit Phase 2 proposals. 
Phase 2 of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15, and shall include Phase 2 evaluation factors developed in accordance with FAR 15.304 and FAR 36.303-2. Phase 2 shall require submission of technical and price proposals by the three shortlisted offerors. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.
A single firm-fixed-price, design-build contract will be awarded using FAR Part 15 procedures. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220. All responsible sources may submit a Phase 1 proposal, which will be considered by EPA. It is expected that Phase 1 of the solicitation will be posted on the Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD) Contracts website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/ on or about November 16, 2011.

Region 7 East includes Arkansas, Louisiana and parts of East Texas with Region 7 West being the secondary area. Region 7 West includes Oklahoma, New Mexico, Texas/New Mexico border areas, Dallas/Fort Worth, and South Central Texas. This procurement is set-aside exclusively for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVO). The North American Industry Classification System code applicable to this acquisition is 562910, Environmental Remediation Services with&nbsp;employees size standard of 500. The Product/Service Code is F108, Environmental Systems Protections-Environmental Remediation. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration at http://www.ccr.gov and have completed On-line Representations and Certifications at https://orca.bpn.gov
<p><br />This procurement is an IDIQ Contract for asbestos abatement and mold remediation in government-owned buildings; GSA controlled or leased buildings in various counties/parishes in Region 7 East. The asbestos abatement and mold remediation IDIQ contract is for a period of one (1) year from Notice to Proceed, with four 1-year options, not to exceed five years. The maximum ordering limitation is up to $1,000,000 per year. The guaranteed minimum is $1,000 for the base year ONLY. A bid guarantee will be required in the amount of $200,000. The successful firm will be required to support all locations within Region 7 East. The successful firm shall have the capability to perform asbestos abatement and mold remediation services work at several sites simultaneously and handle large projects in Region 7 East. It is possible to have more than one project in progress at any one given time or location within that area during the term of the contract. Contractors shall have the capability to respond rapidly on an emergency as-needed basis.</p>
<p>The asbestos abatement and mold remediation services includes all abatement and remediation activities, but may require the contractor to conduct site surveys, provide determination for confirmation of asbestos/mold scope of work on-site, take bulk samples of suspected asbestos containing materials (i.e. ACM), and prepare reports on the results of the site surveys. Projects will primarily involve asbestos abatement and mold remediation, but may also include selective demolition. The successful firm shall have a minimum of five (5) years experience as licensed asbestos and mold contractor in at least one or more of the following states: Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. All work performed under this contract shall be performed by licensed asbestos/mold parties (either a prime contractor and/or key subcontractor) that is licensed in the state and/or municipality in which the work is to be performed. Proof of licensing and of the requisite experience will be verified prior to awarding a contract, or any delivery order issued under the contract.</p>
<p>The Government may or may not hold discussions on technical proposals (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a); therefore, the offeror's proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer (CO) later determines them to be necessary. The Government is not limited to contacting only those references provided by the offeror. The Government may also consider the offeror's performance on contracts not submitted by the offeror that the Government is aware of, or becomes aware of.</p>
<p>The offerors must provide an environmental impact plan that addresses how they plan to reduce the environmental impact of the products and services provided during performance of the resultant contract. The offerors should address the following topics, if applicable, in their Environmental Impact Plan:<br />&bull; Ongoing Consumable Products<br />&bull; Durable Good Products<br />&bull; Facility Alteration and Addition Base Building Element Products<br />&bull; Cleaning Equipment Products<br />&bull; Cleaning Supply Products<br />&bull; Concession Products<br />&bull; Other Green Products<br />&bull; Use of Green Transportation/Meetings<br />&bull; Voluntary Green Consensus Standards/Product Certifications<br />&bull; Use of Recycled Materials<br />&bull; Plan to Minimize, Reuse, or Recycle Project Materials<br />&bull; Additional Miscellaneous Green Practices</p>
<p>In addressing each category, the offerors must describe how their plan will meet the scope of work requirements and whether their approach will reduce the environmental impact beyond the requirements of the scope of work. The offeror that proposes green products and services beyond the requirements of the scope of work that will likely reduce the overall environmental impact of the project will be evaluated higher.</p>
<p>The offerors must identify up to three (3) projects similar in size, scope, and complexity where they have implemented green products and services during the performance of a project that reduced the environmental impact of the project. For each project, the offerors must provide the following information: <br />&bull; Dollar value of the prime contracts<br />&bull; Date of contracts start and completion, including options<br />&bull; Type of contracts (firm fixed price, incentive fee, time and materials, etc.)<br />&bull; Description of the green products and services implemented and how they reduced the environmental impact of the projects<br />&bull; Name, title, address, and current telephone number of the building's owner or a representative of the owner who can attest to the acceptability of the services provided</p>
<p>The offerors will be evaluated based on how well they will successfully implement green products and services required in the contracts. Offerors shall be evaluated higher on a project where the offeror's implementation of green products and services reduced the environmental impact of the project beyond the requirements of the contract.</p>
<p>The offerors must provide up to two (2) references for each project listed. For each reference, the contractor must include the reference's name, title, project, email address, and telephone number. If no references are provided for a project, that project will not be evaluated. The government is not required to ensure that an equal number of references be obtained.</p>
<p>In addition, the government may consider the offeror's past performance on any other relevant contract within the past five (5) years, of which the government has knowledge or becomes aware of as a result of references or other means.</p>
<p>This negotiated procurement will be accomplished by using FAR Part 15.3, Source Selection Procedures, which will result in the award of a firm-fixed price contract. Technical abilities shall be significantly more important than price. Offerors will be evaluated in the following order: (1) Environmental impact plan; (2) Experience and past performance of prime contractor and key subcontractors; (2) Experience, past performance and qualifications of key personnel; (3) Management/technical approach.</p>
<p>Offerors will not be reimbursed for proposal submittal expenses. The Government furnished line item listing in this contract will be the primary ordering source. If the awarded firm refuses to accept work for any line item included in a task order issued under this IDIQ contract the government will deem this to be a material breach of the contract and may terminate the contract for cause, without additional expense to the government. Any documents related to this procurement will be available via the Internet only. No hard copies will be available. Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of all documents. These documents will be in .pdf (Adobe Acrobat) format and will be available at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about February 23, 2012. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any information or documents in the special notices, the solicitation and amendments, if any. Offerors can also register to be notified by e-mail of new postings including synopsis, solicitations, and amendments at the site. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. We encourage offerors to periodically check the site; it is the offeror's responsibility to make sure you have all of the documents related to the procurement. This procurement is being made under the Small Business Demonstration Program.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal conference will tentatively be scheduled for February 29, 2012, to answer questions offerors may have concerning the specifications and technical evaluation criteria. A specific time and location will be issued with the solicitation. Attendance at the pre-proposal conference is not mandatory.</p>

<p>The asbestos abatement and mold remediation services includes all abatement and remediation activities, but may require the contractor to conduct site surveys, provide determination for confirmation of asbestos/mold scope of work on-site, take bulk samples of suspected asbestos containing materials (i.e. ACM), and prepare reports on the results of the site surveys.

All work performed under this contract shall be performed by licensed asbestos/mold parties (either a prime contractor and/or key subcontractor) that is licensed in the state and/or municipality in which the work is to be performed. Proof of licensing and of the requisite experience will be verified prior to awarding a contract, or any delivery order issued under the contract.</p>
<p>The Government may or may not hold discussions on technical proposals (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a); therefore, the offeror's proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer (CO) later determines them to be necessary. The Government is not limited to contacting only those references provided by the offeror. The Government may also consider the offeror's performance on contracts not submitted by the offeror that the Government is aware of, or becomes aware of.</p>
<p>The offerors must provide an environmental impact plan that addresses how they plan to reduce the environmental impact of the products and services provided during performance of the resultant contract. The offerors should address the following topics, if applicable, in their Environmental Impact Plan:<br />&bull; Ongoing Consumable Products<br />&bull; Durable Good Products<br />&bull; Facility Alteration and Addition Base Building Element Products<br />&bull; Cleaning Equipment Products<br />&bull; Cleaning Supply Products<br />&bull; Concession Products<br />&bull; Other Green Products<br />&bull; Use of Green Transportation/Meetings<br />&bull; Voluntary Green Consensus Standards/Product Certifications<br />&bull; Use of Recycled Materials<br />&bull; Plan to Minimize, Reuse, or Recycle Project Materials<br />&bull; Additional Miscellaneous Green Practices</p>
<p>In addressing each category, the offerors must describe how their plan will meet the scope of work requirements and whether their approach will reduce the environmental impact beyond the requirements of the scope of work. The offeror that proposes green products and services beyond the requirements of the scope of work that will likely reduce the overall environmental impact of the project will be evaluated higher.</p>
<p>The offerors must identify up to three (3) projects similar in size, scope, and complexity where they have implemented green products and services during the performance of a project that reduced the environmental impact of the project. For each project, the offerors must provide the following information: <br />&bull; Dollar value of the prime contracts<br />&bull; Date of contracts start and completion, including options<br />&bull; Type of contracts (firm fixed price, incentive fee, time and materials, etc.)<br />&bull; Description of the green products and services implemented and how they reduced the environmental impact of the projects<br />&bull; Name, title, address, and current telephone number of the building's owner or a representative of the owner who can attest to the acceptability of the services provided</p>
<p>The offerors will be evaluated based on how well they will successfully implement green products and services required in the contracts. Offerors shall be evaluated higher on a project where the offeror's implementation of green products and services reduced the environmental impact of the project beyond the requirements of the contract.</p>
<p><br />The offerors must provide up to two (2) references for each project listed. For each reference, the contractor must include the reference's name, title, project, email address, and telephone number. If no references are provided for a project, that project will not be evaluated. The government is not required to ensure that an equal number of references be obtained.</p>
<p>In addition, the government may consider the offeror's past performance on any other relevant contract within the past five (5) years, of which the government has knowledge or becomes aware of as a result of references or other means.</p>
<p>This negotiated procurement will be accomplished by using FAR Part 15.3, Source Selection Procedures, which will result in the award of a firm-fixed price contract. Technical abilities shall be significantly more important than price. Offerors will be evaluated in the following order: (1) Environmental impact plan; (2) Experience and past performance of prime contractor and key subcontractors; (2) Experience, past performance and qualifications of key personnel; (3) Management/technical approach.</p>
<p>Offerors will not be reimbursed for proposal submittal expenses. The Government furnished line item listing in this contract will be the primary ordering source. If the awarded firm refuses to accept work for any line item included in a task order issued under this IDIQ contract the government will deem this to be a material breach of the contract and may terminate the contract for cause, without additional expense to the government. Any documents related to this procurement will be available via the Internet only. No hard copies will be available. Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of all documents. These documents will be in .pdf (Adobe Acrobat) format and will be available at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about February 23, 2012. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any information or documents in the special notices, the solicitation and amendments, if any. Offerors can also register to be notified by e-mail of new postings including synopsis, solicitations, and amendments at the site.

<DESC>Notice to interested parties.  The government is seeking final questions/comments regarding the DRAFT solicitation for Interment Flags.  Attached is the DRAFT that incorporates the results of the question and answer session.  

The anticipated date for the government's receipt of proposals is on or about 29 February 2012.

Answers to Questions 18 and 19:

18.Question: A contradiction exists in the Commercial Item Description A-A-52696 as it relates to the Header cloth. In paragraph 2.1 the CID states the weight of the Duck is to be 8.5 oz. minimum per square yard. In paragraph 2.1.5 the CID states the weight to be 7 ounces to 8.25 ounces per square yard. Please confirm that the Duck cloth acceptable range for the Duck cloth remains 7 to 8.5 ounces per square yard. 

Answer:  See below.

19.Question: Under the current production contracts for the Interment Flag Para. 2.1.6 of the Commercial Item Description was modified to state "the looper thread must be on the white portion of the flag". Please confirm that this modification will remain valid for the current RFP. 

Answer: The CID is amended:

The specifications are the same as those in Federal Specification CID-A-A-52696 except as noted: 

NOTE: 2.1 The Standard for Yarns per inch, Warp, Duck, reads 84 for Cotton and Cotton-Polyester. This standard is revised for this requirement to 34 yarns per inch for Cotton and Cotton-Polyester. 
NOTE: 2.1.5 Heading is modified to specify the duck will be a minimum of 8.5 oz per square yard IAW paragraph 2.1 
NOTE: 2.1.6 Stitching. Paragraph is modified to state, "the looper thread must be on the white portion of the flag". 
NOTE: 3.2 First Article Testing Samples. 6 complete interment flags shall be submitted for first article testing after contract award. 
NOTE: 5.3 References to NSNs are removed


Final questions are due NLT 4:00PM EST February 14, 2012. Any questions or comments must be emailed to jesse.hardy@va.gov and patrick.mckeown@va.gov.  Please note, all questions and answers will be posted to this site and publicly available.  Interested party company names will be redacted from any postings.

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME.

<a href="mailto:patrick.mckeown@va.gov">Supervisory Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>Introduction: The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA), Office of Acquisition and Operations (OAO), Strategic Acquisitions Center (SAC), Fredericksburg VA is issuing a Sources Sought Notice/Request for Information for Service Dog Insurance. THIS IS NOT AN ORDER, SOLICITATION, OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. This announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation for services. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be made as a result of this announcement. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized and posted at www.fbo.gov. 

Your response to this Sources Sought announcement will assist the VA in determining the best acquisition solution to ensure robust competition, and ultimately the best valued solution for the VA Service Animal Health Insurance requirement. This announcement is specifically targeted for interested, qualified businesses that can provide animal health insurance across the Continental United States (CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam and potentially the Philippines. 

Background: Service/guide dogs are considered a prosthetic device in the VA system. They serve as a critical component of rehabilitation and can be part of the treatment plans for Disabled Veterans. Veterans that acquire service and guide dogs for significant visual, hearing, and mobility impairments may apply for and be awarded VHA veterinary benefits under current regulations. Just as we would maintain or repair another prosthetic device, we provide payment for veterinary care for service/guide dogs. We are seeking a vehicle such as pet insurance to control costs and maintain consistency. 

Objectives: 
Award Service Animal Health Insurance contract vehicle(s) to provide comprehensive commercial medical insurance coverage for service dogs of eligible veterans. Currently, there are approximately 600 dogs that are part of this program. This number is likely to increase. 

The animal medical insurance provider shall accept "all comers". Thereby, all dogs will be covered under the policy regardless of breed, age, and the hereditary conditions associated with them. 

The insurance will ensure that the VA, not the veteran, be billed for any premiums, copayments, or deductibles associated with the policy. 

The policy will feature dental coverage (sedated teeth cleaning when necessary) for all service dogs. 

The policy will cover both well dog and emergency care for all service dogs.

Well Dog coverage will include: 
--Yearly check-up/physical 
--Dental coverage, i.e., teeth cleaning (with sedation when deemed necessary) 
--Immunizations 

Emergency Care will include coverage for: 
--All pre-existing conditions such as hip dysplasia, 
--Diagnostic tests, surgeries, prescription medications, (including hereditary and congenital disorders) 
--Euthanasia and cremation services 

For additional information on the requirement, please see the Federal Register posting at: https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/06/16/2011-14933/service-dogs

Questions: 

What is the feasibility of providing medical insurance coverage to all dogs, regardless of breed, age, and hereditary conditions? Is there an established age range for working dogs? 

Would it be more efficient and effective to provide insurance on a regional basis? Market research has indicated animal insurance prices are relative to geographic location. What is the geographic range your company can cover? What are limitations of an insurance company providing coverage overseas? 

In responding to this announcement please include the following: 
Name of Company 
Contact Information 
Business Size: Please indicate your business size (Large or Small). If you happen to be a small business, please indicate your size standard and small business socio-economic sub-categories that represent your business; are you a Service Disable Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, Woman-Owned? Indicate any sub-categories that apply. 

Interested parties may respond to this notice via e-mail to 
jesse.hardy@va.gov 
and 
regina.mcgregor@va.gov. 

Responses are requested by February 16, 2012.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification (1) to Synopsis VA118-12-R-0196 is to clarify the description of the effort detailed below.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Acquisition Operations (OAO), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), located at 260 Industrial Way West, Eatontown, New Jersey 07724 intends to enter into a contract on a basis of other than full and open competition for the TAC Information Technology (IT) Department.  The TAC intends to award an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ), firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract to Tridec Technologies, LLC, 4674 Fishburg Road Suite C, Dayton, Ohio 45424, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, for the development of the Acquisition Business System (ABS) Customer Acquisition Portal (CAP).  ABS is comprised of the Virtual Office of Acquisition (VOA) and the integration of VOA with other VA contracting systems (eCMS, ITARS, etc).   CAP will encompass re-engineering and streamlining of VOA to ensure customers and contracting individuals have access to the tools they require to manage contract actions through the acquisition lifecycle.  CAP will allow OAO customers to manage contract information, provide insight into the contracting lifecycle, and provide accessibility to contracting information and opportunities to the public and vendor communities.  CAP will also provide enhanced capabilities beyond existing disparate systems, reduce duplicative data entry, and provide a flexible, scalable, modular framework that will allow for a secure, cost effective expansion of the system capacity and functionality.  The anticipated ceiling of the proposed IDIQ, FFP acquisition is $4,800,000.00, with an ordering period of 24 months.  Estimated date of award for this action is February 29, 2012.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) or 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-5 entitled, "Authorized or required by statute," pursuant to the authority of Public Law 109-461, codified at 38 U.S.C. 8127.  The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) for this effort is 541511. Custom application development and knowledge of Federal acquisition business processes are a requirement for successful performance of this contract.  This notification shall close on February 13, 2012. Questions/responses shall be submitted via e-mail to Contract Specialist, Matthew Truex, matthew.truex@va.gov, with the subject line as the synopsis number, VA118-12-R-0196.  The Point of Contacts (POCs) for this action are Matthew Truex, Contract Specialist, 732-440-9650 and Jan Oberdick,

<AWARDEE>Noridian Administrative Services, 900 42nd Street, Fargo, ND 58103 US
<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents award of a modification to the existing contractor Noridian Administrative Services under the current contract number HHSM-500-2011-M0004Z in the amount of $31,658 authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals. <br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011.</p>
<p>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<DESC>The sole source determination is based upon the fact that Cisbio Bioassays US does not distribute this item to any other resellers; as such, Cisbio Bioassays US is the sole provider of this particular reagent. Additionally, the pSer473 AKT HTRF&reg; Cisbio assay consists of reagents labeled proprietary fluorophores. Akt is an important kinase enzyme involved in cell growth, survival, proliferation and differentiation. Phosphorylation of AKT at the amino acid Ser473 is a critical regulatory step of AKT activity. NCGC has done extensive work to miniaturize the assay to 1536-well format and demonstrated that it produces robust data using the HTS capabilities at NCGC by doing pilot screens with small compound collections. The current HTRF&reg; Cisbio assay is ready for HTS at NCGC. At this moment, there is no alternative assay available to measure pSer473 AKT that would allow NCGC to screen of a large collection of compounds (400,000). NCGC must use the same variables in the assays to maintain integrity from the data and to achieve the desired outcomes. This item has been purchased in the past from this vendor only, as no one else can provide these specific reagents. All the assay optimization was performed with the HTRF&reg; kits. Going forward, the screening needs to be done with the same reagents in order to yield comparable and readily interpretable results. A switch to a different detection reagent would necessitate re-optimizing the assay with no guarantees that the results would be similar. This would entail unacceptable substantial time delays and enormous additional costs.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, had an urgent requirement for upgrades to an already purchased Skytron Skyvision system.  Construction is ongoing and upgrades were necessary to allow the system to function in the designed space.  This acquisition was conducted under the authority of FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency.  The Justification and Approval is attached.
Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  

Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 01, 523 - Boston Healthcare System 
Purchase Request Transaction Number: 523-12-2-7821-0038

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  

This for the procurement of the add-ons for the Skytron Skyvision system from the vendor REOS Medical.   This is will be a new contract provided to the vendor. 

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  

The commodities being procured are add-ons for the Skytron Skyvision system which include a 200FT cabling kit and all required components, keyboards for the Skytron Booms (already purchased) and a touch panel controller for the Skytron Skyvision system. These are needed to meet the needs for the booms being installed in the Gastrointestinal Clinic, currently under construction. 
The estimated cost for each unit varies, however the total estimate value of the acquisition is $55,506.38, including all fees.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

The Skytron products being purchased through REOS Medical (approved Skytron Distributor) can only be purchased through them because the Skytron equipment that the add-ons are going to be used has already been procured and therefore only the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) can provide the required add-ons for the Skytron system.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

The add-on products being procured are for the Skytron system that has been purchased already. Therefore no efforts were made to solicit alternate sources, since the main system is already purchased.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

     	 Pricing is fair and reasonable from REOS Medical based on a 6.4% discount & credit offered to the 	Government over pricing offered to their other commercial customers. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

No market research was conducted due to the fact the main components of the add-on equipment being procured is already been purchased from the OEM's distributor, and only the OEM's add-ons will work with the Skytron system already purchased. 

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

All facts provided in previous sections. 

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  

The only source expressing interest in the acquisition is REOS Medical, a distributor of Skytron.  

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  

At this time no additional actions are planned because the equipment is add-ons to the main equipment already procured. For future requirements, market research will be conducted to see if other companies in the industry have developed like products.

<p><br />1.IDENTIFICATION OF THE REQUIRING AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:</p>
<p>a. Requesting Activity:</p>
<p>Information and Technology Shared Services<br />ATTN: DFAS-ZTAAA<br />1240 East Ninth Street<br />Cleveland, OH 44199-2055<br />Richard A. LaRue, Room 2229</p>
<p><br />b. Contracting Activity</p>
<p>DFAS Indianapolis<br />Contract Services Directorate<br />8899 East 56th Street<br />Indianapolis, IN 46249</p>
<p><br />2. NATURE OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION:</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to obtain the necessary approvals for a limited source acquisition in accordance with FAR Part 8.405-6. "Limited source" in this case pertains to the award of a logical follow-on task order for the continuation of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Financial Integration Systems Support (DFISS) III systems support in TSO-CL. The provision for a logical follow-on can be found at FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C) and FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C). This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program, Title III of the Federal Property and Administration Services Act of 1949. This exception has been used four (4) times.</p>
<p><br />3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICE:</p>
<p>1. The DFISS III Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) were awarded in April 2007 to fulfill a continuing need for DFAS system support. DFAS-CL provides DFAS with software and technology support. DFAS-TSO-CL supports the DFAS mission and other selected outside customers. The implementation of DFAS standard systems requires project and program management support, analytical, technical, and programming support as well as the writing of programs to support database administration. Due to varying systems at each site, several types of abilities are required for the required tasks. Systems analysis skills are required for a variety of languages and processes. Technical analysis of hardware platforms including mainframe, mid-tier, as well as personal computers, is also needed. This Task Order will provide DFAS with contractor support to include the following systems: Customer Support Center (CSC); Garnishment Systems and Imaging Development Branch; Imaging-Transportation (IMG-TRANS); The Standard Accounting and Reporting System Financial Departmental Reporting/Major Command Reporting (STARS FDR/MCR) System; The Cash Accounting Systems to include - International Balance of Payments System (IBOP), Suspense/Aging Monitoring System (SAMS), Check Recertification System (RECERT), Navy Prompt Payment Interest System (NPPI), Cash Reconciliation System (CRS), Financial Operations Support System (FOS); Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS); Defense MilPay Office (DMO); Computer Associates (CA) Software Support; WEB Application Development; DFAS Program Budget System (DPBS); Defense Working Capital Accounting System (DWAS); Defense Departmental Reporting System (DDRS); Salary Offset Reporting System (SORS); Central Database (CDB); Transportation Support System (TSS); Defense Workload Operations Web System (DWOWS); Automated Disbursing System (ADS); Ask Modules; Payroll Quality Review (PQR); Integrated Garnishment System (IGS); Adoption Reimbursement System (ARS) Work Year Personnel Cost (WYPC); Support for BRAC Systems transitioned to Cleveland, Applications; Defense Financial Reporting Reconciliation System (DFRRS); Disbursing Systems; Closed Accounts Adjustment Tools (CAATs)/Agent Desktop/Call Recording/ePortal; Transformation Project Systems; My Metrics. Electronic Certification System (ECS) and Deposits in Transit (DIT); Automated Disbursing System/Strategic Disbursing Initiative (ADS/SDI); BRAC Program Management Support is also required for the administrative duties of Systems Engineering Process Group (SEPG) support is required for Task 6, Software Process Management. In addition, there may be support required for other additional DFAS systems, but this option under the Task Order will only be used if required by the government.</p>
<p>The Total Estimated Value is $6,657,821.30..</p>
<p>The Period of Performance is February 1, 2012 through January 31, 2013.<br /><br />4. PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>The DFISS III BPAs were awarded to provide technology support and consistency only if the Contractor performs satisfactorily. The BPAs were competed and awards were based on best value factors including technical experience, past performance, management, staffing, and cost/price. Per FAR 8.405-3(c)(2), all new requirements were initially competed between the four BPA holders. The BPA terms specified that subsequent awards for the same services would not be recompeted, but logical follow-on orders will be awarded after a determination of satisfactory performance has been made. In addition, task order cost/price will be reviewed to ensure the new proposed rates are consistent with BPA awards, which were determined to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>In this case, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services (HPES) is the incumbent. HPES currently has a staff of approximately 55 people with 4 vacancies. This staff supports numerous systems for TSO-CL and DFAS. TSO-CL relies on the staff for their technical qualifications and system knowledge and cannot risk the personnel disruption of a recompetition every year. The primary reason for establishing a five-year BPA with the understanding that follow-on orders would be awarded was to avoid the risk of the learning curve, as well as improving staff retention. One of the subfactors in the BPA evaluation was staff retention.</p>
<p>5. DETERMINATION OF BEST VALUE</p>
<p>The award of the initial task order for TSO-CL was competed between the four BPA holders on a best value basis. Two proposals were received. Electronic Data Systems (now HPES) was awarded that order. Per the terms of the BPA, a logical follow-on will be awarded. The BPA pricing was competed, resulting in fair and reasonable rates for the 5-year ordering period. Because the task order was competed, resulting in fair and reasonable rates for the base year; and since the follow-on is increasing at a percentage already evaluated for the BPA award, the rates for this task order can be considered fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET SURVEY</p>
<p>The market survey for the BPA competition revealed numerous companies with potential capability for these services. The BPA RFQ was posted on GSA e-Buy for all qualified companies to consider. Five quotes were received. Four BPAs were awarded. The BPA holders have included numerous small and small disadvantaged businesses in their portfolios to use in conjunction with their own capabilities.</p>
<p>7. ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS</p>
<p>This order is allowable to be issued on a limited-source basis based on the satisfactorily performance of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services, LLC and in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the BPA. Initially all FSS 70 schedule holders were provided fair opportunity to establish a BPA. In turn, all BPA awardees were then given a fair opportunity to be considered for the initial task order. The use of a logical follow-on is justified because the same work is continuing and there is a continuing need for contractor support. The inclusion of priced options was not considered viable since the Statement of Work is updated from year to year which results in different numbers of hours per labor category. The SOW changes from year to year are within scope of the base year, in that as some system work is minimized, other systems may be bolstered. The inclusion of priced options was not considered viable since the Statement of Work is updated from year to year which results in different numbers of hours per labor category.</p>
<p>8. ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMPETITION (Efforts to obtain competition)</p>
<p>See Paragraph 6 above. The BPA awards were competed and resulted in pricing below the GSA schedule; then, the initial task order awards were competed between the BPA holders resulting in further reduction in rates. The BPA instructions notified the holders that subsequent task orders for the same services would not be recompeted, but that logical follow-ons would be awarded.</p>

<DESC>The intended source is the incumbent contractor, SOS International, Ltd.  Prior to contract expiration in September 2011, several 12-month task orders were issued with the intent to incrementally fund the orders with FY11 and FY12 money.  However, not all the work was included due to an oversight.  The purpose of this notice is to inform industry of our intent to place the omitted work on the task orders on a sole source basis.  The task orders provide intelligence technical support services for 12 months until completion of the full and open competition for a replacement contract. Any interested party must provide intelligence analysts with a minimum clearance of SECRET; however most positions require a TS/SCI to provide services at government facilities in Central and Eastern Europe and the continent of Africa. A lapse in service would jeopardize the mission. The government intends to award a short-term follow-on contract consisting of a 4-month mobilization period, 12 months base period, and 2 six-month option periods.  The Government estimates that the time required for full and open competition for the short-term follow-on contract will be 4-6 months. <br><br>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by this agency. <br><br>A follow-on competitive action is in process.<br>

In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), the circumstance restricting competition for this acquisition is that only one source is capable of providing the services required at the level of quality required because the services are unique or highly specialized. The current task order was competitively solicited and awarded and the modification to extend services is necessary to prevent a gap in services while the positions are being converted to Federal positions. Additionally, the Government needs BAH to transition out as federal employees transition in over the 3 month period. Transition to a new contractor for this short duration would involve disruptive transition efforts, personnel security clearance processing, and a need to brief and indoctrinate new contractor personnel. The time and expense associated with a new contractor would be cost prohibitive. No other company except BAH can provide transition services except BAH as the services provided are unique to BAH.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<DESC>Limited Sources Justification
For Federal Supply Schedules Award (FAR 8.4)


1.	Identification of the agency and contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Limited Source Justification":  Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Acquisition and Logistics, Washington DC plans to contract by means other than full and open competition.  This document sets forth the justification and approval for award of a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) on a limited source basis as required by FAR 8.405-6.

2.	Nature and/or description of action being approved:  The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) proposes to award a noncompetitive Task Order with HOV Services, Incorporated (HOV) for scanning and indexing of the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) and Principal Guardianship Claims Folders (PGF).  This award will be issued as a task order against the established Federal Supply Schedule Group Contract 36; Special Item Numbers (SIN) 51 409 Network, Optical Imaging Systems and Solutions and 51 506 Document Conversion Services. 

3.	A description of supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including estimated value):	The VA VBA has a critical need to contract for scanning and indexing services.  The period of performance will consist of a base period of two (2) months (starting on February 10, 2012) and one (1) option period of two (2) months (estimated dollar value of base and option period is $1.9 Million).

The scanning and indexing services will require the Contractor to utilize individuals with the appropriate levels of facility security (ITOC cleared), cleared personnel, and ISO approved telecommunications connections to perform the required tasks without delay and/or interruption.  

The contractor will be required to prepare, scan, index, certify the quality of the work product, and transmit a copy of the electronic record back to the VBA via secure means.  The contractor will also be required to fund the to/from shipping cost for the source records from as many as 250 different sites in the continental United States and overseas, following scanning, return them to specified  locations including overseas locations as instructed by VBA.  The contractor shall adhere to established VA physical security policy while in possession of records and shall also adhere to the VBA Scanning Business Rules.

4.	Identification of the justification rationale: FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A) - An urgent or compelling need exists due to the Government needing additional time to award a replacement contract.  The incumbent contractor is the only vendor available who can provide the task without a break in service for processing the Veteran's benefits claims.  

38 CFR 3.100 mandates VBA to process disability benefit claims submitted by Veterans and by active duty service members preparing to separate from military service.  Disruption of scanning and indexing services will negatively impact claims processing for VBA.  Processing claims in the BDD process is critical to meeting the needs of our returning service members from Afghanistan and Iraq who are discharged from active duty service.  Currently, an average of 550 BDD files is scanned per week.  A break in service would cause a delay in processing and a backlog would quickly build up of BDD claims that were unable to be worked.

BDD folder scanning allows for prompt processing without the need to move paper within the claims environment, thus providing for more efficient and timely services. 

Scanning PGF is necessary due to the recent change to consolidate the Fiduciary Program into national hubs, which all field examiners and legal instrument examiners conduct their daily business using virtual information.  Without this foundation and transmission to Virtual VA, the business process of managing the fiduciary program which protects the most vulnerable veterans, will be adversely affected.  Approximately 450 PGFs are currently scanned each week.

On December 16, 2011, VA received a protest of award of contract #VA 101-12-A-0001.  The basis of the protest was the VA's exclusion of the VBA Scanning Business Rules (Rules) from the solicitation.  These Rules must be followed to properly scan and index VBA claim files.  As a result of the protest, VA was required to take corrective action.  Amendment #16 to the solicitation was issued on January 5, 2012 to incorporate the Rules and request a revised technical/price proposal.  The due date for the revised proposals was established as January 11, 2012.  Based on questions from vendors, another amendment must be issued.  The revised receipt date is anticipated for close-of-business January 16, 2012.  Upon completion of the requisite technical evaluation, which is estimated to take approximately two business days, and upon completion of anticipated discussions, the estimated award date is February 29, 2012.

The new FSS Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) anticipated to be awarded on or about February 29, 2012, requires a minimum of 60 (sixty) days to transition from the current vendor's contract to a new contract.  Therefore, this "bridge task order" to the incumbent contractor will require the current vendor to support the transition with planning and record keeping services.  Neither activity can begin until a new task order is award.  

HOV is uniquely qualified as the incumbent contractor to perform these services for the initial sixty (60) day period while VBA awards and implements a new scanning and indexing system of the BDD and PGF.  A new vendor may require significant transition time to obtain the security clearances for its personnel, gain an understanding of VA's business process, set up equipment, index scanning values, and evaluate the outputs for quality and timeliness, which are critical to the success of VBA's business processes. 

Further, any disruption to this service which is vital to the processing of Veterans' benefits as a result of transitioning to a vendor other than HOV, will inflate the backlog of benefits claims and will be in conflict with the VA Secretary's Major Initiative to enable 21st century benefits delivery and services.  The benefits claims adjusters are virtual employees, thereby requiring all claims to be scanned and indexed to be processed without delay.

5.	A determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 8.404(d):  The anticipated price to the Government is approximately $1.9 million for a base period of two (2) months and one (1) option period of two (2) months. GSA has already determined the prices to be fair and reasonable under fixed price schedule contracts. By placing an order against a schedule contract, the Contracting Officer concluded the order represents the best benefit to the Government and results in the lowest overall cost alternative. Also, a comparison of the vendor's proposed price, historical cost from previous contracts shows, and Government estimate reflects the average cost for this task. 

6.	A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted:  Market research was conducted by searching General Services Administration's website for FSS contractors that can provide scanning and indexing support under schedule 36, SIN 51 409 and SIN 51 506. Several contractors have been identified but are not immediately available for a 60 day performance period. The unanticipated receipt of an award protest requiring corrective action in the form of an amendment to incorporate the missing technical information as detailed in paragraph four above imposed an award delay thereby requiring the incumbent to continue performing this work.  There is not sufficient time to compete this "bridge order" pursuant to the terms and conditions of FAR Part 8.4 and ensure there is not a disruption to these vital services. Further, the associated costs for a new contractor to "start-up" this project vs. maintaining the existing structure of the incumbent contractor (such as contractor's associated cost for obtaining the necessary personnel and installing a new scanning equivalent system) would not be cost beneficial to the VA. Therefore, the existing FSS contractor, HOV Services Inc. has the resources available to provide the task without interruption or additional cost. 

7.	Any other facts supporting the justification: The Contracting Officer has determined that no other vendor has the immediate resources, skilled personnel for installing an equivalent new system to support the VA for a two (2) month period.  This task order will allow time for the VA to complete a competitive acquisition that is in progress intended to support the VA's long-term needs.  Any delay to this service will interrupt VA's claims rating and be detrimental to those Veterans pending results of their claims.

8.	A statement of the action, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that lead to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made:  The Government has future requirements for these specific services. This office intends to establish a three year BPA against an established General Services Administration Contract under Schedule 36 -- The Office, Imaging And Document Solution, Special Item Numbers 51 409 Network, Optical Imaging Systems and Solutions and 51 506 Document Conversion Services in accordance with FAR Subpart 8.405-3 BPAs during the period that this requirement is in place. 

 
9.	Approvals in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(d): 
Contracting Officer's Certification:  I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Legal Sufficiency Certification:   I have reviewed this justification and find it legally    sufficient to support the limiting of sources as allowed by FAR Subpart 8.405-6(b)(3) - An urgent or compelling need exists, and following the FSS ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays.
