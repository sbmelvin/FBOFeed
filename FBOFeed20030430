<SUBJECT>B--A contract to uprade the MMS Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Economic Impact Models (EIM) for the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and the Alaska OCS.
<SOLNBR>0103RP72470

<CONTACT>Sharon Teger Business Specialist 7037871263     sharon.teger@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior intends to competitively award a contract to upgrade its Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Economic Impact Models (EIM) for the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and the Alaska OCS and HEREBY SOLICITS CAPABILITY STATEMENTS from parties interested in bidding for the contract. PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  INTRODUCTION: The Government intends to award a cost reimbursement-type contract for service. The period of performance is estimated to be 20 months from the effective date of the contract.  The short title of the study will be OCS Economic Impact Models Upgrade.  BACKGROUND:  The MMS has developed two sets of regional economic impact models to be used for various analyses at the national, the regional, and the individual project levels.  The models use a consistent approach that helps to ensure a reasonable level of consistency from estimate to estimate but also allows for differences in the geographic, geologic, and economic environment, as well as in industry operations, from region to region.  Each OCS EIM comprises two conceptual steps.  The first step translates levels of exploration, development, production, and related activities into dollars spent, by industry sector, in each of 1-10 local affected onshore areas, Rest of the U.S., and Rest of the World.  (E.g., completion and operation of one exploration well in the Central GOM results in X amount of spending in the Steel Pipe and Tubing sector of the coastal area of Louisiana identified by MMS as LA-1.)  The second step uses IMPLAN multipliers to estimate the amount of employment, personal income, total value added, and total industry output expected to result from all spending in all sectors, by identified onshore area.  By the time the analyses begin for the next 5-year OCS oil and gas program, some of the industry expenditure data upon which the GOM models are based will be 5 10 years old and thus not reflect current technology and operations.  In addition, the models for the GOM and for the Alaska OCS differ considerably in design, level of detail, and software application.  THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY ARE to develop more consistent, up-to-date, and user-friendly OCS EIM that retain all the useful features of the current models. New cost data will be collected for the GOM models and possibly for Alaska models; the models for the two regions (GOM and Alaska) will be made more consistent in their design; and the models will be made more user friendly.  THIS STUDY CONSISTS OF FIVE (5) MAIN TASKS. In Task 1, the Contractor shall conduct a thorough review of the current OCS EIM and relevant studies.  MMS will identify and provide access to relevant MMS-sponsored studies.  This task includes becoming thoroughly familiar with the current models, their inputs, their uses, and the features that MMS staff members value in each model.  In Task 2, the Contractor shall develop the design for the new models, as well as the approach to data collection.  The new OCS EIM must retain the benefits of the existing models.  Task 3 requires the actual collection of the data for GOM models and testing the validity of the current Alaska data.  Much of the data will need to be collected from individual companies and industry associations, or from organizations that have collected such data.  The data for the Alaska models is fairly recent, so data collection requirements should be minimal-but sufficient to confirm the validity of the data underlying the current models.  In Task 4, the Contractor shall create the new models, along with appropriate documentation, which shall include a user manual and report detailing data sources and data collection methodology, model structure, etc.  Task 5 requires testing of the new models to assure that they work properly.  The project will require occasional meetings with MMS staff members in Herndon, VA, New Orleans, LA, and Anchorage, AK.  HOW TO RESPOND: In order to compete for this contract, you MUST demonstrate that you are qualified to perform the work by providing, by Thursday, 22 May 2003, an original and nine (9) copies of a Capabilities Statement detailing (1) your key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and /or managing the study) with their qualifications and specific experience; (2) your organizational experience and facilities; and (3) specific references including contract number and project identifier & description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with the point of contact & telephone number and Email address for previous work of this nature that your key personnel or organization has performed within the last four years.  Provide information on which tasks each key person shall perform, and their qualifications for completing those tasks, and the rationale for that assignment.  If you believe the Government will find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your company to address the problem.  YOUR CAPABILITIES STATEMENT WILL BE EVALUATED BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FACTORS, with the importance of factors A and B weighted as indicated.  (A) Experience and Commitment of Key Personnel (60%).  (1) Education, professional credentials, knowledge, and publications in relevant disciplines. Relevant disciplines are economics (regional economic impact modeling) and social science.  Relevant knowledge includes an understanding of oil and gas activity BOTH in the Gulf of Mexico OCS AND offshore Alaska; familiarity with and/or experience building input-out models, especially with the IMPLAN system; experience building user-friendly economic models; and an understanding of how MS Excel, MS Access, and/or similar software can be used to create transparent and updatable models.  We will also assess the applicable experience of persons responsible for data management, computer programming, and writing and editing user manuals.  (2) Expertise, education, and experience to carry out the specific tasks described above.  (3) Adequacy of the proposed level of effort estimated for each person per each task.  Knowledge and experience can be demonstrated through publications as well as past contract work experience.  Assessment factors will be persons' qualifications, the relevance of their qualifications to their assigned task, and their estimated level of effort.  (B) Past Performance (40%).  This factor addresses your demonstrated ability to carry out the tasks efficiently and produce quality deliverables in a timely fashion as demonstrated by the following:  (1) Ability to adhere to budget parameters and carry out the tasks of described below under specific scheduling deadlines, while delivering high-quality products.  (2)  The degree of comparability of past projects to the current project, including number, complexity, scope, size, duration, and dollar value.  (3) Demonstrated degree of mutually beneficial cooperation between your key personnel and its clients.  Qualifications of any subcontractors or partners will also be considered in these respects.  FOLLOWING REVIEW OF ALL CAPABILITIES STATEMENTS, we will establish a list of those offerors MMS has evaluated as most qualified to perform the work. All offerors will be informed of the results of the evaluation, including an assessment of their strengths and weaknesses. A written request for proposal (RFP) will then be forwarded to those offerors deemed most qualified, instructing them on the written portion of their proposals and the oral presentation requirements.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has a need to deliver the National Highway Institute’s (NHI) existing course #134057, “Transportation Asset Management.” Transportation Asset Management is a strategic approach to managing physical transportation infrastructure. The course presents issues and recommended practices for a systematic process of preserving, upgrading and operating physical assets cost effectively. It combines engineering principles with sound business practices and economic theory, and provides tools to facilitate a more organized, logical approach to decision-making. This introductory one-day training course is targeted to the executive, top and mid management levels of a state Department of Transportation.

The resulting contract will be for two years, with three 1-year options to address continuing requirements.

This is a full and open Commercial Item solicitation being conducted under FAR Part 12 procedures. All responsible sources may submit a proposal for consideration.  

For the purpose of assisting those companies interested in this new training effort, we are taking two preliminary steps. First, we will quickly post a DRAFT of key sections of the proposed RFP. This is strictly for your information, and may be altered in any way prior to the official release of the RFP. Offerors are cautioned to use this only for planning purposes, and to read the actual RFP carefully when it is released.

Secondly, we are planning to hold a preproposal conference for interested companies at the NHI offices in Ballston, Virginia on May 22nd. The conference will be lead by the Contracting Officer and the Program Manager to both provide an overview of the RFP and resulting contract, and to answer your questions. We will have representatives of our Asset Management Office in attendance to explain the program and its goals.

 Inasmuch as our space is limited, we may need to have more than one session. In order to avoid having to turn people away, you MUST preregister for the conference. We will acknowledge your registration request, provide you with the specific location and assign you a time. Anyone who just shows up without having received an acknowledgement and time assignment should expect to be turned away.

<DESC>Description:  The contractor shall furnish all required labor, facilities, equipment, and all material to accomplish repair, test, packing, preservation and packaging and return to the Government in a completely serviceable condition at the unit price(s) established at the time of contract award, the items of Air Force equipment listed below: ANGLE OF ATTACK TRANSMITTER, NSN 6610-01-356-6949, P/N 1581C4,  APPLICABLE TO B-1B AIRCRAFT.  The period of performance is one (1) basic year with four (4) one-year options (total 5 years).  Quantities:  Basic ? 84 each, Opt I ? 84 each, Opt II ? 84 each, Opt III ? 84 each, Opt IV ? 84 each.  Dimensions: W 5.3? x H 5.0? x D 10.9?, Weight: 10.2 lbs.  Material Content: Non-corrosive metal with internal electronic components. Description and function: The Air Data Transducer has an aluminum chassis.  It consists of an electronic transducer, a differential transducer final assembly, two absolute final assemblies, a machined manifold four pneumatic ports, eight push-button drain valves, a power supply, three circuit card assemblies, a connector cable assembly, and an electronic connection.  The Transducer has a manifold that is used for moisture trapping. This manifold has a trap volume of 0.25 cubic inch minimum for each of the four pneumatic lines. There are also separate, hand-operated drain valves for each drain trap so that drainage can be accomplished in any rotation about the vertical axis. The transducer processes raw data from three pressure inputs of an air data probe and sends data digitally to the Central Air Data Computer (CADC).  The transducer contains Central Processing Unit (CPU). The CPU contains memory and performs all numerical processing, logic operations, and data transfer control functions. The CPU receives and transmits address/data information via the system address and data bus. The remaining circuit cards provide discrete signal conditioning, Analog-to-Digital (A/D) data conversion, Frequency-to-Digital (F/D) data conversion, gating and time data, and wraparound BITE data The transducer contains Built-In Test (BIT) diagnostic features that permit testing and fault defection of all transducer parameters, functional modules, and power. The Ground Readiness Test (GRT) ENABLE signal from Electrical Multiplex (EMUX) enables the Central Integrated Test System (CITS) self-test circuitry of the transducer.

<DESC>The General Services Administration's (GSA) Lease No. GS-09B-94500 expires in the near future.  The lease covers 13,599 usable square feet of office and related space in a modern, high quality office building and 24 surface parking spaces in Riverside, California.  GSA intends to negotiate an extension for 2 years firm which covers 13,599 usable square feet of office and related space and 24 surface parking spaces.

GSA is interested in considering alternate space if economically advantageous to the Government.  In determining whether relocation would be economically advantageous to the Government, GSA will consider cost factors including but not limited to the total cost of the physical move (including telecommunications and computer cabling costs); tenant improvement costs (whether included in the rent or compensated separately from the rent); and the anticipated rent for the space, as well as other factors impacting the Government's rights under a prospective lease, such as the length of any firm term that might be required at an alternate location, the length of time necessary to deliver the space ready for occupancy, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term.

Persons interested in providing space to the Government who believe they can do so at terms more favorable than those contained in a superseding lease should contact Janemarie Griffin at (949) 360-2020.

<DESC>General Services Administration (GSA) is soliciting for a construction contractor to remove and encapsulate the identified areas where PCB amended paints exist in the Juneau Federal Building, U.S. Post Office and Courthouse.  PROJECT OVERVIEW:  The Juneau Federal Building needs to maintain a safe operation and use of the facility by its tenants, users, and maintenance staff by removal or encapsulation of PCB amended paints identified to be existing at the parking garage, stairs and handrails, floors, and walls, in conformance with EPA regulations.  Removal of PCB amended paints can be accomplished using mechanical and chemical processes depending on the existing coating and substrate material.  Paint removal from concrete floors will require shot-blasting, hydro-blasting or grinding.  The base item will include the areas of basement garage and boiler room floors and basement garage walls.  Optional areas will include boiler room walls, basement offices, stairwells, mezzanine floors and walls, penthouse floors and walls, levels two through nine (electrical and phone rooms floors and walls), door frame painting, all levels.  SELECTION PROCESS: This procurement is issued pursuant to the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program.  Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a sealed bidding process.  The successful offeror will be the responsive and responsible firm offering the lowest evaluated bid price for the base bid and selected options.  The estimated magnitude of this project is between five hundred thousand dollars and one million dollars ($500,000.00 and $1,000,000.00).  The approximate duration of the contract is four months.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220.  This procurement is UNRESTRICTED.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), National Capital Region, Washington, D.C. announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in Public Architecture.  The GSA is seeking Architect-Engineering (A-E) Design Services for a major Addition and Childcare Center to the George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center (NFATC), 4000 Arlington Boulevard, Arlington, Virginia, on behalf of the U. S. Department of State (DOS) Bureau of Administration.
The Foreign Service Institute heads the NFATC complex and is the federal government's primary training institution for officers and support personnel of the U.S. foreign affairs community, preparing American diplomats and other professionals to promote U.S. foreign affairs interests overseas and in Washington, DC.  On a 72 acre campus setting, the existing 403,000 FT2 NFATC provides more than 500 training courses to more than 30,000 enrollees a year from the State Department, to more than 40 other government agencies, and to the military service branches.  The Institute's programs include training for the professional development of Foreign Service administrative, consular, economic/commercial, political, and public diplomacy officers; for specialists in the fields of information management, office management, security; for medical practitioners and nurses; for Foreign Service Nationals who work at U.S. posts around the world; and for Civil Service employees stationed in Washington, DC.  The NFATC Addition will support and accommodate a variety of administrative, instructional, multipurpose and storage spaces totaling approximately 7,238 gsm (approximately 77,905 gsf), and a detached Childcare Center of approximately 1,341 gsm (approximately 14,434 gsf), or a total of approximately 8,579 gsm (approximately 92,343 gsf).  Also required will be a Master Plan addressing facilities totaling potentially 15,141 gsm (approximately 162,980 gsf).

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) has a requirement for an all solid-state laser source at 532 nm that is suitable for optical frequency measurements and nonlinear mixing with other single frequency sources.  The single-frequency output radiation at 532 nm will be used in an optical frequency synthesis system that requires sum- and difference-frequency mixing with other spectrally pure sources (e.g. stable 657 nm diode laser radiation).  The 532 nm laser output will also be frequency-doubled to 266 nm in an external power-enhancement cavity using the nonlinear crystal BBO for use in spectroscopic investigations.*****  The output power level at 532 nm must be 10 W or greater.  The laser must operate in both a single transverse mode and a single longitudinal mode.  More specifically, the laser must deliver non-mode-hop, single-longitudinal-mode output, ie, line width must be under 5MHz.  Systems based on a multi-axial design are not acceptable.  The mode must be Gaussian (M2 less than OR EQUAL TO 1.1).  The power stability is to be no worse than plus/minus 1% over 2 hours after a 15 minute warm-up, and the amplitude noise must be less than 0.04% from 10 Hz - 1 GHz.  The output polarization is to be linear (>100:1).  The beam waist should be approximately of 2.25 mm.***** All optical elements of the laser must be permanently fixed, aligned and sealed in the optical cavity for long-term ease of use and reliability.  Adjustable optic mounts of any kind are unacceptable.  Furthermore, re-adjustment of laser optics must not be required if the pump laser is moved or repositioned.  A delivery time of less than 7 weeks ARO is required. It is the intent of the Government to award this procurement on a sole source basis under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) with Coherent Laser Group of Denver, CO.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, Propulsion Directorate/ Turbine Engine Division (AFRL/PRT) solicits research proposals for Lubrication Evaluation and Performance V. (1) This High Impact Technology (HIT) program will address both applied and fundamental research relating to critical lubricant-bearing material compatibility issues for enhanced performance and durability in support of the Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engine (VAATE) program. The DOD/DOE/NASA VAATE initiative goals include a 50°F increase in lubricant thermal capability and a 30% increase in bearing load and speed capacity, while providing improved life and reduced coking and corrosion tendency.  The objectives of this program are to: 1) assess the performance of candidate high temperature (450 to 700°F) turbine engine lubricants, and their effect on new bearing/elastomer/seal materials in order to develop optimal turbine engine lubricant(s) that will effectively support VAATE mechanical systems; 2) develop improved prognostic/diagnostic technologies for managing system health; and 3) conduct fielded mechanical lubricant system support to enhance end-product reliability/maintainability to the war fighter.   This will require a thorough understanding of the dynamic lubricant-bearing material interactions in order to positively effect high temperature lubricant formulations as well as innovative bearing materials, composites and coatings required for upcoming VAATE systems.  State-of-the-art test methodologies and techniques will be developed or modified where necessary to accommodate the unique properties of advanced high temperature lubricant basestock/additive packages as well as new bearing and elastomer composite materials.  Lubricant formulations will be evaluated with respect to tribological characteristics, oxidative and thermal stability, coking tendency, corrosion, and wear prevention.  Enhanced engine health management systems will be modified or developed to maximize the operational safety of hybrid ceramic bearings, inter-shaft counter rotating bearing systems, etc in current and future oil-wetted mechanical systems.  Fielded lubricant system support will include R&D investigations of lubrication system problems found in operating commands, as well as field evaluations of both high temperature turbine engine lubricants and prognostic/diagnostic systems to support VAATE.  (2) The Statement of Objectives for the Delivery Order involves applied and fundamental research relating to critical lubricant-bearing material compatibility.  The objective of the delivery order is to assess the performance of candidate high temperature (450 to 700oF) turbine engine lubricants and their effect on new bearing/elastomer/seal materials in order to develop optimal turbine engine lubricant (s) that will effectively support VAATE mechanical systems.  The contractor shall also develop improved prognostic/diagnostic technologies for managing system health, provide field support for fielded mechanical systems in order to enhance end-product reliability/maintainability of the war fighter.  The contractor shall characterize the performance of optimal lubricant candidates utilizing existing test methods in current turbine engine lubricant performance specifications, or modifying/developing new test methods/techniques when the need exists.  Candidate lubricant chemistries will be evaluated as fully formulated basestocks and/or individual additive components to fully assess their performance in bench scale laboratory tests.  These laboratory tests will include corrosion/oxidative stability, coking propensity, foaming, elastomer compatibility, pumpability and tribological characteristics.  The contractor shall develop a thorough understanding of the dynamic lubricant-bearing material interactions in order to positively effect high temperature lubricant formulations and innovative bearing steels/composites.  This will minimize compatibility issues for upcoming VAATE systems.  Tribological characteristics, oxidative and thermal stability, coking tendency, and corrosion and wear prevention will be evaluated to determine the effect of candidate lubricants and their individual components on state-of-the-art bearing materials and coatings.  The contractor shall evaluate enhanced engine health management systems and modify or develop new devices/techniques as required for effectively managing mechanical system health.  Health management systems shall include conventional oil-wetted systems, foil bearings and magnetic bearing systems.  This will maximize operational safety of hybrid ceramic bearings, inter-shaft counter rotating bearing systems, etc in current and future mechanical systems.  The contractor shall conduct field-testing as appropriate of prognostic/diagnostic devices in order to maximize the technology transfer of user friendly, durable and affordable devices that can be easily deployed for field use.  The contractor shall conduct R&D investigations of lubrication system problems that arise in the operating commands, as well as field evaluations of optimal turbine engine lubricant candidates, bearing/seal/elastomer materials and prognostic/diagnostic systems.  These tests will be used to determine lubricant performance, bearing material performance or material/lubricant interaction.   The contractor shall document and assess feasibility of utilizing respective lubricant(s)/bearing/seal/elastomer material(s) to support current and future fielded systems.  The contractor shall conduct laboratory and field investigations of novel lubricating systems.  Such systems include but are not limited to, vapor phase lubrication, powder lubricants, lubricious coatings, etc.  Data will be analyzed and recommendations made as to their suitability for VAATE applications.  The contractor shall be responsible for experimental design, required equipment procurement and specialized test apparatus or modifications as needed for these evaluations.  The contractor shall document and recommend the optimal lubricant for intended applications.  The contractor shall investigate the fundamental science and tribology of surfaces for propulsion systems.  The studies will include chemical reactions, kinetics, and reaction products of lubricants, lubricant additives, metals, metal oxides and other engineering material systems of interest in future propulsion engines. The contractor shall be familiar with, and able to interpret results using the following analytical techniques: scanning electron microscopy, Auger spectroscopy, x-ray photo electron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, infra-red spectroscopy, atomic emission spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and gas chromatography.

AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches and concepts to supplement and complement the existing air traffic surveillance and precision tracking systems in critical urban areas within the Continental United States (CONUS).  Primary areas of interest are to demonstrate passive surveillance systems utilizing ambient illumination sources including but not limited to FM radio, analog television, High Definition Television (HDTV) and demonstrate active sensor systems that fill existing coverage gaps.  Other areas of interest include new and innovative hardware, software and/or signal processing algorithms that yield improvements to current radar coverage around urban areas.  Concepts should explore and quantify improvements in surveillance coverage from the networking of systems including active FAA long- and short-range radars.  White papers should address the accuracy of track information (2-D and 3-D).  System concepts should be able to provide accurate surveillance and possibly even fire control tracks of targets over a wide area (e.g. 200 nautical miles radius about an urban center).  It is envisioned that the concept will be demonstrated within 18 months of contract award.   This demonstration will focus on wide area detection and track of all airborne targets including very low altitude targets.  Proposed demonstrations can be subscale but successful concepts will be required to provide a system growth plan that will demonstrate wide area coverage.  Concepts should be able to address the ambiguity and discrimination of airborne and ground-based targets.  The system concepts should support the ability of passing track data and measurement data and address the associated communications infrastructure requirements including bandwidth and latency.  Novel target identification techniques should also be explored.  Additional technology areas of interest under this BAA, include the test, measurement, analysis and modeling efforts that are required to support the development of the system concept. The primary emphasis is to identify and demonstrate promising, near term technologies for both monostatic and multistatic surveillance sensors that can be demonstrated quickly with maturity sufficient to support deployment decisions within 24 months.  In some cases, AFRL Rome may be able to provide further information.  Contact the technical POC.  The successful application of these approaches will require a broad spectrum of expertise, covering hardware, software, and systems technology.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a three (3) to five (5) page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch. Offerors must mark their submissions with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission.
All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Elaine C. Kordyban, Rome Research Site/SNRD, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514 and reference BAA-03-11-IFKA. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror.   This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 07. It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award. White papers for FY 03 should be submitted by 15 May 03.  White papers for the out years should be submitted as follows:  FY 04 should be submitted by 15 Jul 03; FY 05 – 1 May 04; FY 06 – 1 May 05; and, FY 07 – 1 May 06. White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective Fiscal Year after the dates cited.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance: (1) Openness/Maturity of Solution -- The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged, the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and the ability to demonstrate the concept within 18 months,  (2) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (3) Related Experience -- The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge and (4) Best Value --Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  Also, consideration will be given to other factors such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  All responsible organizations may submit a white paper/proposal which shall be considered.  Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions.  Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start approximately the third quarter of FY03.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging between  $100,000 to $1.2 M per year.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows:  FY 03 - $4M; FY 04 - $7M; FY 05 - $3.5M; FY 06 - $5.5M and FY 07 - $4.9M.  Total funding for this BAA is approximately $24.9 M.  Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting office focal point, Arnold J. Kloven, Contracting Officer, telephone (315) 330-4767 or e-mail Arnold.Kloven@rl.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding.  The e-mail must reference the title and BAA 03-11-IFKA.  Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Arnold Kloven, telephone (315) 330-4767 or e-mail Arnold.Kloven@rl.af.mil.  The email must reference the title and solicitation number of the acquisition.

The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors.  Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  Need to add that the sponsor of this activity utilizes contractors for technical assistance.  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  They will be used to evaluate proposals to the source selection authority.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals.  Examples of the administrative tasks performed include:  a.  Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b.  Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and 	c.  Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the contracting officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 2007.

<DESC>Air Education and Training Command (AETC) needs civilian pilots to fly Air Force T-1A aircraft on Intermediate Navigator training course sorties at Pensacola NAS. These civilian pilots must be type rated in the Beech 400 jet. These civilian pilots must either be commercial pilots type rated in the Beech 400 with an instructor pilot rating in the Beech 400, or they must be an Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) rated pilot with a type rating in the Beech 400 jet. In addition to flying local training sorties for student navigators in the Intermediate Navigator training course, ferry flights of the aircraft must be made for periodic maintenance inspections at Laughlin AFB in Del Rio, Texas. These periodic maintenance inspections are required after approximately each 200 flying hours on each airframe. Student loading in the Intermediate Navigator training course at Pensacola NAS can vary from 120 students annually to 360 students annually. If maximum student loading is experienced, an annual flight load of approximately 6,800 hours for the Intermediate Navigator training course can be expected. The pilots who fly the Intermediate Navigator training course sorties act as the pilot in command of the sortie. This entails a preflight briefing, filing of a flight plan, review of aircraft maintenance forms, preflight of the aircraft, use of all Air Force applicable checklists, obtaining a clearance, taxiing the aircraft, flying a prebriefed profile, filling out aircraft maintenance forms after the flight which could include a maintenance personnel debrief, and a crew debriefing. The contractor should plan on maintaining administrative tracking of all personnel to include tracking of currency of all pilots flying Air Force aircraft. Supervision of all airborne Air Force T-1A aircraft must also be performed by a rated pilot on the ground. This ground supervisor aids airborne crews with inflight emergencies. 

The performance period will be a basic 12 month period with 6 one year option periods.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NOTE: BID DUE DATE CHANGE TO: May 14, 2003 @ 3:30p.m.

Questions and Answers from Site Visit on April 16, 2003

1. Q.	Section 11601-2.1.6, Where is a HEPA filter required?

    A. 	HEPA filter is not required.

2. Q.	Section 11601-2.2.1, the fume hood dimensions are 48" wide, 30" deep and 96" high. On the A-4 Casework/Equipment Schedule , 60" wide, 37" deep and 85" high.  Which, if any, are correct?  Would manufacture’s standard dimensions of 48" or 60" wide, 36" deep and 89¾" high be acceptable?

A. The fume hood should be a 60-inch wide hood.  The standard 60-inch wide by 36-inch by 89¾-inch high hood is acceptable.

3. Q.	Section 11601-2.2.1.2 calls for ¾" radius intersection of interior walls w/epoxy work surface.  While this detail is very common where work surfaces are integral SS, it is highly unusual as specified. (See 4 following).

     A.	Concur, the ¾" radius for the epoxy counter tops is not required.

4. Q.	Section 11601-2.2.6.c specifies a SS cupsink.  This would appear to be further indication that perhaps a SS worktop in the fum hood was intended.  While a SS cupsink can be mounted in an epoxy worktop, it will definitely not be "integral".

     A. 	Epoxy cup sinks should be provided.

5.  Q.	Sections 1601-2.2.2.2 & 12346-2.3.1 specify epoxy resin curbs/splashes 4" high.  A-4 dimensions on elevations show 8" high.  Which is correct.

     A. 	Eight-inch high curbs/splashes are required.

6.  Q.	Section 12346-2.3 Work Surfaces (countertops) are epoxy resin.  Per 2.4.a see drawings for sink size - none are noted.

     A. 	Provide epoxy sinks consisting of either two side-by-side single-compartment types or one double-compartment types.  Minimum size for single compartment type is 15-inch side by 18 - inch front by 8 - inch depth.  Minimum size for double compartment type is 15 - inch side by 36 - inch depth. 

7.  Q.	A-4 Sinks are dotted in as double-bowl which would be typical for SS integral is SS tops.  Section 12346-2.3 specifies tops as epoxy resin.

     A.	Provide epoxy sinks (see item 6 above).

8   Q.	Sections 11601-2.3.3 & 12346-2.3.2 specify Chemical Resistant Plastic Laminate Shelving.  We find none shown.  Is this correct?

      A.	Concur, no chemical resistant plastic laminate shelving is required.

9   Q. 	There is no fume hood airflow alarm specified or detailed.  Hoods are required to have a method of airflow measurement with alarm is unsafe conditions arise.  Kewaunee Air Alert 300 should be included.

     A.	Yes, an airflow alarm is required for the fume hood.

10. Q.	Section 11601- 3.3.2 requires that the fume hood be field tested to ACGIH 2080.  The hood will be certified at the factory to perform in accordance with 2080.  Bringing in an independent out side tester to perform the test in the field, the same one performed in the factory test room, will cost the best part of $2,000.00.  Is the field test considered necessary or will the factory test certification be acceptable?

     A.	The factory test certification for fume hood is acceptable.

11. Q.	Asbestos Keynote #2 directs the removal and disposal of all gypsum board on walls and ceilings.  Does this pertain to all wall and ceilings or only those scheduled for demolition?

     A.	This keynote pertains only to ceilings and walls that will be "disturbed".

12.  Q.	There are not symbols for water lines.

     A.	The identification of the different water piping symbols is given on sheet M-2 at the bottom right corner of the floor plan (in Equipment Room area).

13.  Q.	Is the sanitary piping to be cast iron?

     A.	The sanitary piping can be the PVC piping called for in the specifications.

14.  Q.	Are the water lines to be routed through the ceiling or under the concrete?

The water lines are to run through the attic and are to be insulated.

15.  Q.	Can the laboratory casework be wood casework?
								
     A.	The laboratory casework to be provide shall be steels as specified.

16.  Q.	The vent hood shown on M-3 by note 5 in room 100 has a 12" exhaust pipe.  This conflicts with the wall cabinet shown above the hood on elevation 4/A4.

     A.	Concur, the wall cabinet shown above the vent hood need to be deleted from the project.

17.  Q.	Is the plumbing shown to be above the ceiling or under the floor?  There is no insulation above the ceiling joists to protect any plumbing in the attic area.

     A.	The water lines need to be routed above the ceiling and need to be insulated

18.  Q.	The R-11 insulation specified to be above the ceiling is only 3 ½" thick and not 6" as is usual for a ceiling.

     A.	The R-value of the ceiling insulation (paragraph 2.1 of Specification Section 07232) should read R-19 in lieu of the R-11 indicated.

19.  Q.	Why not use metal studs on the outside block walls with plumbing being added.  Otherwise the plumbing will have to be cut into the block or run in a gap in the insulation.  Either way there is no insulation protecting the pipes.  This also would make it much easier to get the 2" vent pipe on the roof.  On the walls with no plumbing, using z channels instead of the hat channels will eliminate the large gaps in the insulation due to the width of the hat channels.

     A.	The water lines will need to be insulated.  Deeper metal framing section can be used to conceal the plumbing behind the finished wall surfaces, but will have to be consistent across the full width of the wall (no pilaster type areas for the plumbing).  The plumbing wall in Toilet 103 can not be made deeper because of ADA space requirements.

20.  Q.	There is an emergency eye wash/shower to be installed but the plans do not call for a floor drain.  Is a floor drain required?

    A.	A floor drain is not required.

<DESC>Closing date for revised proposals will remain 5 May 03.  The following questions and government response to those questions are hereby provided.

Question 1: Is it acceptable for vendors to just provide changes and clarifications to their original proposals as opposed to providing completely new proposals?  

Answer 1: All vendors have been provided an opportunity to update their proposal as a result of the changes posted in Amendment 4 of the RFP, and the discussion process.  As a result, all vendors should acknowledge their acceptance of Amendment 4 when either submitting a revised proposal or change pages to their original current proposal.  The Government requests that if possible, change pages vice a complete proposal be submitted.  In either case, as stated in the Feedback document emailed to vendors on 25 April 2003, the vendor must provide DISA with a change matrix that states which MOM scores, MOM addenda, and other aspects of their proposal have changed since their previous proposal submission.  Specific numbers of changed MOMs and their addenda must be provided.  Due to the time constraints incumbent upon the DISA evaluators, the evaluators will only evaluate those changed portions of the proposal that are mentioned in the change matrix.  


Question 2: Please clarify what components are included in the footprint space calculation.

Answer 2: As stated in the Footprint Scoring Scheme document, "The footprint scores are based on the amount of vertical space in a standard 19-inch rack that is consumed by the vendor’s proposed equipment that will be installed at one analysis facility during Phase 3.  In cases where the amount of space consumed by equipment at different analysis facilities differs, then the space consumed at the facility where the most space is consumed will be used as a basis for the footprint score.  The space consumed by the analysis consoles at the analysis facilities is not included in the footprint computations."  This means that the analysis consoles, i.e., the desktop computers and monitors with which the human analysts interact to view and respond to security events, are not included in the footprint computations.  All other components are included in the footprint computations.  

Question 3. The vendor also asks whether simply listing the hardware in their cost proposal is an adequate response to our request for footprint data.  

Answer 3.  It is not.  Section 3.3 of the vendor feedback document specifically states what they need to provide.  This is stated in Q&A format below.  

Question 4: What footprint data must vendors provide to DISA?

Answer 4: As stated in the Feedback document emailed to vendors on 25 April 2003, "The proposal must include a Phase 3 system architectural diagram that illustrates the types, numbers, and sizes of computer equipment that is proposed for installation at each of DISA's facilities.  In addition, the vendors must provide DISA the data necessary for DISA to compute the physical footprint score of your proposal using the new scoring system.  The footprint score will be based on the amount of vertical space (measured in U) in a standard 19-inch rack that is consumed by the vendor's proposed equipment that will be installed at one analysis facility during Phase 3.  In cases where the amount of space consumed by equipment at different analysis facilities differs, then the space consumed at the facility where the most space is consumed will be used as a basis for the footprint score.  The space consumed by the analysis consoles at the analysis facilities is not included in the footprint computations.  Vendors must provide DISA with specifics on rack space consumed at every location where equipment will be installed.  For example, a particular vendor might state that their solution requires 4U of rack space at each location.  This information must be consistent with the diagrams and product literature provided by vendor.   In the event that a vendor does not provide sufficient information in their proposal to determine their implementation's footprint score, then that vendor's footprint score shall be zero (the lowest score)."

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to provide an update on the DHS SPIRIT (formerly CGITSS) project and to post answers to questions received as a result of Industry Days held in December 2002.  We anticipate the following revised procurement leadtime: RFP release end of Third Qtr FY03; proposals due end of Fourth Qtr FY03; contracts awarded in First Qtr FY04.  No draft RFP or pre-proposal conference is planned.  Since the last notice regarding this project was posted, there have been three major changes to the project information previously presented.  These changes are as follows: (1) SPIRIT contracts will now be 10 years in length; (2) the estimated overall project is valued at $10 Billion over the 10 year period; and (3) the labor category scenario presented in our original draft requirements document has been modified as a result of recommendations received during Industry Day sessions.  Rather than requiring contractors to propose on a long list of labor categories for each functional area as was originally anticipated, contractors will be required to propose on government identified core labor categories for each functional area in which they are competing.  Contractors may also propose the additional labor categories they deem necessary to provide the full gamut of service support in the functional area(s) in which they are competing.  A list or the core labor categories for each functional area will be posted on this website by the end of May 2003.  We would also like to point out that the Department of Homeland Security follows the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  As such, the SPIRIT contracts will be awarded in accordance with FAR.  CONTRACTORS NOTE:  DUE TO THE OVERWHELMING INTEREST IN THIS REQUIREMENT, NO QUESTIONS OR ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS REGARDING THE DHS SPIRIT PROJECT ARE BEING ACCEPTED.  E-MAILS OR TELEPHONIC INQUIRIES RECEIVED WILL NOT BE ADDESSED.  All further DHS SPIRIT project information, including the RFP, will be posted on this site as it becomes available.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to address questions from potential offerors. Question 1. For options, the solicitation specifies "one each additional spare clamp with sputter guard for 3, 4, and 6 inch wafers". Are you requesting an electrostatic clamp?  Please clarify. Answer to Question 1. The system must be able to etch 3, 4, and 6 inch samples without having to go through more than 10 minutes of tool configuring. An electrostatic chuck is acceptable if it allows changing sample sizes with ease of operation. Question 2. The specification does not state if you desire the system to be loadlocked or not. If you are planning on using corrosive chemistries (C12, BC13, HBr, etc) then it will need a loadlock and a gas cabinet with automatic purging. Can you specify the gases that are to be used in this system?  Answer to Question 2. See Sections 1.00, 2.13, 3.01, and 3.02 of the Specifications.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 235910   This Amendment No. 1 to combined synopsis/solicitation RFQ-OH-03-00062 provides answers to questions received in response to the RFQ and amends the RFQ as follows: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in  Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This request for quotation number RFQ-OH-03-00062 and incorporated provisions and  clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13.  This is a total small business set-aside; NAICS code 235910.  The size standard is $11.5 million.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement for well drilling services at Loring Air Force Base in Linestone  Maine.  Statement of Work:  The contractor shall obtain eight (8) rock cores from the area where the steam injection demonstration was carried out at the former Loring Air Force Base Quarry site in Limestone, Maine.  From each of these rock cores, the contractor shall select fractures and areas of  the rock matrix to be sampled for volatile organic compounds using an extraction method that is a modification to EPA Method 5035 (see below).  The contractor shall obtain the rock cores, the rock chip samples, perform the extraction as per the following SOP, and prepare the samples for shipment.   The services do not include logging of the rock core, shipment of samples, nor analysis of the samples.  Specific tasks are:  (1)  Drill, eight (8) cored boreholes, each approximately 100 ft. in depth using diamond core NQ-3 or NQ double tube wireline drilling techniques.  The boreholes will be  drilled in an area of approximately 100 ft. by 100 ft.  The area is accessible by a truck mounted drilling rig and a pressurized water supply (fire hydrant) is located approximately 500 ft. away.  There is no overburden at the site.  Boreholes shall be cased in the upper 10 feet only.  The  contractor shall decontaminate the drilling equipment between boreholes.  The contractor shall discharge decontaminated water to the ground surface.  The CONTRACTOR shall provide boxes for the cores; (2)  Obtain approximately 100 rock chip samples from fracture surfaces or of the matrix that meet  the following [Rock Chip Sample Extraction Procedure:  A modification of EPA Method 5035 will be used to extract the bedrock samples collected in the field.  Method 5035 lists different procedures for processing samples that are expected to contain low concentrations (0.5 to 200  g/kg) or high  concentrations (>200  g/kg) of VOCs.  Procedures for high levels of VOCs will be used in the field because those procedures will facilitate the processing of large volume sample cores collected during bedrock sampling. The procedure previously used during the Phase I site characterization study  and to be used here is based on collecting approximately 50 to 80 grams (g) of rock chips in a pre-weighed eight ounce (oz) wide mouth glass jar.  Approximately 100 mL of methanol will then be added to the glass jar.  The rock chips will be of a size and shape that will allow them to be completely  immersed in the methanol.  The following is the procedure that will be used in the field: 	*The 50 to 80 g of rock chips will be placed in a pre-weighed 8 oz. wide mouth glass jar.  Approximately 100 mL of reagent grade methanol will then be added to the glass jar.  After capping, the glass jar  will be weighed again with a top-loading balance (to nearest 0.01 gram) and marked with the location ID, sample interval, and date and time the sample was collected. 	*The glass jar filled with methanol and rock chips will then be stored at 4  C for seven days while the extraction takes  place. 	*Methanol extract will then be decanted into a 20-mL glass volatile organic analysis (VOA) vial and a 40-mL glass VOA vial (to be archived) using a 10-mL disposable pipette.  The 20-mL glass VOA vials containing the extract will be capped, labeled, and stored at 4  C until they are shipped  in a cooler with ice to the laboratory.  The 40-mL VOA vials will be stored in a refrigerator and archived on site until the analytical data has been approved by EPA.]  The Project Officer will provide the sampling bottles, jars, methanol, and all other equipment needed for the sample extraction;  however, the contractor shall acquire the samples and perform the extractions per the aforementioned procedure.       (3)  Package the methanol samples in plastic coolers packed with ice suitable for shipment to the U.S. EPA. .  Each cooler shall include a chain of custody; (4) The U.S. EPA  Project Officer will be at the site at the time of the drilling/sampling to receive the samples from the contractor and to provide consultation as to the exact location of the holes to be drilled and the cores to be sampled; (5) The contractor shall complete the drilling and sampling within 30 days  of purchase order award (approximately May 30, 2003).  The following provisions apply:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors?Commercial Items; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions?Commercial Items; 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive  Orders?Commercial Items.  Quotes shall include a completed copy of 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications?Commercial Items.  Quotes shall include the following past performance information:  three (3) references for which similar services have been provided; the name and telephone  number of a contact person for each reference; contract number, description and dollar value of the services.  Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror with an acceptable record of past per formance.  The full text of the clauses referenced above can be found at:  www. arnet.gov/far.   Questions should be sent via email to Sandy Savage at savage.sandra@epa.gov.  The due date for quotes is May 5, 2003 at 3:00 p.m. EDT.

RFQ03-02457

Statement of Work for Graphic Design Contract

I.	INTRODUCTION

Background
During the past four years the Congressional Research Service (CRS) has unveiled a new logo and has been working on the redesign of all materials that use the logo.  It has been a multi-stage process: working with design students and learning about fonts, design elements and themes; testing designs with our clients; working with a professional designer to refine a logo, and redesigning our products. This program, called CRS Visual Identity, is being administered by the Associate Director for Congressional Affairs and Counselor to the Director of the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress.

Our purpose has been to achieve a unified design look that is engaging, and elegant.  Prior to these design changes, the design of our numerous materials was so varied that our clients were unable to quickly and easily identify our products or services. Congressional staff have a high turn over rate compared to other industries, so it is important to quickly build a visual awareness or branding.  In addition, our clients receive vast amounts of information daily and our products need designs that are both engaging and easily recognizable as a CRS product.

Scope
The Congressional Research Service desires to create a Blanket Purchase Agreement for the design of several CRS products on a continuing basis. These products range in length and number. As the public policy arm of Congress, CRS works exclusively and directly  for all Members and committees of the Congress.  For this reason it is important that all products published by CRS be uniform and distinct in design whether a CRS short or long report cover,   an issue brief, seminar or recruiting  materials, an invitation, bags,  or materials for the several institutes and briefings held for Members of Congress during the year. 

	The objective of this requirement is to create or update materials using the existing CRS logo design and previously developed design themes and standards, so that they have a consistent look with existing materials and are engaging to congressional, CRS and public audiences.

<SOLNBR>RFQ042898
<RESPDATE>050803

<DESC>AMENDMENT #0002 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS: Question: Does the FBI expect that hours that have already been used to meet the requirements for the master's degree would also count toward 72 
hours of the post-master's program? Or do participants need to complete a minimum of 72 hours of post-master's work, i.e., hours beyond the master's and not counted toward the master's degree? Answer: The FBI envisions that 36 hours of master's level work links up with 36 new, post-masters level course work, for a total of 72 hours of course work. We are not expecting to "double count" the 36 hours at the master's level, rather, that work is spread across areas of concentration and we want a program that will build upon those 36 hours and add to courses across areas of concentration.  Our purpose in designing this program is so that the work done at the master's level lays the foundation for the 
additional post-masters work.  In addition to the 36 new hours of course work, additional "dissertation credits" are envisioned to allow the students to work on research projects that are of a priority at the Academy and meet the institution's research/dissertation requirement and will allow for the students, upon completion, to be eligible for a degree. We've tried to allow flexibility in the number of hours, recognizing this varies from institution to institution. Question: Are we correct that "cognate" and "elective" can be used interchangeably? Answer: These terms are inter-changeable. Question: Is the total required in the cognate-elective area 12 hours of which six may be from prior graduate work? Answer: Yes, at least 6 new hours. Question: Already included in the FBI post-grad development program: Informal Learning in the Workplace;
Adult Learning. (If these were counted toward a master's degree they cannot count as additional hours toward the doctorate.) Answer: Understood they don't "count" but they represent areas where the learners already have completed study, and may stand as prerequisites for additional course work. In foundations, at least 3 new hours is required, and the FBI is suggesting four types of courses that could be considered as foundations. If a 
responding institution has additional courses in the foundation area other than the four listed, those courses could be substituted for one of the four suggested. Question: Already included in the FBI post-grad development program: Instructional Systems Design (If this was counted toward a master's degree it cannot count as additional hours toward the doctorate.) Answer:
Understood they don't "count" but ISD represents an area of study already completed, and the required 6 new hours of study should interlock with the course already completed by the learners.  6 new hours of post-masters work is envisioned in this area. Question: Already included in the FBI post-grad development program: Educational Research (If this was counted toward a 
master's degree it cannot count as additional hours toward the doctorate.) Answer: Again, understood that Educational Research doesn't count, but the 12 new hours of study should inter-relate or build upon this completed course. 17.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quote (RFQ) number 042898.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-12.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is 611430.  The Business Size Standard for this solicitation is $5 million.   The term of this contract shall be for one year from date of award.  The Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has a requirement for a firm fixed-price contract for one year with four (4), one-year options for the acquisition of the following services:  Accredited university post-masters program in education, adult learning or human resource development, interdisciplinary studies and other academic disciplines which provide and support an array of relevant course offerings which relate to the mission, responsibilities, requirements and needs of the FBI;  Academic programs which are flexible enough to provide a strong formal education structure, but can accommodate an orientation toward the adult learner;  Course offerings and consultative services within or between university departments than can lead to a terminal degree, should the individual student participant so desire;  A measurable percentage of relevant course work which is taught either at the beginning or end (evenings) of the workday.  Additionally, it would be desirable for respondents to offer a maximum degree of flexibility in course scheduling.  Distance learning methods can be used to supplement instruction within a course.  University submitting a proposal must have a permanent teaching facilities located within fifty miles of Washington, D.C., or be willing to conduct classes at the FBI Academy, and possibly establish a presence at the FBI Academy. The FBI will provide all necessary classroom facilities and Audio Visual (AV) equipment for classes conducted at the FBI Academy.  Partnerships or consortium arrangements among universities are strongly encouraged. Appointment of appropriately credentialed FBI personnel as Adjunct faculty, for the purpose of course planning and execution, research and development or participation in other university programs.  Where appropriate, courses could be developed and conducted jointly to take advantage of both university and FBI expertise and facilities.  All students should be charged the same rate of tuition regardless of the state or district where they reside.  Collaboration by university and FBI personnel to develop "short" (compressed time) courses, specialized training and conferences which address emerging or as yet un-addressed requirements and needs of the national and international law enforcement training and education community. Active participation by university faculty and post-graduate students in collaborative basic and applied research with the FBI. When research is assigned or agreed to by a faculty member and/or post-graduate student, FBI staff will participate actively in that program for its duration, to include membership on the student research committee. The collaboration could include regular on-site visits (both university and FBI Academy) to work on research projects.  It should be the intention of both parties to encourage joint presentation/publication of research or other work in relevant, peer-reviewed journals or forums.  Willingness of the universities to meet all of the above to engineer and maintain strategic partnerships to achieve a multi-layered program. In your response to this Request for Proposals, the offeror shall also submit to the FBI the following information:  Course descriptions, titles and numbers contained in the university/college catalog;  Requirements for the relevant degree program, including prerequisite and graduation requirements; and, Policy regarding acceptance of course credits from other universities. The guaranteed minimum under this contract will be one class of eight students.  Description and program specifics:  The FBI seeks a sequence of courses and milestones that can be identified as a block of courses, to include preliminary exams and timetable for coordinating published research.  Standard admissions process - proposal must include admission process requirements.  The FBI anticipates the course work will center on these four areas:  Foundations - A minimum of three courses in foundations, including topics such as Informal Learning in the Workplace, The Programming Process in Adult Learning, History of Adult Education, Individual and Organizational Development, Philosophical Foundations of Human Resource Development, and Adult Learning.  FBI students participating in the post-graduate development program already have Informal Learning in the Workplace and The Adult Learner (syllabi for these two courses are available upon request).  These additional courses build on the instruction already provided in the area of adult learning.  Having a professional competence in the area of adult learning is critical both to the mission of the FBI and to the design and delivery of curriculum consistent with the latest advances in the educational community.  Generally, the area of foundations addresses the broader historical, philosophical and theoretical underpinnings of adult education and human resource development.  Practice - A minimum of three courses in practice, including topics such as Consulting With Human Systems, Small Groups in Adult Learning, Facilitating Adult Learning, and Instructional Systems Design.    FBI students participating in the post-graduate development program already have Instructional Systems Design (syllabus for this course is available upon request).  These two additional courses reinforce the provided instruction and further develop the professional instructor competence in small group learning in adults and in human systems.  Generally, the area of practice addresses applications of models and theoretical perspectives of engagement of individuals and other human systems.  Research - A minimum of fifteen (15) hours of statistics and research methods courses are required.  These courses address topics including but not limited to:  qualitative methods and quantitative methods (advanced statistics/regression and program evaluation research methods).    FBI students participating in the post-graduate development program already have one course in Educational Research (syllabus for this course is available upon request).  These research and statistics courses are extremely important to develop a professional research component at the Academy in the short-term, and the University in the long-term.  The research capacity must be developed in a manner that conforms with academic standards, so that results are published, defended and accepted within the academic community.   Generally, the area of research addresses research methods, qualitative and quantitative, including statistical concepts and other tools of inquiry.  In addition to the formal course work in the area of research, the FBI requires its post-graduate students to collaborate on projects demonstrating basic and applied research in addressing critical issues within the FBI.   The research will focus on problems identified and research supported, at least in part, by the FBI.  It is the FBI's intention to encourage an inter-locking research agenda, so that post-graduate students participate joint presentation/publication of research or other work in relevant, peer-reviewed journals or forums.  The FBI estimates this coordinated research effort, which meets the academic equivalent of a published dissertation, to take approximately 30 hours of credit course work, supervised by a faculty committee.  Topics for this coordinated research agenda would be approved by the Assistant Director, Training Division, and by the supervising faculty committee.  Cognate - A minimum of three courses in a "cognate." The FBI desires to assemble some of the course work for this cognate from other courses participating students completed during graduate level course work.  Generally, the area of a cognate represents an area of specialization representing course work relating to a specific academic discipline or specific practice area.  Cognate areas which directly relate to the mission of the FBI include:  distance learning, human development, management science, organizational behavior, curriculum and instruction, knowledge management, and educational administration.  Other cognate areas may be added to this long-term development plan by the FBI, based on the needs of the FBI.  In the event a responding institution has a cognate area that is believed to relate directly to the mission of the FBI and adult learning, respondents are requested to identify the area and the courses which comprise the cognate.  Some of these courses are referred to as "electives," for a total of 12 hours, six of which must be completed in the post-graduate work.  Six of the hours can be carried over from course work completed by the students during graduate level study.  Again, the courses in the electives phase will relate directly to the mission of the FBI and adult learning or organizational development issues.  Professional competence in these areas is essential to fulfill the mission of the FBI and to realize the full potential of the new University.  When matters of research or study contain sensitive information the FBI Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) will be required to approve release of this information.  It is proposed that students will start, and finish, at the same time.  Students will carry either 9 or 6 credits each semester.  The course of study may extend from the base year through options years.  The COTR will work with the selected vendor to identify the courses and their sequence. Participation in this program will be allowed to other Federal Government Agencies authorized by the FBI.  All quotes shall be submitted to the address listed below no later than 3:00 PM, EST, May 8, 2003.  Quotes shall be clearly marked RFQ 042898.  No hand-carried or faxed packages will be considered.

<DESC>NASA/JSC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources to develop gravity-independent Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) power plant technology as a source of primary power for the Orbital Space Plane (OSP).  The period of performance for the contract would be 15 months.  The goal of this program is to advance the PEMFC power plant to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 (engineering model tested in relevant environment).  The contract will culminate in the fabrication and performance testing of the engineering model power plant at the vendor and environmental testing at a NASA facility. The PEMFC power plant engineering model to be procured shall consist of one or more fuel cell stacks integrated with the various balance-of-plant components required for spacecraft applications, including active cooling system, single cell voltage monitoring, gravity-independent water separation, and reactant conditioning and recirculation devices that support safe operation with pure oxygen and hydrogen streams.  The power plant shall provide at least 7 kW of power between 27.5 and 32.5 V and have operating life of over 10,000 hours.	However, this technology shall be scalable to achieve different power levels (3 to 70 kW) and/or a higher voltage level (up to 270 V).  Presently, fuel cell stack hardware is judged to be at a higher level of technology readiness than some of the ancillary components required for space applications.  Therefore, the focus of this program is balance-of-plant component development and power plant hardware integration.  To achieve a  (TRL) of 6 within the schedule, appropriate offerors are anticipated to be fuel cell stack vendors as well as experienced space hardware integrators.  A number of value characteristics will be included in the Request for Offer (RFO).  These include, but are not limited to, items such as enhanced safety, improved reliability, innovativeness of ideas, ability to accommodate stacks from multiple vendors, and past power plant integration experience. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement of 10 pages or less indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein.  Responses also must include a schedule, based on a 15 month period of performance, cost estimates based on the TRL and requirements discussed above, and a capability statement including demonstration of ability and qualifications (market/application of existing PEMFC product or component). Other information that must be submitted is as follows:  name and address of firm, size of business; number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).  Technical questions should be directed to:  Karla Bradley, 281.483.6019, e-mail:  karla.f.bradley@nasa.gov Procurement related questions should be directed to: Michele H. Ladrach, telephone 281-483-6096, email michele.h.ladrach@nasa.gov This requirement is not considered to be commercial or commercial-type product. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.	All responses shall be submitted to Michele H. Ladrach no later than May 21, 2003.  Please reference 9-BH13-26-03-19P in any response.

<DESC>The National Toxicology Program (NTP) is seeking research and development sources capable of conducting toxicology and carcinogenicity studies for the National Toxicology Program of radio frequency radiation (RFR) in rats and mice. In these studies, unrestrained and individually caged animals shall be exposed to modulated RFR signals in reverberation chambers. In addition to the specialized expertise and facility needed to properly set up and monitor RF electromagnetic fields in reverberation chambers, additional expertise, facilities and equipment will be needed to evaluate a variety of toxicologic endpoints in large groups of experimental animals. Because of the extensive use of wireless communication devices and because RFR exposure guidelines are based on protection from acute injury from thermal effects, there is an urgent need for long-term exposure studies on RFR for the evaluation of potential human health effects. Consequently, these studies shall be initiated and completed in a timely fashion.

	SCOPE OF WORK
	
 
A reverberation chamber is a shielded room having an excitation antennae and ventilation panels. In addition, a rotating paddle creates a statistically homogeneous electromagnetic environment. Because the NTP studies may require up to 300 animals individually caged (in plastic cages on plastic cage racks) in each chamber and because of needs for spatial separation of animal cages from each other and from conducting surfaces during exposures, the dimensions of each reverberation chamber will be approximately 6.7 meters (L) x 5.2 meters (W) x 4.2 meters (H). Further, these studies may require 4 power levels plus a sham at 2 separate frequencies; thus, the facility must be able to house 9-10 reverberation chambers of the dimensions indicated above. Animals shall remain individually caged in the reverberation chambers during the nonexposure periods. The Government will provide the reverberation chambers, signal generators, amplifiers, antennas, digital and analog wave synthesizers, isotropic field probes, stirring paddles, ventilation panels, computers for control of the internal environment and data acquisition, and software and user manuals for collection of data into the Toxicology Data Management System. The organization submitting capability statements must have sufficient laboratory space to accommodate the reverberation chambers and capability of setting up the chambers with proper environmental and lighting conditions as well as of monitoring the uniformity of the internal electromagnetic fields. Engineers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology have worked with the NTP to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. They will be available for consultation in the set up and monitoring of the chamber environments and to calibrate the field probes. 

It is anticipated that preliminary studies of 2-7 weeks duration plus lifetime studies in rats and mice shall be conducted at two separate frequencies (one in the range of 900 MHz and the other at approximately 1900 MHz). Measurements of animal whole body temperature at the end of a daily exposure shall be taken at various intervals of these studies. Because large differences in dosimetry can occur when animals of different sizes are exposed together in the same chamber, separate exposures shall be needed for studies in rats and mice. The lifetime studies (exposure until survival in sham groups reaches 20%) shall include interim sacrifices at one or two time points. The preliminary studies and/or the interim sacrifices shall include the following evaluations: histopathology including special staining techniques such as for brain albumin leakage, hematology, clinical chemistry including measurements of serum melatonin and other hormone levels, metabonomic urinalysis, sperm morphology and vaginal cytology, micronuclei, and neurotoxicity. Because these studies may include gestational exposures, information must be included on rat and mouse breeding capabilities at the facility.   

All studies shall be performed in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practice Regulations established by the FDA for Non-clinical Laboratory Studies (FDA Good Laboratory Practice Regulations for Non-clinical Laboratory Studies; Final Report (Fed. Register, Vol 52, # 172, Friday September 4, 1987, pp 33768-33782; 21 CFR Part 58) and the "Specifications for the Conduct of Studies to Evaluate the Toxic and Carcinogenic Potential of Chemical, Biological and Physical Agents in Laboratory Animals for the National Toxicology Program (NTP)" dated September 2000, "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, NRC, 1996," and "Laboratory Animal Welfare Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-544) as amended in 1970, 1976, and 1985."  In addition, the facility must be AALAC (Association and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care) accredited and have a functional Animal Care and Use Committee.  An NTP contractor will provide serology testing as part of an infectious disease surveillance program. 



REQUIRED CAPABILITIES

 
Organizations submitting capability statements must have a working laboratory in place capable of performing the types of studies indicated above. A Principal Investigator, Electrical Engineer, Toxicologist, Pathologist, Laboratory Animal Veterinarian, Health and Safety Officer, and Quality Assurance Unit Officer are disciplines necessary. The daily interaction and constant coordination of efforts needed among these discipline
	areas throughout the in-life portion of the studies makes it critical that they be physically and organizationally together.  Specifically, requirements include: 1) principal investigator who is experienced in conducting toxicologic studies and in the management and coordination of multidisciplinary projects, 2) electrical engineer and technicians who can set up reverberation chambers for RFR exposures and monitor the uniformity of the internal electromagnetic fields, 3) pathologist, prosectors, histology technicians who are experienced in rodent studies, 4) veterinarian and animal care technicians who are experienced in studies in rats and mice with ability to collect blood for clinical pathology determinations including serum hormone measurements, prepare blood smears for micronucleus determinations, collect urine for metabonomic urinalysis, and perform necropsies for reproductive system effects (vaginal cytology, sperm motility and counts), and 5) adequate facilities and equipment for lab animal management and to perform RFR studies and routine histopathology. The facility must have capabilities for cleaning cage racks, cages, water bottles, and feeders. 

The breadth of measures in these studies may require subcontracting some of the work. Organizations shall have the necessary facilities, personnel, equipment, and capability in-house or through subcontract to perform the following evaluations:

General Toxicology. The ability to perform specific toxicologic evaluations such as clinical pathology determinations including serum hormone levels, micronucleus determinations, metabonomic urinalysis, and reproductive system effects (vaginal cytology, sperm motility and counts).

<SUBJECT>23 -- MV-22 Internally Transportable Tactical Vehicle Transportability Seminar and Loading Exercise
<DESC>The Marine Corps System Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting a V-22 Transportability Seminar and Loading Exercise the week of 9-13 June 2003 at Naval Air Station (NAS), Patuxent River, Maryland.  MARCORSYSCOM is seeking information from any commercial source capable of providing a high mobility utility/weapons platform that is deployable inside the V-22 aircraft. The vehicle must operate on diesel fuel, be able to carry the M-2 .50 cal,  the MK-19 40 mm, or the M240G medium machine gun, and be internally transportable in MV-22 aircraft. Vendors able to meet this requirement are invited to attend a V-22 Transportability Seminar and Loading Exercise.  No deliverables are required in response to this announcement.  The purpose of this announcement is to allow commercial firms with vehicles that are likely to fit inside the V-22 to interact with the Government in order to better understand the complexities of the requirement for internal transport.  Vendors attending the V-22 Transportability Seminar will be given a presentation on the requirements for internal transport within a V-22.  Vendors responding to this announcement will also be offered access to a V-22 mock-up at NAS Patuxent River.  Vendors may bring one vehicle to load into the V-22 mock-up and will receive feedback from Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Engineers on the “goodness of fit” of their representative vehicle.  Vendors who do not wish to bring a vehicle to the seminar may still have access to the mock-up and will receive feedback from NAVAIR Engineers on any paper designs or drawings they wish to show.The schedule of events for the V-22 Transportability Seminar and Loading Exercise will be dependent upon the number of interested responders to this announcement.  It is planned that all vendors will attend a one hour lecture on ITTV/V-22 Interface Requirements.  Following this presentation, vendors will be invited to submit questions in writing.  Any questions that are not answered at that time, as well as those that have been answered, will be posted to the MARCORSYSCOM ITTV Website upon establishment at a future date. Additionally, each vendor will be allotted time in the V-22 mock-up ranging between 1 and 2 hours with the final duration to be determined at a later date.
The established dimensions for vehicles loading inside the V-22 are as follows (further details and guidance will be provided at the Seminar):
·	Total system LENGTH, to include tie-down structures, must not exceed 200 inches
·	Maximum allowable WIDTH, with 2,000 lbs payload, must not exceed 60 inches
·	Maximum allowable HEIGHT, in transport mode, must not exceed 60.2 inches
·	Maximum allowable WEIGHT, including payload and one driver, must not exceed 17 pounds per square inch (psi) per tire contact point and 2,450 lbs per axle (threshold), 1800 lbs per axle (objective).
·	WHEEL BASE must be greater than 48 inches and WHEEL TRACK must be greater than 36 inches.
For the purposes of this Loading Exercise, vehicles do not have to meet the dimensional criteria listed above.  Ultimately, an ITTV will have to fall within this criterion, but any firms with vehicles now that may eventually be modified to fit the box as outlined above may bring those vehicles to the mock-up for the Loading Exercise in June 2003.
This announcement is a follow-up to an Request for Information (RFI) for an Internally Transportable Tactical Vehicle (ITTV) released in October 2002.  For convenience, this announcement may be found at the following: 
http://www.eps.gov/servlet/Documents/R/479075.
Vendors interested in attending the V-22 Transportability Seminar and Loading Exercise must submit a Statement Of Interest to the Government no later than 15 May 2003. Statements Of Interest should be submitted to Mr. Pete Ostrom via email in accordance with the following guidance:
1.	Emails must be sent to Pete Ostrom at ostrompl@mcsc.usmc.mil. 
2.	Email must be received no later than 4 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on May 15, 2003 in order to allow the Government time to arrange final scheduling for the Seminar and Loading Exercise.
3.	Email must include the following in the Subject line:  ITTV SEMINAR REQUEST FOR (PROVIDE COMPANY NAME HERE)
4.	Email must indicate whether the interested firm will bring a vehicle for the Loading Exercise or whether the firm would like a paper concept review.
5.	Email must provide phone, email, and fax contact info for interested firms.
6.	Responding firms may request a specific day during the week of 9 June for their Loading Exercise. The Government will make a reasonable attempt to accommodate such scheduling requests.
7.	The Seminar schedule will be set after the response date closes on May 15.  Multiple Seminars will be scheduled as needed to prevent firms from having a significant time gap between a Seminar and their scheduled Loading Exercise.
8.	No facsimiles shall be accepted.

<DESC>CBD COMBINED/SYNOPSIS SOLICTATION

(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source – Hispanic Association of Colleges and University (HACU) under authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement (see xvi).  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  See numbered Note 22 for further specifics.

(ii) This Solicitation MDA94603T0047 is a Request for Quote (RFQ) for Summer Interns. 

(iii) This Solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-13, effective March 18, 2003.

(iv) The applicable North American Industry Classification System code is 813410 and the corresponding size standard is $5.0 million.  The Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program does not cover this procurement.

Clin 0001:  Provide six (6) Hispanic Interns for employment at the Department of Defense (DOD) during Summer 2003 (June 4, 2003 through August 10, 2003).  

(v) & (vi) Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities Internship Program General Requirement:  The Secretary of Defense has committed the Department to increase representation of persons of Hispanic background within the overall DoD work force.  A key method of accomplishing this requirement is to better inform current college/university students of employment possibilities with DoD upon graduation through temporary internships of such students in DoD facilities during summer break.  How Requirement Developed:  In the Spring of 1998, the acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management Policy committed the DoD to participate to a much higher degree in programs to enhance the visibility of DoD within the Hispanic community.  The use of the internship program provided by the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) was an immediately available vehicle to quickly bring into the DoD workplace a number of highly qualified individuals.  DoD contracted with HACU to obtain the services of interns, who remained as employees of HACU, a more expeditious method than recruitment of persons who would have become temporary Federal employees during the summer period.  Overall Program Objectives:  The primary goal is to continue to increase the visibility of DoD within the Hispanic community, in order to enhance employment opportunities for a wide range of persons.  The expectation is that the interns who work within DoD offices will either themselves apply for permanent positions within DoD upon graduation, or at the very least communicate a favorable impression of DoD as an employer to fellow students, family members, and friends.  Specific Objectives:  Participating interns are provided employment placement to the maximum extent possible into offices closely matching their areas of interest and expertise.  This will serve the two-fold purpose of ensuring that they are able to use their skills in meaningful employment opportunities, and that the offices to which they are assigned achieve maximum benefit of their skills and knowledge in specific functional areas of science, management, financial operations, technology, program planning, or other fields of study.  Supplier Requirements:  HACU will provide the following services:  recruitment of participants; employment (receiving and processing applications, matching assignments); orientation in Washington, DC prior to entry on duty; developmental activities; assisting interns in obtaining academic credit for program participation; support services such as program handbooks and updates, communication; housing assistance; travel expenses to DC area and program evaluation.  Direction on specific methodologies to be used:  Merit principles and careful matching of candidate to employment opportunities.  Applicability of Specification and Standards:  Interns will be fully qualified in specific skills set forth by offices in which employed, and will meet any security requirements.  Period of Performance:  The period of performance for this period is for one fiscal year beginning June 4, 2003 through August 10, 2003.  Government-furnished elements:  OSD and other participating components serviced by WHS will provide office space and requisite office equipment for use by interns during their service.  Government Review and Approval:  A staff member of WHS, Personnel & Security will serve as the internal program manager to provide assistance to management officials and to interns, as required.  Also, will assess the effectiveness of the program at its completion to determine if it should continue in future years.  Reporting Requirements:  WHS, P&S will be continuously monitoring the process to ensure optimum placement opportunities, and overall quality and performance of interns once on board.  Will work closely with HACU to resolve any operational problems, which may arise, plus to assess the program at the end of the summer.  Control Procedures:  The WHS, P&S specialist will work closely with HACU's Program Manager to ensure the highest quality interns, and with OSD managers to ensure that realistic work opportunities are identified to match skills and requirements.  A continuous monitoring will be conducted to quickly and efficiently resolve any program problems.  Inspection and acceptance requirements:

The selection process will result in a group of highly qualified interns to be placed in participating offices.  Interns are subject to review in terms of qualifications and security requirements, and will be in-processed to the extent necessary upon their reporting dates.

(vii) Date(s) and place(s) of delivery and acceptance and FOB point: See Item number (v & vi) for dates/performance period.

(viii) The following provision applies to this acquisition: Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-1 entitled Instructions to Offerors – Commercial.  The following provision is being added as an Addendum: FAR 52.214-31 Facsimile Bids/Quotes.

(ix) The following provision does not apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-2 entitled Evaluation -- Commercial Items.  Award will be based on the best value to the Government, considering price and other non-price factors (ability to meet solicitation requirements and past history). 

(x) Offers are to include a completed copy of provision FAR 52.212-3 entitled Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items.  Also if your company is a vendor not registered to do business with the Government, check web address: <http://www.dlis.dla.mil/ccr> and provide company’s CAGE Code with offer.

<DESC>CBD COMBINED/SYNOPSIS SOLICTATION

(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source – National Association of Equal Employment Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO) under authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Persons may identify their interest and capability (statement) to respond to the requirement (see xvi).  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  See numbered Note 22 for further specifics.

(ii) This Solicitation MDA94603T0046 is a Request for Quote (RFQ) for summer interns. 

(iii) This Solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-13, effective March 18, 2003.

(iv) The applicable North American Industry Classification System code is 611310 and the corresponding size standard is $6.0 million.  The Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program does not cover this procurement.

(v) & (vi) CLIN 0001:  Provide four (4) African-American Interns for employment at the Department of Defense (DOD) during Summer 2003 (June 2, 2003 through August 8, 2003).  National Association of Equal Employment Opportunity in Higher Education Internship Program General Requirement:  The Department of Defense is committed to increasing representation of persons of African-American backgrounds within the overall DoD work force.  A key method of accomplishing this requirement is to better inform students attending historically black colleges and universities of employment possibilities with DoD upon graduation through temporary internships of such students in DoD facilities during summer break.  How the Requirement Developed:  In 1987, the National Association for Equal Employment Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO) was awarded a grant by the U.S. Department of Defense to increase participation of HBCU’s and Minority Institutions (Mis) in DoD sponsored activities.  In March 1999, the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense, Force Management Policy stated that supporting the NAFEO internship program is a “valuable and effective way of introducing talented young men and women to the challenges and rewards of public service.”  The NAFEO internship program provides opportunities for students from participating Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to work at government agencies in order to provide the students with the opportunity to meet executive and senior staff officers and engage in meaningful dialogue, learning experiences and interactions with federal officials.  The use of the internship program provided by NAFEO enables DoD to bring into the workplace a number of highly qualified individuals.  By obtaining NAFEO’s services, these interns remain employees of NAFEO, which is more expeditious method of recruitment than employing persons who would have become temporary Federal employees during the summer period.  Overall Program Objectives:  The primary goal is to continue to increase the visibility of DoD within the African American community in order to enhance employment opportunities for a wide range of persons.  The expectation is that the interns who work within DoD offices will either themselves apply for permanent positions within DoD upon graduation, or at the very least, communicate a favorable impression of DoD as an employer to fellow students, family members, and friends.  Specific Objectives:  Participating interns are provided employment placement to the maximum extent possible into offices closely matching their areas of interest and expertise.  This will serve the two-fold purpose of ensuring that they are able to use their skills in meaningful employment opportunities, and that the offices to which they are assigned achieve maximum benefit of their skills and knowledge in specific functional areas of science, management, financial operations, technology, program planning, or other fields of study.  Supplier Requirements:  NAFEO will provide the following services:  recruitment of participants; employment (receiving and processing applications); orientation in Washington, DC prior to entry on duty; developmental activities; support services such as program handbooks and updates, communication; housing assistance; travel expenses to DC area; program evaluation.  Direction on Specific Methodologies to be used:  Merit principles and careful matching of candidate to employment opportunities.  Applicability of Specification and Standards:  Interns will be fully qualified in specific skill set forth by offices in which employed, and will meet any security requirements.  Period of Performance:  The period of this performance period is for one fiscal year beginning June 2, 2003 through August 8, 2003.  Government-furnished elements:  Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and other participating components serviced by Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) will provide office space and requisite office equipment for use by interns during their service.  Review and Approval:  A staff member of WHS, Personnel and Security Directorate (P&SD) will serve as the internal program manager to provide assistance to management officials and to interns as required.  Also, will assess the effectiveness of the program as its completion to determine if it should continue in future years.  Reporting Requirements:  The WHS, P&SD will be continuously monitoring the process to ensure optimum placement opportunities, and overall quality and performance of interns once on board.  Will work closely with NAFEO to resolve any operational problems that may arise, plus to assess the program at the end of the summer.  Control Procedures:  The WHS, P&SD specialist will work closely with NAFEO’s Program Manager to ensure the highest quality interns, and with OSD managers to ensure that realistic work opportunities are identified to match skills and requirements.  A continuous monitoring will be conducted to quickly and efficiently resolve any program problems.  Inspection and Acceptance Requirements:  The selection process will result in a group of highly qualified interns to be placed in participating offices.  Interns are subject to review in terms of qualifications and security requirements, and will be in-processed to the extent necessary upon their reporting dates.

(vii) Date(s) and place(s) of delivery and acceptance and FOB point: See Item number (v & vi) for dates/performance period.

(viii) The following provision applies to this acquisition: Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-1 entitled Instructions to Offerors – Commercial.  The following provision is being added as an Addendum: FAR 52.214-31 Facsimile Bids/Quotes.

(ix) The following provision does not apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-2 entitled Evaluation -- Commercial Items.  Award will be based on the best value to the Government, considering price and other non-price factors (ability to meet solicitation requirements and past history).
